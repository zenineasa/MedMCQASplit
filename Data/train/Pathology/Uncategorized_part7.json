As an aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions is the most common cause, organisms most commonly causing lung abscess are those normally found in the oral cavity, i. e., Anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, peptococcus species). Other organisms are S. aureus, Klebsiella, Nocardia and gram-negative bacteria. Morphology Pulmonary abscesses due to aspiration are more common on the right side because of the more vertical direction of the right main bronchus. Most often abscess is single. The cardinal histologic change in all abscesses is the suppurative destruction of the lung parenchyma within the central area of cavitation.",

Sometimes the chamber radius is increased and the wall thickness is increased moderately - this is termed eccentric hyperophy - and can occur when there is both volume and pressure overload. An example of this would be when systolic dysfunction and a volume overload state occur in a concentrically hyperophied hea, thus stimulating chronic chamber dilation.

Direct seeding of body cavities or surface o It occurs when a malignant neoplasm penetrates into a natural open field. o Most common cavity involved is peritoneal cavity, but other cavities may also be involved, e. g., pleural, pericardial, joint space, subarachnoid. Such seeding is paicularly characteristic of carcinomas arising in the ovaries. o Sometimes mucus secreting tumor of appendix (or less commonly ovary) fill the peritoneal cavity with a gelatinous neoplastic mass referred to as pseudomyxoma peritonei. 2. Lymphatic spread o This is the most common method of metastasis for carcinomas. Sarcoma may also use this route. o As tumors do not have lymphatics, this type of spread takes place through the lymphatic vessels located at the tumor margins. The pattern of lymph node involvement follows the natural routes of lymphatic drainage. o The first node in a regional lymphatics that receives lymph flow from the primary tumor is called sentinel lymphnode. Some times local lymph nodes may be bypassed because of venous lymphatic anastomosis -4 skip metastasis. 3. Hematogenous spread It is typical of sarcomas but is also seen in carcinomas. o Veins are more commonly involved than aeries because veins have thinner walls that can be penetrated readily, in contrast aeries have thicker walls. With venous invasion, the tumor cells in blood follow the venous flow draining the site of neoplasm. So, liver and lung are the most frequent organs involved in hematogenous spread because all poal area drainage flows to the liver and all caval blood flows to the lung. o Aerial spread may occur when tumor cells pass through the pulmonary capillary beds or pulmonary A-V shunts or when pulmonary metastasis give rise to additional tumor emboli.",

Most common cranial nerve dysfunction is hearing loss Pupillary asymmetry usually results due to an abnormality of 2nd or 3rd nerve. The 2nd nerve is cortical and 3rd nerve is related to the midbrain so quite obviously they will not get involved in craniovertebral junctional anomaly.",

The other thing to remember about medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is that it can be a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes type IIa (parathyroid disease, pheochromocytomas, medullary carcinoma) and type IIb (parathyroid disease, pheochromocytomas, medullary carcinoma, mucocutaneous ganglioneuromas, Marfanoid habitus).

The older a person becomes, the more attrition is exhibited. Attrition commences at the time, the contact or occlusion occurs between adjacent or opposing teeth. It may be seen in the deciduous dentition as well as in the permanent, but severe attrition is seldom seen in primary teeth because they are not retained for any great period of time.

        "exp": "Most cases of Tay-Sachs disease are caused by inseion of four nucleotides into the coding region of the gene for the alpha-subunit of the hexosaminidase A gene.

The disease presents as described in the question, and is more common in Ashkenazi Jews. The carrier rate in this population is 1 in 25. There is presently no effective treatment and survival beyond four years of age is rare. Confined placental mosaicism is caused by a genetic aberration (e. g., a trisomy) occurring in the trophoblast or extraembryonic progenitor cells in the inner cell mass of the embryo. This leads to abnormal placental development and intrauterine growth retardation. Expansion of tandem nucleotide repeats is thought to be etiologically involved in Fragile X syndrome and Huntington disease.

Null cells (Large granular lymphocytes) Null cells are called so because they lack features of surface markers of both B and T lymphocytes. The account for 5 to 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes. They are also called \"large granular lymphocytes (LGL)\"as they contain large azurophilic cytoplasmic granules. They express Surface receptors for the Fc poion of IgG (CD-16) NCAM-I (CD56) They proliferate in response to IL-2 Many LGL express some lineage marker paicularly CD-8, CD-2. LGLs arise in both bone marrow and thymic microenvironment. Members of this group are: 1. Antibody dependent cytotoxic cells (ADCC) ADCC possess surface receptors for the Fc pa of Ig. Capable of lysing or killing target cells sensitized with IgG. 2. Natural killer cells (NK Cells) Possess spontaneous cytotoxicity towards various target cells: - Virus infected cells Malignant cells Transplanted foreign cells Cytotoxicity is not antibody dependent or MHC restricted Activity is nonimmune as it does not require sensitization by prior antigenic contact. They have CD-56 and CD-16 on their surface IL-2 acts as a growth factor Natural killer cell activity is augmented by interferon. They release perforin which causes transmembrane pores through which TNF-f3 enters the cell and induce apoptosis. NK cells are activated to LAK cells in the presence of IL-2 Usually CD-3 negative but subset of NK cells are CD-3 positive called NK/T cells. NK cells secrete TNF-a, GMCSF, perforin, IL-4. NK cells do not kill normal cells. Why is it so? lets see:? The NK cells express activating and inhibiting receptors. The functional activity of the NK cells is regulated by a balance between signal from these receptors. MHC class I molecules has inhibiting signal on NK cells and normal cell are not killed because inhibiting signals from normal MHC class I molecules overside activating signals. The ability of NK cells to kill target cells is inversly related to target cell expression of MHC class I molecule. If virus infection or neoplastic transformation reduces the expression of MHC I, inhibitory signals are interrupted and lysis of target cells occur. 3. Lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells These are NK - cells treated with IL-2 Kill tumor cells more efficiently than unstimulated NK cents.",

The junctional nevus represents an early stage, in which th\u00e8ques of nevus cells are confined to the junction of the epithelium and connective tissue, especially at the tips of the rete ridges. As the nevus cells proliferate, they begin to drop off into the underlying dermis or lamina propria. When nevus cells are present along the junctional area and within the connective tissue, the lesion is called a compound nevus. In later stages, the nevus cells are found only within the connective tissue. In the skin, this stage is called an intradermal nevus; the intraoral counterpart is called an intramucosal nevus. Most intraoral melanocytic nevi are classified microscopically as intramucosal nevi. However, this finding probably reflects the age (average, 35 years) at which most oral nevi undergo biopsy and diagnosis, because these lesions would have evolved earlier through junctional and compound stages.

        "question": "Best predictor for coronary aery disease a. EUR'",
        "exp": "LDL???? Elevated LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol are independent predictors of coronary heart disease. - Although there is consensus regarding the benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol the value of elevating HDL cholesterol remains controversial. Low HDL and coronary risk High serum HDL cholesterol is associated with a lower risk of CHD. The incidence of CHD events in a normal population appears to be inversely related to serum HDL cholesterol with low levels being associated with increased coronary risk. - Based upon data. from the Framingham Hea study, the risk for myocardial infarction increases by about 25%. for every 5mg/d1 (. 13 nuno1/1) decrement in serum HDL cholesterol. Elevated LDL and coronary risk Elevation in LDL cholesterol is a well known risk factor for the development of coronary aery disease. Association of elevated LDL with coronary aery disease has been established in various trials and studies. There is linear reduction in cardiovascular disease with progressive lowering of the LDL cholesterol. Traditionally LDL levels are considered to be the nzost impoant factor in the prediction of coronary aery disease. The impoance of LDL as a risk factor lies in the fact that effective therapes are avalaible to lower it, while it is not so in the case of HDL. So when treating dyslipidemia for reducing cardiovascular events, the. first target is LDL and not HDL. Doubt and Controversy What is creating doubts in our mind is a table from Braunwald 8th/e p1008 according to which 'Low HDL' appears to be better marker, for prediction of future cardiovascular disease than 'High LDL'. According to this bar diagram in Braunnwald 8\"Ye p1008 - the adjusted hazard ratio. for. future cardiovascular events for LDL is 1. 62 while that of HDL is 2. 32. But the text given in the book does clarify which one is better marker. (we have give this table from Braunwald in our previous discussion on this topic in Nov 2009 Medicine). We have tried to confirm this low HDL' fact from various other books. But none of the texts clearly. ored any one between these 2 to be the better marker. Both LDL and HDL are mentioned to be impoant. We have also consulted several cardiologist on this. All of them say that the answer should be LDL Well, Braunwald is text book of immense reputation. and any information or text given in the book does not need confirmation from any other source. But what has added to the confusion is that the latest edition of Braunwald i. e., 9\"/e has eliminated that diagram from the book and in the text have not clarified which one is better marker. Instead, the text states that Apolipo (a) and B 100 are better marker,. for predicting future cardiovascular events than LDL and HDL. We are not absolutely sure of the answer, but we would for the time being go with LDL. Also Know The following lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are associated with increased coronary risk. - Elevated total cholesterol - Elevated LDL cholesterol Low HDL cholesterol - Increased total to HDL cholesterol ratio - Increased non HDL cholesterol - Hyperiglyceridemia - Increased Lp(a) - Increased apolipoprotein B - Sinai! dense LDL paicles",

That leads to formation of microthrombi throughout the microcirculation of the body, often in a quixotically even distribution. As a consequence of the thrombotic diathesis, there is consumption of platelets, fibrin and coagulation factors and secondary activation of fibrinolytic mechanism. Thus DIC can present with signs and symptoms relating to tissue hypoxia and infarction caused by the myriad microthrombi or as a hemorrhagic disorder related to depletion of elements required for homeostasis, hence the term consumption coagulopathy is used to describe D. I. C. DIC can also lead to hemolytic anemia. It occurs due to fragmentation of red cells as they try to squeeze through the narrowed microvasculature. Schistocytes, the cells characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are quite common in patients with D. I. C (seen in 50%) of the cause. Like D. I. C, T. T. P too is characterized by widespread thrombosis and similar to D. I. C, the disseminated thrombosis leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. But the point to emphasize is that in TT. P the thrombus is a platelet thrombus i. e. the thrombi is composed mainly of platelets aggregates so quite unlike D. I. C. the level of coagulation factors remain normal. Robbins' States \"While D. I. C. and thrombotic microangiopathies share features such as microvascular occlusion and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, they are pathogenetically distinct. In T. T. P and HITS (unlike DIC), activation of the coagulation cascade is not of primary importance, and hence results of laboratory tests of coagulation such as PT and PTT are usually normal. \"",

Cells have developed elaborate mechanisms to monitor the integrity of the genetic material. A number of complex multisubunit enzyme systems are involved in repair of damaged DNA or to prevent any error during DNA synthesis. Despite the elaborate proofreading system employed during DNA synthesis, errors including base pairing or inseion of one to a few extra nucleotides can occur. In addition, DNA is constantly being subjected to environmental insults that cause the alteration or removal of nucleotide bases. - Base are also altered or lost spontaneously from mammalian DNA at a rate many thousands per cell per day. - If the damage is not repaired a permanent mutation (genomic instability) may be introduced that can result in any of a number of deleterious effects including loss of control over the proliferation of a mutated cell leading to cancer. Luckily cells are remarkably efficient at repairing damage done to their DNA. When there is a defect in DNA the cell cycle stops for a while, allowing the damaged DNA time for repair. If the DNA cannot be repaired it undergoes apoptosis. Most of the repair systems involve:? - Recognition of the damage on the DNA - Removal or excision of the damage - Replacement or, filling the gap left by excision using sister strand as template for DNA synthesis - Typically genomic instability occurs when both copies of the DNA repair gene are lost, however recent work has suggested that even a subset of these genes may promote cancer in haploinsufficient manner. Persons with defect in DNA repair continue to replicate damaged DNA rather than stopping to allow repair or undergoing apoptosis. -There are several inherited disorders in which genes that encode proteins involved in DNA repair are defective. - Individuals born with such inherited defects in DNA repair proteins are at a greatly increased risk of developing cancer. - The defect in DNA repair protein leads to genomic instability which enables malignancy. - DNA repairing genes themselves are not oncogenic but their abnormalities allow mutations in other genes during the process of normal cell division. Three types of DNA repair defects contributes to different types of cancers Mismatch repair Nucleotide excision repairQ Recombination repair",

Infrarenal abdominal aoa is most frequently affected by the atherosclerotic process and is the most common site of aneurysm formation. Abdominal aoa is more prone to develop aneurysm because it is less elastic, resulting from less elastin and more collagen, and it has higher pulsatile stress compared with ascending aoa. Media of infrarenal aoa in humans has no vaso vasorum, so inner media receive nutrition by diffusion from aoic lumen. Intimal thickening by atherosclerosis disturbs nutrition and hence wall nutrition.

Both CD4+ and CD8+T cells recognize and attack host tissues. o In clinical practice GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between HIA matched donor and recipient. o Acute GVH disease occurs within days to weeks after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. o Although any organ may be affected, the major clinical manifestation results from involvement of the immune system and epithelia of the skin, liver and intestines. o Involvement of the skin in GVH disease is manifested by a generalized rash leading to desquamation in severe cases. o Destruction of small bile ducts gives rise to jaundice and mucosal ulceration of the gut results in bloody diarrhoea. o Immunodeficiency is a frequent accompaniment of GVH disease. The immunodeficiency may be a result of prior treatment, myeloablative preparation for the graft, a delay in repopulation of the recipient's immune system and attack on host's immune cells by grafted lymphocytes. o Affected individuals are profoundly immunosuppressed and are easy prey to infections.

Both HSV-1 (which produces most cold sores) and HSV-2 (which produces most genital herpes) are ubiquitous and contagious. They can be spread when an infected person is producing and shedding the virus. Symptoms of herpes simplex virus infection include watery blisters in the skin or mucous membranes of the mouth, lips or genitals Lesions heal with a scab characteristic of herpetic disease. However, as neurotropic and neuroinvasive viruses, HSV-1 and -2 persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system in the cell bodies of neurons. After the initial or primary infection, some infected people experience sporadic episodes of viral reactivation or outbreaks. In an outbreak, the virus in a nerve cell becomes active and is transpoed the neuron's axon to the skin, where virus replication and shedding occur and cause new sores. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis is the most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis worldwide. The clinical syndrome is often characterized by the rapid onset of fever, headache, seizures, focal neurologic signs, and impaired consciousness",

Large emboli may impact in the main pulmonary artery or its major branches or lodge at the bifurcation as a saddle embolus. Sudden death often ensues, owing largely to the blockage of blood flow through the lungs. Death may also be caused by the acute failure of the right side of the heart (acute cor pulmonale). Smaller emboli can travel out into the more peripheral vessels, where they may cause infarction. In patients with adequate cardiovascular function, the bronchial arterial supply can often sustain the lung parenchyma despite obstruction to the pulmonary arterial system. Under these circumstances, haemorrhages may occur, but there is no infraction of the underlying lung parenchyma. Only about 10% of emboli actually cause infarction. Although the underlying pulmonary architecture may be obscured by the suffusion of blood, haemorrhages are distinguished by the preservation of the pulmonary alveolar architecture; in such cases, resorption of the blood permits reconstitution of the preexisting architecture.",

Genetic Aging is a genetic program activated in post-reproductive life when an individual's evolutionary mission is accomplished. Oxidative stress Accumulation of oxidative damage of DNA, proteins and lipids interferes with normal function and produces a decrease in stress response. Mitochondrial dysfunction A common deletion in mitochondrial DNA with age compromises function and alters cell metabolic processes and adaptability to environment change. Hormonal changes The decline and loss of circadian rhythm in secretion of some hormones produces a functional hormone deficiency state. Telomerase shoening Aging is related to a decline in the ability of cell to replicate. Defective host defeness The failure of the immune system to responds to infectious agents and the overactivity of natural immunity create vulnerability to environment stresses. Accmulation of senescent cells Renewing tissues become dysfunctional through loss ofability to renew.

C: Megaloblastic anemia The diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is based on leucopenia with hypersegmented granulocytes, a moderate to severe Megaloblastic anemia, elevated levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid in the serum and low serum vitamin B12. Hypersegmented neutrophil Normally, the number of segments in the nucleus of a neutrophil increases as it matures and ages, after being released into the blood from the bone marrow. Whereas normal neutrophils only contain three or four nuclear lobes (the \"segments\"), hypersegmented neutrophils contain five or more lobes. Hypersegmented neutrophils have classically been thought to be pathognomonic of the megaloblastic anemias (anemias caused by failure of bone marrow blood-forming cells to make DNA, often caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies, or DNA-replication poisons). One of the earliest, notable changes in the peripheral blood in megaloblastic processes is the appearance of hypersegmented neutrophils. Because of the sho life-span of neutrophils, these abnormal hypersegmented neutrophils characteristically appear even before the onset of anemia in megaloblastic processes. Such neutrophils are less often seen in the other classes of anemia, which together are far more common than megaloblastic types of anemia. Note that pernicious anemia is a type of megaloblastic anemia, and as such, is expected to show hypersegmented neutrophils.",

They represent about 60% of tumors in the parotid, are less common in the submandibular glands, and are relatively rare in the minor salivary glands. Pleomorphic adenomas are benign tumors that consist of a mixture of ductal (epithelial) and myoepithelial cells, so they exhibit both epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation. Epithelial elements are dispersed throughout the matrix, which may contain variable mixtures of myxoid, hyaline, chondroid (cartilaginous), and even osseous tissue. In some pleomorphic adenomas, the epithelial elements predominate; in others, they are present only in widely dispersed foci. This histologic diversity has given rise to the alternative, albeit less preferred name mixed tumor. The tumors consistently overexpress the transcription factor PLAG1, often because of chromosomal rearrangements involving the PLAG1 gene, but how PLAG1 contributes to tumor development is unknown. Pleomorphic adenomas typically manifest as rounded, well-demarcated masses rarely exceeding 6 cm in the greatest dimension. Although they are encapsulated, in some locations (particularly the palate), the capsule is not fully developed, and expansile growth produces protrusions into the surrounding tissues. The cut surface is grey-white and typically contains myxoid and blue translucent chondroid (cartilage-like) areas. The most striking histologic feature is their characteristic heterogeneity. Epithelial elements resembling ductal or myoepithelial cells are arranged in ducts, acini, irregular tubules, strands, or even sheets. These typically are dispersed within a mesenchyme-like background of loose myxoid tissue containing islands of chondroid and, rarely, foci of bone (Fig. 14-6). Sometimes the epithelial cells form well-developed ducts lined by cuboidal to columnar cells with an underlying layer of deeply chromatic, small myoepithelial cells. In other instances, there may be strands or sheets of myoepithelial cells. Islands of well-differentiated squamous epithelium also may be present. In most cases, no epithelial dysplasia or mitotic activity is evident. No difference in biologic behaviour has been observed between the tumors composed largely of epithelial elements and those composed largely of mesenchymal elements.",

CD 14 binds bacterial LPS (endotoxin) and, as a component of a multimolecular complex, plays an important role in LPS-induced activation, inflammatory response, and innate immunity. LPS is captured by a serum LPS-binding protein and is transported to CD14, which binds the complex. CD14, however, cannot trigger activation because it lacks an intracellular region. This function is mediated by one of a group of molecules known as Toll-like receptors (TLR), as they are structurally homologous to the Toll receptors of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.",

Essentially these tumours make up a family of neoplasms that develop from the paraganglial tissues which are atually chemoreceptor organs that are distributed throughout the body. These chemoreceptor organs are of neural crest origin and have similar functions and similar histological appearance. Their cells of origin are a pa of the diffuse neuroendocrine system (DNES). Paragangliomas are composed of characteristic cell called 'C' cell. The chief cell is probably the principal component involved and seems to be the actual chemoreceptor of the paraganglia containing acetyl choline, catecholamine and serotonin. Chief cell is of neural crest origin and it contains hormone thus it is neuroendocrine in nature. It renders the paraganglia receptive to hypoxia and pH changes and to fluctuations in blood carbon dioxide concentration. These chief cells migrate with the autonomic ganglion cells. They are in close association with the sympathetic ganglia and Aoa in its main branches. Many head and neck paraganglia and their respective neoplasms are distributed in relation to the vessel and cranial nerves of the primitive branchial arches. Because of this they are also called branchiomeric paraganglioma. Pathology of paraganglioma: Like other neuroendocrine tumour the ultrastructure shows dense core granules (neurosecretory grangules) The tumour cells balls are arranged in distinctive cell balls called Zellaballen (the cell balls are composed of chief cells). These cells are separated by fibrovascular stroma and surrounded by sustentacular cells. Immunohistochemistry of paraganglioma Chief cells are neuroendocrine cells and are thus positive for regular neuroendocrine markers e. g. Chromogranin Synaptophysin Neuron specific enolase Serotonin Neurofilament The chief cells are S-100 protein negative but the sustentacular cells are S-100 positive and are focally positive for glial fibrillary acid protein. On histochemistry they are argyrophilic. PAS negative, mucicarnzine negative and argentalfin negative. An impoant point in d/d is that they are never positive for cytokeratin like other neuroendocrine tumours.",

Such injury may be caused by a great variety of initiating insults, the most frequent of which are shock, severe trauma, sepsis, and gastric aspiration. All these different forms of injury result in recruitment of neutrophils within the alveolar capillaries. Neutrophils release chemokines that attract histiocytes and produce oxygen radicals, prostaglandins, and proteases that damage alveolar epithelium. Formation of hyaline membranes is due to a combination of plasma fluid extravasation and alveolar cell necrosis. CD4+ (helper) lymphocytes, CD8+ (cytotoxic) lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells have been implicated in a number of pulmonary diseases, but not in diffuse alveolar damage.

A. Physiological hyperplasia o It occurs when there is increased physiological demand e. g (a) Hormonal --> Hyperplasia of endometrium in pregnant uterus, proliferation of the glandular epithelium of female breast at pubey and during pregnancy. (b) Compensatory --> Increase in tissue mass after damage or paial resection, e. g. regeneration of liver after paial hepatectomy. B. Pathological hyperplasia o It occurs when there is increased stimulus under ceain pathologic conditions. o Most forms of pathological hyperplasia are caused by excessive hormonal stimulation or growth factor acting on target cells, e. g., Endometrial hyperplasia due to disturbed estrogen and progesterone balance (with relative excess of estrogen) in menstural cycle. Note: Stimulus for physiologic and pathologic hyperplasia may be the same (e. g., estrogen for endometrial hyperplasia), but in physiologic hyperplasia, the stimulus is due to normal physiologic changes of body e. g., pregnancy, while in pathologic hyperplasia the stimulus is due to ceain pathologic conditions e. g., estrogen secreting ovarian tumor. o Although pathological hyperplasia is abnormal, the process remains controlled --> Hyperplasia regresses if the hormonal stimulation is eliminated. o It is the response to the normal regulatory control mechanisms that distinguishes benign pathological hyperplasia from Cancer, in which the growth control mechanism becomes defective. o However, pathological hyperplasia constitues a feile soil in which cancerous proliferation may eventually arise --> e. g., patients with endometrial hyperplasia are at increase risk of endometrial carcinoma Mechanism of hyperplasia o Hyperplasia is caused by increased production of growth factor or hormones that lead to production of transcription factor that turn on many cellular genes and induce cellular proliferation. o After some type of cell loss, hyperplasia is caused not only by proliferation of cells but also by the development of new cells from stem cells --> e. g., After hepatectomy the hyperplasia is due to proliferation of the remaining hepatocytes, but in chronic hepatitis, intrahepatic stem cells play a major role in hyperplasia as the proliferative capacity of hepatocytes is compromised.",

        "exp": "The patient has chronic bronchitis, which has been clinically defined to be chronic cough with copious sputum production that has been present for at least 3 months in 2 consecutive years. Smoking and inhalation of other irritating substances (including smog) are usually associated. While the sputum production of early chronic bronchitis is the result of hyperophy of submucosal glands in larger bronchi, in late and more severe cases, goblet cell metaplasia of bronchioles and small bronchi also contributes significantly to the mucus production. Other microscopic changes that occur include increased infiltration of small airways by alveolar macrophages and fibrosis of bronchiolar walls (that may even obliterate lumina). Smooth muscle hyperophy can be seen in larger bronchi, and is related to the increased effo needed to clear bronchi of copious amounts of mucus, but does not cause increased mucus production. Squamous cell metaplasia is seen as a reaction to irritation (often by smoking) in the larger bronchi. It is related to increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in smokers, but not increased mucus production. Type I pneumocytes are the normal, flat, lining cells of alveoli.

        "exp": "\"At birth, human telomeres are 15- to 20-kb pairs long and are composed of tandem repeats of a sixnucleotide sequence (TTAGGG) that associates with specialized telomere-binding proteins to form a Tloop structure that protects the ends of chromosomes from being mistakenly recognized as damaged. The loss of telomeric repeats with each cell division cycle causes gradual telomere shortening, leading to growth arrest (called senescence) when one or more critically short telomeres trigger a p53-regulated DNA-damage checkpoint response\"- How dividing cells can count their divisions is under intensive investigation. One likely mechanism is that with each cell division, there is incomplete replication of chromosome ends (telomere shortening), which ultimately results in cell cycle arrest. Telomeres are short repeated sequences of DNA (TTAGGG) present at the linear ends of chromosomes that are important for ensuring the complete replication of chromosome ends and protecting chromosomal termini from fusion and degradation. When soma tic cells replicate, a small section ofthe telomere is not duplicated, and telomeres become progressively shortened. As the telomeres become shorter, the ends of chromosomes cannot be protected and are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. The lengths of the telomeres are normally maintained by nucleotide addition mediated by an enzyme called telomerase. Telomerase is a specialized RNA-protein complex that uses its own RNA as a template for adding nucleotides to the ends of chromosomes The activity of telomerase is repressed by regulatory proteins, which restrict telomere elongation, thus providing a length sensing mechanism. Telomerase activity is expressed in germ cells and is present at low levels in stem cells, but it is usually absent in most somatic tissues. Therefore, as cells age, their telomeres become shorter, and they exit the cell cycle, resulting in an inability to generate new cells to replace damaged ones. Conversely, in immortal cancer cells, telomerase is reactivated, and telomeres are not shortened, suggesting that telomere elongation might be an important-possibly essential-step in tumor formation. Despite such alluring observations, however, the relationship of telomerase activity and telomeric length to aging and cancer still needs to be fully established Germ cells and stem cells both contain active telomerase, but only the germ cells have sufficient levels of the enzyme to stabilize telomere length completely. Telomerase activation in cancer cells inactivates the teleomericclock that limits the proliferative capacity of normal somatic cells.",

        "exp": "There are hundreds of mutations within the beta globin gene, but approximately 20 different alleles comprise 80% of the mutations found world wide. Within each geographic population there are unique mutations. Individuals who have beta thalassemia major are usually homozygous for one of the common mutations, or heterozygous for one of the common mutations and one of the geographically-unique mutations. Both lead to absence of beta globin chain production. The beta thalassemia syndromes are much more diverse than the alpha thalassemia syndromes due to the diversity of the mutations that produce the defects in the beta globin gene. Unlike the deletions that constitute most of the alpha thalassemia syndromes, beta thalassemias are caused by mutations on chromosome 11 that affect all aspects of beta globin production: transcription, translation, and the stability of the beta globin product. Most hematologists feel there are three general categories of beta thalassemia: beta thalassemia trait, beta thalassemia intermedia and beta thalassemia major. Splice site mutations also occur and are of clinical consequence, when combined with a thalassemia mutation. Three splice site mutations occur in exon 1 of the beta globin gene. These mutations result in three different abnormal hemoglobins: Malay, E, and Knossos. Hemoglobin E is a very common abnormal hemoglobin in the Southeast Asian population, and when paired with a b0 thalassemia mutation, can produce severe transfusion-dependent (Eb0) thalassemia. Hemoglobin E is described in the section on variant hemoglobins.",

A) Direct Pathway o Ceain cells in the graft express HLA antigen, of these dendritic cells (antigen presenting cells) in the transplant is paicularly impoant. o That means, T cells of the recipient recognize antigen (HLA protein) on the antigen presenting cells of the transplant (donor tissue). o Two types of cells are involved in this pathway. (i) CD-4 T cells --> Recognize HLA-II on antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells) and differentiate into Till cells that secretes cytokines. These cytokines induce inflammatory reaction with local accumulation of mononuclear cells paicularly macrophages which destroye the graft tissue. (ii) CD-8 T cells Recognize HLA-I on APCs and differentiate into cytotoxic-T cells that kill the graft tissue by ---> (i) Perforin - granzyme - dependent killing or (ii) Fas-fas ligand dependent killing. B) Indirect pathway o In this pathway HLA molecule of the graft tissue is taken up by antigen presenting cells of the recepient and is presented to CD4 T cells of the recipient.

Radiographic findings-hea is roughly normal size. The curve of the right hea margin is tall. The cardiac apex is elevated above tile diaphragm. There is a visible aoic knuckle.

Normally, ACTH is released from the pituitary gland when necessary to stimulate the release of coisol from the adrenal glands. In pituitary Cushing's, a benign pituitary adenoma secretes ACTH. This is also known as Cushing's disease and is responsible for 65% of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. In adrenal Cushing's, excess coisol is produced by adrenal gland tumors, hyperplastic adrenal glands, or adrenal glands with nodular adrenal hyperplasia. Finally, tumors outside the normal pituitary-adrenal system can produce ACTH that affects the adrenal glands.

        "question": "Sequence of events in acute inflammation?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Transient vasoconstriction --> Vasodilatation -+ Increased permeability --> Stasis Acute inflammation o Acute inflammation is a rapid response to an injurious agent that serves to deliver mediators of host defense, i. e., leukocytes and plasma proteins, to the site of injury. o Acute inflammation has three major steps:? 1. Alteration in vascular caliber that leads to an increase in blood flow, i. e., vasodilatation. Structural changes in the microvasculature that permit plasma proteins and leukocytes to leave the circulation, i. e., Increased vascular permeaility. 3. Emigration of the leukocytes from the microcirculation, their accumulation in the focus of injury, and their activation to eliminate the offending agent i. e., chemotoxis and phagocytosis. o These inflammatory change involve two main components. A. Vascular reaction i. e., changes in blood vssels. B. Cellular reaction i. e., changes in leukocytes. A. Vascular events Vascular changes are essential for inflammation because these changes serve to deliver leukocytes and antibodies (two major mechanisms of host defence against microbes) at the site of injury. Normally leukocytes and immunoglobulins are sequestered inside the vesels and move in the direction of flow. During inflammation blood flow is increased to inflammed area and these leukocytes and immunoglubulin are directed towards the injurious stimulus. 1. Changes in vascular caliber (vasodilatation) o Vasodilatation is one of the earliest manifestations of acute inflammation. o Sometimes, it follows a transient constriction of aerioles, (vasoconstrictions) lasting for a few seconds ---> Though vasodilatation is the earliest manifestation of acute inflammation, it follows a transient period of vasoconstriction. o Vasodilatation first involve aerioles and than results in opening of new capillary beds in the area. o There is increased hydrostatic pressure due to increased blood flow. Change in vascular permeability o Vasodilatation is quickly followed by increased vascular permeability. o Increased vascular permeabily is the hallmark of acute inflammation. o This leads to escape of protein rich fluid (exudate) and leukocytes into extravascular space. o Intravascular osmotic pressure reduces due to exudation of proteins and osmotic pressure of interstitial fluid is increased. o Together with increased hydrostatic pressure and decreased intravascular osmotic pressure leads to fuher outflow of fluid and its accumulation in the interstitial fluid. Change in vascular flow (Stasis) o The loss of fluid results in concentration of red cells and increased viscosity of blood Slower blood flow ---> Stasis B. Cellular events A critical function of inflammation is to deliver leukocytes to the site of injury and to activate the leukocytes to perform their normal functions in host defence. Leukocytes ingest offending agents, kill bacteria and other microbes, and get rid of necrotic tissue and foreign substances. The sequence of events in the journey of leukocytes from the vessel lumen to interstitial tissue is called extravasation. Extravasation involves following steps. 1. In the vessel lumen o As stasis develops, leukocytes principally neutrophils accumulute along the vascular endothelium. This is called margination. o The rows of leukocytes move (tumble) slowly along the endothelium a process called rolling. o Finally coming to at rest, leukocytes adhere firmly to endothelium --> adhesion. o The endothelium can be virually lined by white cells ---> Pavementing. 2. Diapedesis o It is the process of transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium. o After firm adhesion, leukocytes migrate through interendothelial junctions and assume a position between endothelial cells and the basement membrane. o Eventually, they pierce the basement membrane by secreting collegenase and escape into the extravascular space. o The processes of adhesion and transmigration are regulated largely by the binding of complementry adhesion molecules on the leukocytes and endothelium. o These adhesion molecules include - Selectins, integrins, members of immunoglobulin superfamily and mucin like glycoproteins. o Different cytokines increase surface expression or avidity of these adhesion molecules and enhance adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes. o Leukocyte diapedesis, similar to increased vascular permeability, occurs predominantly in the venules (except in lungs, where it occurs in capillaries). 3. Chemotaxis o After extravasation, leukocytes emigrate into tissues toward the site of injury, along a chemical gradient, a process know as chemotaxis. o The substances that act as chemoattractant may be exogenous (bacterial products) or endogenous (C5a, LT4, IL-8) 4. Leukocyte activation o At the site of inflammation, cytokines induce a number of responses in leukocytes that are pa of defensive functions of leukocytes and are referred as leukocyte activation. o The functional responses that are induced on leukocyte activation are: - i) Production of archidonic acid metabolites (PGs, LTs) as result of activation of phospholipase A,. ii) Degranulation and secretion of lysosomal enzymes and activation of the oxidative burst. iii) Secretion of cytokines iv) Modulation of leukocyte adhesion molecules, allowing a firm adhesion of activated neutrophils to endothelium. 5. Phagocytosis o Phagocytosis and release of enzymes by neutrophils and macrophages are responsible for eliminating the injurious agents. o In phagocytosis, engulfment and killing & degradation of injurious agent takes place.",

ABOUT NEUROPSYCHIATRIC MANIFESTATIONS Neurological manifestations are used to distinguish between Hemolytic uremic syndrome and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura. H. U. S. is distinguished from T. T. P by the absence of neurological symptoms and the prominence of acute renal failure. Recent studies, however have tended to blurr these clinical distinctions. Many adult patients with \"TT. R \"lack one or more of the five criteria and patients with \"HUS\" have fever and neurological dysfunction. Hemolvtic uremic syndrome Hemolytic uremic syndrome is characterized by the triad of: Anemia (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia). Renal failure (microangiopathy of kidney involving glomerular capillaries and aerioles). Thrombocytopenia (due to platelet consumption). Hemolytic uremic syndrome is most common is children under 2 years of age. It usually follows an episode of acute gastroenterities, often triggered by E coli. The prodrome is usually of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting. Sholy thereafter, signs and symptoms of acute hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure ensue. Sometimes neurological findings also occur. (But usually absent and differentiate HUS from TTP.) Rarely HUS may follow respiratory tract infection. Etiology Gastrointestinal infection in infants with the following organism: E coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Streptococouus pneumoniae Hematological findings in a case of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia: Presence of schistocytes (fragmented red cells). This is the hallmark of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Neutrophil leukocytosis. Thrombocytopenia. Hemoglobinuria is mild to moderate with hemosiderinuria.

Differentiation Differentiation refers to the process by which a less specialized cell (immature) becomes a more specialized (mature) cell type, to perform a specific function. o All specialized cells are derived from stem cells that can give rise to various type of cells. o For example, hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow can give rise to red blood cells, or WBCs, or platelets through various stages of development. o This process of development from stem cells to mature cells is differentiation. So, in differentiation cells acquire a type. o For neoplastic cells, differentiation refers to the extent to which neoplastic cells resemble comparabale to normal cells, both morphologically and functionally -3 well differentiated cells resemble to normal cells, while undifferentiated cells do not resemble at all, poorly differentiated cells paially resemble to normal cells. Polarity It means orientation and organization of cells in a tissue, i. e. correct positioning of cells in a tissue. Pleomorphism o Pleomorphism is variation in size and shape. It may occur in cells or / and nuclei. Hyperchromatasia o Nuclei contain an abundance of DNA and are extremely dark staining --> hyperchromatic nuclei. Anaplasia o Anaplasia means lack of differentiation. o It means \"to form backward\", implying a reversion from a high level of differentiation to a lower level. o This does not mean that the differentiation takes place in reverse direction, i. e. from mature specialized cells to unspecialized stem cells. o Rather, Anaplasia arise from stem cells that proliferate without differentiation (maturation). o So, anaplastic cells resemble primitive-appearing unspecialized cells. o Anaplasia is seen in malignant tumors --) Anaplasia is considered a hallmark of malignant transformation. o But, It is not necessory that all malignant tumors are anaplastic (undifferentiated or poorly differentiated) some malignant tumors may be well differentiated, eg follicular carcinoma of thyroid.",

He initially noticed the swelling sholy after moving furniture for his new living room. He denies any nausea, vomiting, change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, or urinary tract symptoms. He has no other significant medical or surgical history. On examination, he has an enlarged right hemi-scrotum with a mass that appears to be originating at the level of the external inguinal ring. With the patient completely relaxed, the physician is able to reduce the mass by pushing it back through the external inguinal ring. With the mass reduced, the physician instructs the patient to perform a Valsalva maneuver, upon which a protrusion is felt at the external inguinal ring. Once the mass is reduced, the testicle appears normal in size and consistency. Which of the following pathological processes might cause the patient's underlying condition to occur in an infant?",
        "exp": "The pathologic process that causes hernias is different in neonates and infants than in an adult. Embryologically, in the seventh week, the testes begin descending from their location at the 10th thoracic level into the scrotum. After the eighth week, a peritoneal evagination called the processus vaginalis forms just anterior to the gubernaculum. The gubernaculum is a condensation of peritoneum that attaches superiorly to the gonad and inferiorly to the fascia that is developing between the external and internal oblique muscles in the region of the labioscrotal swellings. The processus vaginalis pushes out as a \"sock-like\" extension into the transversalis fascia, the internal oblique muscle, and the external oblique muscle, thus forming the inguinal canal. After the processus vaginalis has evaginated into the scrotum, the gubernaculum shoen and simply pull the gonads through the canal. Within the first year after bih, the superior poion of the processus vaginalis is usually obliterated, leaving only a distal remnant sac, the tunica vaginalis, which lies anterior to the testis. During infancy, this sac wraps around most of the testis. Its lumen is normally collapsed, but under pathologic conditions it may fill with serous secretions, forming a testicular hydrocele. If the processus vaginalis remains patent, a connection between the abdominal cavity and scrotal sac will occur. Loops of intestine may herniate into this processus, resulting in an indirect inguinal hernia. Note: In adults, hernias are caused by a protrusion of a structure, usually intestine, through a tissue that normally contains it. Direct inguinal hernias occur through the floor of the inguinal canal separate from the spermatic cord. Direct inguinal hernias occur because of a breakdown of the transversus abdominis aponeurosis and transversalis fascia. An indirect inguinal hernia occurs through the internal inguinal ring in a protrusion of peritoneum along the spermatic cord in the internal spermatic fascia. Therefore, a large indirect inguinal hernia will descend into the scrotum along the spermatic cord. Spigelian hernias are rare and occur due to a weakness in the linea semilunaris, which is located at the lateral margin of the rectus sheath. Ref: Sundaram S. S., Hoffenberg E. J., Kramer R.

Historically, the veical thickness of the primary tumor (Breslow thickness) and the anatomic depth of invasion (Clark level) have represented the dominant factors in the T classification. Whereas Clark used the histologic level, Breslow modified the approach to obtain a more reproducible measure of invasion by the use of an ocular micrometer. The lesions were measured from the granular layer of the epidermis or the base of the ulcer to the greatest depth of the tumor (I, 0. 75 mm or less; II, 0. 76 to 1. 5 mm; III, 1. 51 to 4. 0 mm; IV, 4. 0 mm or more).

        "exp": "The most likely diagnosis is an intracranial meningioma. Meningiomas are slow-growing, benign tumors comprising 15% of intracranial tumors; they are most common in the elderly. They originate from either dura mater or arachnoid and are sharply demarcated from brain tissue. Meningiomas often incite an osteoblastic reaction in the overlying cranial bones. Microscopically, the meningioma cells have a tendency to encircle one another, forming whorls and psammoma bodies. Clinically, they present as mass lesions; seizures may occur. The superior parasagittal surface of the frontal lobes is a orite site of origin. This can often produce leg weakness, since the leg motor fibers that pass down through the internal capsule originate in parasagittal coical regions. Treatment of meningiomas is usually surgical. Arachnoid cysts are formed by splitting of the arachnoid membrane; most arachnoid cysts arise near the Syln fissure. They may present with mass effect, but would be unlikely to produce seizures, prominent focal signs, or reactive hyperostosis. Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive malignant astrocytoma that would likely have killed the patient long before 5 years had elapsed. Metastatic breast cancer would generally look different microscopically (the whorling cell pattern is characteristic of meningioma). It would be unlikely for metastatic cancer to cause a reaction in the overlying bone, or to be present long enough to cause symptoms for 5 years. Ref: Johnson J., Lalwani A. K. (2012). Chapter 62.

Oedema occurs in conditions with diffuse glomerular disease such as in acute diffuse glomerulonephritis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (nephritic oedema). In contrast to nephrotic oedema, nephritic oedema is not due to hypoproteinaemia but is due to excessive reabsorption of sodium and water in the renal tubules via renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism. The protein content of oedema fluid in glomerulonephritis is quite low (less than 0. 5 g / dl).
