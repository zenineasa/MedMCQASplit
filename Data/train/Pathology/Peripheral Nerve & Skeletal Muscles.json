Also termed myasthenic-myopathic syndrome, the disease is usually associated with small cell carcinoma of the lung, although it may also occur in patients with other malignant diseases. Like myasthenia gravis, the disease seems to have an autoimmune basis because it can be transferred to mice by IgG from patients and it responds to treatment with corticosteroids. The pathogenic IgG autoantibodies recognize voltage-sensitive calcium channels that are expressed both in motor nerve terminals and in the cells of the lung cancer. The calcium channels, which are necessary for release of acetylcholine, are greatly reduced in the presynaptic membrane in these patients, thereby interfering with neuromuscular transmission. Antichannel antibodies are not encountered in the other choices. Diagnosis: Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e. Dense core granules Para gangliomas. The paraganglioma have been known historically by a variety of names including glomus tumours, chemodectoma, non chromaffin paraganglioma, glomercytomas, carotid body and tympanic body tumours and receptoma. Essentially these tumours make up a family of neoplasms that develop from the para ganglial tissues which are actually chemoreceptor organs that are distributed throughout the body. These chemoreceptor organs are of neural crest origin and have similar functions and similar histological appearance. Their cells of origin are a part of the diffuse neuroendocrine system (DNES). Para gangliomas are composed of characteristic cell called 'C' cell. The chief cell is probably the principal component involved and seems to be the actual chemoreceptor of the paraganglia containing acetyl choline, catecholamine and serotonin. Chief cell is of neural crest origin and it contains hormone thus it is neuroendocrine in nature. It renders the paraganglia receptive to hypoxia and pH changes and to fluctuations in blood carbon dioxide concentration. These chief cells migrate with the autonomic ganglion cells. They are in close association with the sympathetic ganglia and Aorta in its main branches. Many head and neck paraganglia and their respective neoplasms are distributed in relation to the vessel and cranial nerves of the primitive branchial arches. Because of this they are also called branchiomeric paraganglioma. Pathology of paraganglioma: Like other neuroendocrine tumour the ultrastructure shows dense core granules (' neurosecretory granules'). The tumour cells balls are arranged in distinctive cell balls called Zellballen (the cell balls are composed of chief cells). These cells are separated by fibrovascular stroma and surrounded by sustentacular cells. Immunohistochemistry of paraganglioma. Chief cells are neuroendocrine cells and are thus positive for regular neuroendocrine markers e. g. Chromogranin. Synaptophysin. Neuron specific enolase. Serotonin. Neurofilament. The chief cells are S-100 protein negative but the sustentacular cells are S-100 positive and are focally positive for glial fibrillary acid protein. On histochemistry they are argyrophilic, PAS negative, mucicarmine negative and argentaffin negative. An important point in d/d is that they are never positive for cytokeratin like other neuroendocrine tumours.",

Ganglion and Synovial Cysts: A ganglion is a small (<1. 5 cm) cyst located near a joint capsule or tendon sheath; the wrist is an especially common site. Lesions manifest as firm to fluctuant pea-sized nodules. These are grossly translucent and microscopically lack a true cell lining, because they arise by cystic degeneration of connective tissue. Lesions can be multilocular through coalescence of adjacent areas of myxoid change. The cyst fluid is similar to synovial fluid, although there is no communication with the joint space. Ganglions are usually completely asymptomatic. Classically, these can be treated by \"Bible therapy\"; whacking them with a large tome is usually sufficient to rupture the cyst, and re- accumulation is uncommon. Herniation of synovium through a joint capsule or massive enlargement of a bursa can produce a synovial cyst. A good example is the Baker cyst that occurs in the popliteal fossa. GANGLION CYST (WRIST CYST, BIBLE CYST, OR DORSAL TENDON CYST)# It may also be referred to as a mucous cyst, a mucinous cyst or a synovial cyst.# These are the most common swellings in the hand.# The swelling is smooth, well defined, fluctuant and transilluminable.# It is usually attached to a tendon sheath (lining which lubricates the tendon) in the hand or wrist;# Whether this is due to injury, a myxomatous degenerative process, or a subtle abnormality is debatable. Histology shows a compressed collagen sheath filled with a mucoid substance.# Rx:- A few resolve with aspiration or compression ('hitting with the family bible').- Surgery should be meticulous otherwise recurrence is likely.- Ganglia around the wrist should be traced down to their source, usually the scapholunate ligament and sometimes the scapho-trapezio-trapezioid joint. Educational Points:# Acute paronychia is the most common infection of the hand.# Superficial spreading melanomas are the most common (64 per cent) melanoma.# Nodular melanoma is the most malignant melanoma.",

Laboratory studies would most likely demonstrate serum autoantibodies directed against which of the following proteins?",

The clinical severity of the condition is variable, and symptoms tend to wax and wane. The other choices are not related to myasthenia gravis. Diagnosis: Myasthenia gravis",

Bacterial infections produce signs of acute inflammation with redness and swelling and tend not to involve nerves specifically. Some paraneoplastic syndromes may occur with carcinomas, such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, with weakness. Carcinomas are less likely at this age and are not frequent complications of HIV infection.
