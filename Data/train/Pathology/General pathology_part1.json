The diagnosis and management of many haematological diseases depends on examination of the bone marrow, which involves two separate specimens i. e. a cytologic and a histologic preparation. Bone marrow examination refers to the pathologic analysis of samples of bone marrow obtained by bone marrow biopsy (often called a trephine biopsy) and bone marrow aspiration. Bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, anemia, and pancytopenia. The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by phlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.",

        "exp": "Prostate cancers account for 43% of all cancers diagnosed in American men. It is estimated that in 1996, 317, 000 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed and 41, 000 men died of the disease. The challenge of treating prostate cancer lies in accurately distinguishing those histologically-localized cancers which will complete metastatic progression from those that will remain indolent. At this time, we lack appropriate histological markers to make such distinctions, therefore, it is often difficult to accurately predict the clinical course of an individual patient's disease. There is growing evidence that a critical event in the progression of a tumor cell from a non-metastatic to metastatic phenotype is the loss of function of metastasis-suppressor genes. These genes specifically suppress the ability of a cell to metastasize. Work from several groups has demonstrated that human chromosomes 8, 10, 11 and 17 encode prostate cancer metastasis suppressor activities. As a result of these effos the first prostate cancer metastasis-suppressor gene, KAI1, was identified and mapped to the p11-2 region of chromosome 11. In subsequent studies, an additional gene encoded by the same region, CD44 was also determined to have metastasis-suppressor activity. Recent studies have shown a correlation between decreased expression of KAI1 and CD44 and an increased malignant potential of prostate cancers. It is anticipated that the identification of other metastasis suppressor genes may allow for the development of diagnostic markers useful in the clinical substaging of individual tumors. This manuscript is intended to present our perspective on the impoance of these genes in the understanding of prostate cancer progression. More impoantly, we present new findings from our laboratory's effo to identify the metastasis-suppressor genes encoded by human chromosome 17. Specifically we repo the strategy currently being used to evaluate a series of candidate genes and the approach being utilized to pinpoint the metastasis-suppressor region on human chromosome 17.",

TLRs are located in plasma membranes and endosomes, so they are able to detect extracellular and ingested microbes. They are complemented by cytoplasmic and membrane molecules, from several other families, that also recognize microbial products. TLRs and the other receptors recognize products of different types of microbes and thus provide defense against essentially all classes of infectious pathogens. Recognition of microbes by these receptors activates transcription factors that stimulate the production of a number of secreted and membrane proteins. These proteins include mediators of inflammation, antiviral cytokines (interfer-ons), and proteins that promote lymphocyte activation and even more potent immune responses.

This disorder is encountered largely in persons of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. It is associated with widespread tissue involvement indistinguishable from reactive systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid fibril proteins are made up of AA proteins, suggesting that this form of amyloidosis is related to the recurrent bouts of inflammation that characterize this disease.

Reduced albumin synthesis occurs in the setting of severe liver disease (e. g., cirrhosis) and protein malnutrition. Regardless of cause, low albumin levels lead in a stepwise fashion to edema, reduced intravascular volume, renal hypoperfusion, and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Unfounately, increased salt and water retention by the kidney not only fails to correct the plasma volume deficit but also exacerbates the edema, since the primary defect--low serum protein--persists.

As the word malignant implies, it is a deadly disease that often has a poor prognosis. There are three primary types of mesothelioma: Malignant pleural mesothelioma - occurs in the lining of the lungs (pleura) Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma - occurs in the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) Malignant pericardial mesothelioma - occurs in the lining of the heart (pericardium). Asbestosis is a chronic inflammatory and scarring disease affecting the tissue of the lungs. People with the condition may experience severe shoness of breath and are at an increased risk for ceain cancers, including lung cancer and, less commonly, mesothelioma. Asbestosis specifically refers to fibrosis within the lung tissue from asbestos, and not scarring around the outside of the lungs. It is caused by the breathing in and retention of asbestos fibers. It usually occurs after high intensity and/or long-term exposure to asbestos (paicularly in those individuals working on the production or end-use of products containing asbestos) and is therefore regarded as an occupational lung disease. People with extensive occupational exposure to the mining, manufacturing, handling, or removal of asbestos are at risk of developing asbestosis.",

There has been ample evidence that Cdk2 is necessary for both DNA replication and centrosome duplication, which are both key events in S phase. It has also been shown that Cdk2 complexes with both cyclin A and cyclin E and this complex is critical for centrosome duplication. Three Cdk2 substrates have been proposed to be responsible for regulation of centriole duplication. These include: nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), CP110, and MPS1. Nucleophosmin is only found in unreplicated centrosomes and it's phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin E removes NPM from the centrosomes, initiating procentriole formation. CP110 is an impoant centrosomal protein that is phosphorylated by both mitotic and interphase Cdk/cyclin complexes and is thought to influence centrosome duplication in S phase. MPS1 is a protein kinase that is essential to the spindle assembly checkpoint, and may remodel an SAS6-cored intermediate between severed mother and daughter centrioles into a pair of cawheel protein complexes onto which procentrioles assembleS-phase (synthesis phase) is the pa of the cell cycle in which DNA is replicated, occurring between G1 phase and G2 phase.

This group of diseases is of great clinical interest because many of the new, rationally designed biologic therapies for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases have been developed to target abnormal T cell reactions. Two types of T cell reactions are capable of causing tissue injury and disease: (1) cytokine-mediated inflammation, in which the cytokines are produced mainly by CD4+ T cells, and (2) direct cell cytotoxicity, mediated by CD8+ T cells. In inflammation, exemplified by the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, CD4+ T cells of the TH1 and TH17 subsets secrete cytokines, which recruit and activate other cells, especially macrophages, and these are the major effector cells of injury. In cell-mediated cytotoxicity, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are responsible for tissue damage. Robbins 9 th edition page no. 118",

The use of banding techniques allows identification of each chromosome, and can detect and localize structural abnormalities. Karyotype analy- sis of chromosomes by G banding remains the classic approach for identifying changes at the chromosomal level; however, as might be expected, the resolution with this technique is fairly low. In order to identify subchromo- somal alterations, both focused analysis of chromosomal regions by FISH and global genomic approaches such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) have become popular. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) FISH utilizes DNA probes that recognize sequences spe- cific to chromosomal regions of greater than 100 kilobases in size, which defines the limit of resolution with this tech- nique for identifying chromosomal changes. Such probes are labeled with fluorescent dyes and applied to metaphase spreads or interphase nuclei. The probe hybridizes to its complementary sequence on the chromosome and thus labels the specific chromosomal region that can then be visualized under a fluorescence microscope. The ability of FISH to circumvent the need for dividing cells is invaluable when a rapid diagnosis is warranted (e. g., in a critically ill infant suspected of having an underlying genetic disorder). Such analysis can be performed on prenatal samples (e. g., cells obtained by amniocentesis, chorionic villus biopsy, or umbilical cord blood), peripheral blood lymphocytes, and even archival tissue sections. FISH has been used for detection of numeric abnormalities of chromosomes (aneuploidy) (Fig. 6-37, A); for the demonstration of subtle microdeletions (Fig. 6-37, B) or complex transloca- tions not detectable by routine karyotyping; for analysis of gene amplification (e. g., NMYC amplification in neuroblastomas); and for mapping newly isolated genes of interest to their chromosomal loci. Array-Based Genomic Hybridization It is obvious from the preceding discussion that FISH requires previous knowledge of the one or few specific chromosomal regions suspected of being altered in the test sample. However, chromosomal abnormalities may also be detected without previous knowledge of what these aber- rations may be, using a global strategy known as array- based CGH. Here the test DNA and a reference (normal) DNA are labeled with two different fluorescent dyes (most commonly, Cy5 and Cy3, which fluoresce red and green, respectively). The differentially labeled samples are then hybridized to an array of segments of genomic DNA \"spotted\" on a solid matrix, usually a glass slide (Fig. 6-38, A). These segments of DNA are representations of the human genome at regularly spaced intervals, and cover all 22 autosomes and the sex chromosome (Fig. 6-38, A). Amplifications and deletions in the test sample produce an increase or decrease in signal relative to the normal DNA that can be detected down to a 10-kilobase (kb) resolution (Fig. 6-38, B). Newer generations of microarrays using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (see fuher on) provide even higher resolution (with more than 1 million SNPs from the human genome on a single microarray!) and are currently being used to uncover copy number abnor- malities in a variety of diseases, from cancer to autism.

        "exp": "Antibody-mediated (type II) hypersensitivity disorders are caused by antibodies directed against target antigens on the surface of cells or other tissue components. The antigens may be normal molecules intrinsic to cell membranes or in the extracellular matrix, or they may be adsorbed exogenous antigens (e. g., a drug metabolite). Antibody-mediated abnormalities are the underlying cause of many human diseases;. In all of these disorders, the tissue damage or functional abnormalities result from a limited number of mechanisms. Mechanisms of Antibody-Mediated Diseases Antibodies cause disease by targeting cells for phagocytosis, by activating the complement system, and by interfering with normal cellular functions. The antibodies that are responsible typically are high-affinity antibodies capable of activating complement and binding to the Fc receptors of phagocytes. * Opsonization and phagocytosis. When circulating cells, such as erythrocytes or platelets, are coated (opsonized) with autoantibodies, with or without complement proteins, the cells become targets for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages. These phagocytes express receptors for the Fc tails of IgG antibodies and for breakdown products of the C3 complement protein, and use these receptors to bind and ingest opsonized paicles. Opsonized cells are usually eliminated in the spleen, and this is why splenectomy is of clinical benefit in autoimmune thrombocytopenia and some forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia.* Inflammation. Antibodies bound to cellular or tissue anti-gens activate the complement system by the \"classical\" pathway Products of complement activa-tion serve several functions, one of which is to recruit neutrophils and monocytes, triggering inflammation in tissues. Leukocytes may also be activated by engagement of Fc receptors, which rec-ognize the bound antibodies. This mechanism of injury is exemplified by Goodpasture syndrome and pemphi-gus vulgaris.* Antibody-mediated cellular dysfunction. In some cases, antibodies directed against cell surface receptors impair or dysregulate cellular function without causing cell injury or inflammation. In myasthenia gravis, antibodies against acetylcholine receptors in the motor end plates of skeletal muscles inhibit neuromuscular transmission, with resultant muscle weakness. Antibodies can also stimulate cellular responses excessively. In Graves disease, antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor stim-ulate thyroid epithelial cells to secrete thyroid hormones, resulting in hypehyroidism. Antibodies against hor-mones and other essential proteins can neutralize and block the actions of these molecules, causing functional derangements. Robbins 9 th edition page no. 114",

Throat cancer can develop in different areas. The term throat cancer covers the area called the pharynx and the larynx (voicebox). The pharynx is divided into three main pas; the nasopharynx, the oropharynx and the hypopharynx. The larynx is in front of the hypopharynx. Cancers of the thyroid, oesophagus (gullet) or wind pipe (trachea), near to the throat, are treated differently. Most head and neck cancers sta in the cells that line the mouth, nose and throat.

RB Gene: Governor of the Cell Cycle It is useful to begin with the retinoblastoma gene (RB), the first tumor suppressor gene to be discovered and, as it happens, a prototypical representative. As with many advances in medicine, the discovery of tumor suppressor genes was accomplished by the study of a rare disease--in this case, retinoblastoma, an uncommon childhood tumor. Approximately 60% of retinoblastomas are sporadic, and the remaining ones are familial, the predisposition to develop the tumor being transmitted as an autosomal dom- inant trait. To account for the sporadic and familial occur- rence of an identical tumor, Knudson, in 1974, proposed his now famous two-hit hypothesis, which in molecular terms can be stated as follows: * Two mutations (hits) are required to produce retinoblas- toma. These involve the RB gene, which has been mapped to chromosomal locus 13q14. Both of the normal alleles of the RB locus must be inactivated (hence the two hits) for the development of retinoblastoma (Fig. 5-21). * In familial cases, children inherit one defective copy of the RB gene in the germ line; the other copy is normal. Retinoblastoma develops when the normal RB gene is lost in retinoblasts as a result of somatic mutation. Because in retinoblastoma families only a single somatic mutation is required for expression of the disease, the familial transmission follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. * In sporadic cases, both normal RB alleles are lost by somatic mutation in one of the retinoblasts. The end result is the same: a retinal cell that has lost both of the normal copies of the RB gene becomes cancerous. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 183",

The main symptoms of Behcet's disease include: genital and mouth ulcers red, painful eyes and blurred vision acne-like spots headaches painful, stiff and swollen joints In severe cases, there's also a risk of serious and potentially life-threatening problems, such as permanent vision loss and strokes.

        "exp": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases that affects white populations (1/2000). The primary abnormality in patients with cystic fibrosis involves the epithelial transpo of chloride. Normally, binding of a ligand to a membrane surface receptor activates adenyl cyclase, which leads to increased intracellular c. AMP. This in turn activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), causing it to open and release chloride ions. Sodium ions and water then follow the chloride ions to maintain the normal viscosity of mucus. The most common abnormality in patients with CF involves decreased glycosylation of the CFTR, which then does not become incorporated into the cell membrane. A lack of chloride channels then causes decreased chloride, sodium, and water secretion, all of which together results in a very thick mucus (the other name of CF is mucoviscidosis). These thick mucus plugs can block the pancreatic ducts, causing fibrosis and cystic dilation of the ducts (hence the name cystic fibrosis). Decreased excretion of pancreatic lipase leads to malabsorption of fat and steatorrhea, which may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. Thick mucus may also cause intestinal obstruction in neonates, a condition called meconium ileus. Abnormal mucus in the pulmonary tree leads to atelectasis, fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and recurrent pulmonary infections, especially with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas species. Obstruction of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles in males leads to sterility, while obstruction of the bile duct produces jaundice.

Because MHC molecules are fundamental to the recognition of antigens by T cells and are linked to many autoimmune diseases. In humans the MHC molecules are called human leukocyte antigens (HLA). On the basis of their structure, cellular distribution and function, MHC gene products are classified into two major classes: * Class I MHC molecules- expressed on all nucleated cells and platelets. They are heterodimers consisting of a polymorphic a, or heavy, chain linked non-covalently to a smaller non polymorphic protein called b 2 -microglobulin. Class I MHC molecules display peptides that are derived from proteins, such as viral and tumor antigens, that are located in the cytoplasm and usually produced in the cell, and class I-associated peptides are recognized by CD8+ T lymphocytes. Since CD8+ T cells recognize peptides only if presented as a complex with class I MHC molecules, CD8+ T cells are said to be class I MHC-restricted. * Class II MHC molecules- encoded in a region called HLA-D, which has three subregions: HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR. Class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of a noncovalently associated a chain and b chain, both of which are polymorphic. Class II MHC molecules present antigens that are internalized into vesicles, and are typically derived from extracellular microbes and soluble proteins. The class II b 2 domain has a binding site for CD4, and therefore, the class II-peptide complex is recognized by CD4+ T cells. Because CD4+ T cells can recognize antigens only in the context of self-class II molecules, they are referred to as class II MHC-restricted.

They are a nonspecific finding and can be found in patients with several diseases other than alcoholic hepatitis, such as Wilson's disease, and in patients who have undergone bypass operations for morbid obesity Immunoglobulins may form intracytoplasmic or extracellular oval hyaline bodies called Russell bodies. Excess plasma proteins may form hyaline droplets in proximal renal tubular epithelial cells or hyaline membranes in the alveoli of the lungs (hyaline membrane disease). The hyalin found in the walls of aerioles of kidneys in patients with benign nephrosclerosis is composed of basement membranes and precipitated plasma proteins.

In some cases, the tumors are malignant, in others, benign. Benign or malignant tumors of nonendocrine tissues occur as components of some of these tumor syndromes. MEN syndromes are inherited as autosomal dominant disorders. A tumor suppressor gene, or antioncogene, is a gene that protects a cell from one step on the path to cancer. When this gene mutates to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic changes. The loss of these genes may be even more impoant than proto-oncogene/oncogene activation for the formation of many kinds of human cancer cells.",

A slower and more prolonged retraction of endothelial cells, resulting from changes in the cytoskeleton, may be induced by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1).

NETs, PETs, or PNETs), often referred to as \"islet cell tumors\", or \"pancreatic endocrine tumors\" are neuroendocrine neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous system within the pancreas. Pan. NETs are a type of neuroendocrine tumor, representing about one third of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Many Pan. NETs are benign, while some are malignant. Aggressive Pan. NET tumors have traditionally been termed \"islet cell carcinoma\". Pan. NETs are quite distinct from the usual form of pancreatic cancer, the majority of which are adenocarcinomas, which arises in the exocrine pancreas. Only 1 or 2% of clinically significant pancreas neoplasms are Pan. NETs. In the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastrin is produced at excessive levels, often by a gastrinoma (gastrin-producing tumor, mostly benign) of the duodenum or the pancreas. To investigate for hypergastrinemia (high blood levels of gastrin), a \"pentagastrin test\" can be performed. In autoimmune gastritis, the immune system attacks the parietal cells leading to hypochlorhydria (low stomach acidity). This results in an elevated gastrin level in an attempt to compensate for increased pH in the stomach. Eventually, all the parietal cells are lost and achlorhydria results leading to a loss of negative feedback on gastrin secretion. Plasma gastrin concentration is elevated in viually all individuals with mucolipidosis type IV (mean 1507 pg/mL; range 400-4100 pg/mL) (normal 0-200 pg/mL) secondary to a constitutive achlorhydria. This finding facilitates the diagnosis of patients with this neurogenetic disorder. Additionally, elevated gastrin levels may be present in chronic gastritis resulting from H pylori infection.",

        "exp": "The hallmark of irreversible cell injury is a loss of integrity of cell membrane and lysosomal membranes Myelin figures are phospholipid deposits formed as a result of cell membrane integrity loss; Seen in the very late phase of reversible injury and irreversible injury. Necrosis Necrosis is the type of cell death that is associated with loss of membrane integrity and leakage of cellular contents cul- minating in dissolution of cells, largely resulting from the degradative action of enzymes on lethally injured cells. The leaked cellular contents often elicit a local host reaction, called inflammation, that attempts to eliminate the dead cells and sta the subsequent repair process (Chapter 2). The enzymes responsible for digestion of the cell may be derived from the lysosomes of the dying cells themselves and from the lysosomes of leukocytes that are recruited as pa of the inflammatory reaction to the dead cells. MORPHOLOGY Necrosis is characterized by changes in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the injured cells (Figs. 1-6, left, and 1-8, C). * Cytoplasmic changes. Necrotic cells show increased eosinophilia (i. e., pink staining from the eosin dye--the E in the hematoxylin and eosin stain), attributable in pa to increased binding of eosin to denatured cyto- plasmic proteins and in pa to loss of the basophilia that is normally impaed by the ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the cytoplasm (basophilia is the blue staining from the hema- toxylin dye--the H in \"H&E\"). Compared with ble cells, the cell may have a more glassy, homogeneous appear- ance, mostly because of the loss of glycogen paicles. Myelin figures are more prominent in necrotic cells than during reversible injury. When enzymes have digested cytoplasmic organelles, the cytoplasm becomes vacuo- lated and appears \"moth-eaten. \" By electron microscopy, necrotic cells are characterized by discontinuities in plasma and organelle membranes, marked dilation of mitochon- dria with the appearance of large amorphous densities, disruption of lysosomes, and intracytoplasmic myelin figures. * Nuclear changes. Nuclear changes assume one of three patterns, all due to breakdown of DNA and chromatin. The basophilia of the chromatin may fade (karyolysis), presumably secondary to deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activity. A second pattern is pyknosis, characterized by nuclear shrinkage and increased basophilia; the DNA con- denses into a solid shrunken mass. In the third pattern, karyorrhexis, the pyknotic nucleus undergoes fragmen- tation. In 1 to 2 days, the nucleus in a dead cell may completely disappear. Electron microscopy reveals pro- found nuclear changes culminating in nuclear dissolution. * Fates of necrotic cells. Necrotic cells may persist for some time or may be digested by enzymes and disappear. Dead cells may be replaced by myelin figures, which are either phagocytosed by other cells or fuher degraded into fatty acids. These fatty acids bind calcium salts, which may result in the dead cells ultimately becoming calcified. Refer robbins 9/e p834",

Pathogenic immune complexes may form in the circulation and subsequently deposit in blood vessels, or the complexes may form at sites where antigen has been planted (in situ immune complexes).

There are also nonenzymatic and enzymatic systems that contribute to inactivation of free radicals. * The rate of decay of superoxide is significantly increased by the action of superoxide dismutases (SODs) found in many cell types. Glutathione (GSH) peroxidases are a family of enzymes whose major function is to protect cells from oxidative damage. The most abundant member of this family, glutathione peroxidase 1, is found in the cytoplasm of all cells. It catalyzes the breakdown of H2. O2 by the reaction 2 GSH (glutathione) + H2. O2 - GS-SG + 2 H2O. The intracellular ratio of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH) is a reflection of this enzyme's activity and thus of the cell's ability to catabolize free radicals. * Catalase, present in peroxisomes, catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (2. H2. O2 - O2 + 2. H2O). It is one of the most active enzymes known, capable of degrading millions of molecules of H2. O2 per second. * Endogenous or exogenous antioxidants (e. g., vitamins E, A, and C and b-carotene) may either block the formation of free radicals or scavenge them once they have formed.

        "exp": "Abnormalities of the hepatic blood flow occur in various disease states and result in characteristic symptoms. Because of their dual blood supply, aerial occlusion of either the hepatic aery or the poal vein rarely results in liver infarcts. However, thrombosis of branches of the hepatic aery may result in a pale (anemic) infarct, or possibly a hemorrhagic infarct due to blood flow from the poal vein. In contrast, occlusion of the poal vein, which may be caused by cirrhosis or malignancy, may result in a wedge-shaped red area called an infarct of Zahn. This is a misnomer, however, since it is not really an infarction but instead is the result of focal sinusoidal congestion. Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome) is associated with polycythemia vera, pregnancy, and oral contraceptives. Clinically, Budd-Chiari syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, ascites, tender hepatomegaly, and hematemesis. Occlusion of the central veins, called venoocclusive disease, may be rarely seen in Jamaican drinkers of alkaloid-containing bush tea, but is much more commonly found following bone marrow transplantation (up to 25% of allogenic marrow transplants).

It can also be regarded as one of the earliest structural changes observed in the cell. The GTP-binding protein Rac is the regulator of this membrane ruffling. Changes in the Polyphosphoinositide metabolism and changes in the Ca2+ level of the cell may also play an impoant role. A number of actin-binding and organizing proteins localize to membrane ruffles and potentially target to transducing molecules. The characteristic feature of migrating cells Membrane Ruffling is a characteristic feature of many actively migrating cells. When the membrane is unable to attach to the substrate, the membrane protrusion is recycled back into the cell. The ruffling of membranes is thought to be controlled by a group of enzymes known as Rho GTPases, specifically RhoA, Rac1, and cdc42. Robbins 9th edition page no. 29",

In glioblastoma, variation in the gross appearance of the tumor from region to region is characteristic (Fig. 22-28, B). Some areas are firm and white, others are soft and yellow (the result of tissue necrosis), and still others show regions of cystic degeneration and hemorrhage. Well-differentiated astrocytomas are characterized by a mild to moderate increase in the number of glial cell nuclei, somewhat variable nuclear pleomorphism, and an intervening feltwork of fine, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytic cell processes that give the background a fibrillary appearance.

This ability makes NK cells an early line of defense against viral infections and, some tumors. Two cell surface molecules, CD16 and CD56, are commonly used to identify NK cells. CD16 is an Fc receptor for IgG, and it confers on NK cells the ability to lyse IgG-coated target cells. This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Often the forehead is narrow, hands and feet small, height sho, skin light in color, and they are unable to have children. About 70% of cases occur when pa of the father's chromosome 15 is deleted.

The activation of caspases depends on a finely tuned balance between production of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. Two distinct pathways converge on caspase activation: the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway pro-apoptotic members of the family called Bax and Bak, which dimerize, inse into the mito- chondrial membrane, and form channels through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins escape into the cytosol. These sensors also inhibit the anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (see fuher on), enhancing the leakage of mitochondrial proteins. Cytochrome c, together with some cofactors, activates caspase-9. Other proteins that leak out of mitochondria block the activities of caspase antagonists that function as physiologic inhibitors of apop- tosis. The net result is the activation of the caspase cascade, ultimately leading to nuclear fragmentation. Conversely, if cells are exposed to growth factors and other survival signals, they synthesize anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, the two main ones of which are Bcl-2 itself and Bcl-xL. These proteins antagonize Bax and Bak, and thus limit the escape of the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins. Cells deprived of growth factors not only activate the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak but also show reduced levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, thus fuher tilting the balance toward death. ref Robbins 9/e p19",

Literature suggests that the only known risk factor for extragonadal germ cell tumors (EGCTs) is Klinefelter syndrome (47. XXY), which is associated with mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. They are characterized by their location on the midline from the pineal gland to the coccyx. In extragonadal germ cell tumors, no evidence of a primary malignancy is present in either the testes or ovaries by radiologic imaging or physical examination. Extragonadal germ cell tumors produce a rich symptomatology and may reach large volumes if they arise in silent areas. Histologically, they mirror their gonadal counterpas with which they share the same chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity. Modern approaches to diagnosis and treatment can result in high rates of long-term survival and even cureA number of different types of germ cell tumours can develop in the mediastinum. These are much more common in males than females. They are generally put into 2 main groups Non seminoma germ cell tumours (in females these are called non dysgerminomas) - including teratomas, choriocarcinomas, embryonal carcinomas and yolk sac tumours Seminomas (in females these are called dysgerminomas) Some teratomas can be non cancerous (benign).
