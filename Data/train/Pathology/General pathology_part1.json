Bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, anemia, and pancytopenia. The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by phlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.",

Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder inherited from a person's parents. It is due to mutations in the PAH gene which results in low levels of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This results in the build up of dietary phenylalanine to potentially toxic levels. It is autosomal recessive meaning that both copies of the gene must be mutated for the condition to develop. There are two main types, classic PKU and variant PKU, depending on if any enzyme function remains. Those with one copy of a mutated gene typically do not have symptoms",

Proto-oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals, usually through their protein products. Upon acquiring an activating mutation, a proto-oncogene becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene. Examples of proto-oncogenes include RAS, WNT, MYC, ERK, and TRK. The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt's Lymphoma, which stas when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence within the vicinity of the MYC gene. The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors. When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed, these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates. Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr-Abl gene found on the Philadelphia Chromosome, a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22.

        "question": "Which of the following is a metastasis suppressor gene in relation to prostate cancer",
        "exp": "Prostate cancers account for 43% of all cancers diagnosed in American men. It is estimated that in 1996, 317,000 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed and 41,000 men died of the disease. The challenge of treating prostate cancer lies in accurately distinguishing those histologically-localized cancers which will complete metastatic progression from those that will remain indolent. At this time, we lack appropriate histological markers to make such distinctions, therefore, it is often difficult to accurately predict the clinical course of an individual patient's disease. There is growing evidence that a critical event in the progression of a tumor cell from a non-metastatic to metastatic phenotype is the loss of function of metastasis-suppressor genes. These genes specifically suppress the ability of a cell to metastasize. Work from several groups has demonstrated that human chromosomes 8, 10, 11 and 17 encode prostate cancer metastasis suppressor activities. As a result of these effos the first prostate cancer metastasis-suppressor gene, KAI1, was identified and mapped to the p11-2 region of chromosome 11. In subsequent studies, an additional gene encoded by the same region, CD44 was also determined to have metastasis-suppressor activity. Recent studies have shown a correlation between decreased expression of KAI1 and CD44 and an increased malignant potential of prostate cancers. It is anticipated that the identification of other metastasis suppressor genes may allow for the development of diagnostic markers useful in the clinical substaging of individual tumors. This manuscript is intended to present our perspective on the impoance of these genes in the understanding of prostate cancer progression. More impoantly, we present new findings from our laboratory's effo to identify the metastasis-suppressor genes encoded by human chromosome 17. Specifically we repo the strategy currently being used to evaluate a series of candidate genes and the approach being utilized to pinpoint the metastasis-suppressor region on human chromosome 17.",

There are ten mammalian TLRs, which recognize products of bacteria (such as endotoxin and bacterial DNA), viruses (such as double-stranded RNA), and other pathogens . TLRs are located in plasma membranes and endosomes, so they are able to detect extracellular and ingested microbes. They are complemented by cytoplasmic and membrane molecules, from several other families, that also recognize microbial products. TLRs and the other receptors recognize products of different types of microbes and thus provide defense against essentially all classes of infectious pathogens. Recognition of microbes by these receptors activates transcription factors that stimulate the production of a number of secreted and membrane proteins. These proteins include mediators of inflammation, antiviral cytokines (interfer-ons), and proteins that promote lymphocyte activation and even more potent immune responses.

Reduced albumin synthesis occurs in the setting of severe liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis) and protein malnutrition . Regardless of cause, low albumin levels lead in a stepwise fashion to edema, reduced intravascular volume, renal hypoperfusion, and secondary hyperaldosteronism.

As of 2014, there are about 150 imprinted genes known in the mouse and about half that in humans. Genomic imprinting is an inheritance process independent of the classical Mendelian inheritance. It is an epigenetic process that involves DNA methylation and histone methylation without altering the genetic sequence. These epigenetic marks are established (\"imprinted\") in the germline (sperm or egg cells) of the parents and are maintained through mitotic cell divisions in the somatic cells of an organism.

The occurrence and significance of T lymphocyte-mediated tissue injury have been increasingly appreciated as the methods for detecting and purifying T cells from patients' circulation and lesions have improved. This group of diseases is of great clinical interest because many of the new, rationally designed biologic therapies for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases have been developed to target abnormal T cell reactions. Two types of T cell reactions are capable of causing tissue injury and disease: (1) cytokine-mediated inflammation, in which the cytokines are produced mainly by CD4+ T cells, and (2) direct cell cytotoxicity, mediated by CD8+ T cells . In inflammation, exemplified by the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, CD4+ T cells of the TH1 and TH17 subsets secrete cytokines, which recruit and activate other cells, especially macrophages, and these are the major effector cells of injury. In cell-mediated cytotoxicity, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are responsible for tissue damage. Robbins 9 th edition page no. 118",

The pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK are directly promoting mitochondrial permeabilization. Their action is inhibited by the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and BCL-XL. The third set of proteins, the so-called BH3-only proteins, which include BAD, BID, and PUMA, regulate the balance between the pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family.The BH3-only proteins promote apoptosis by neutralizing the actions of anti-apoptotic proteins like BCL2 and BCL-XL. When the sum total of all BH3 proteins expressed \"overwhelms\" the anti-apoptotic BCL2/ BCLXL protein barrier, BAX and BAK are activated and form pores in the mitochondrial membrane. Cytochrome c leaks into the cytosol, where it binds to APAF-1 and activates caspase-9. Like caspase-8 of the extrinsic pathway, caspase-9 can cleave and activate the executioner caspases.

Biopsy and subsequent Congo red staining is the most impoant tool in the diagnosis of amyloidosis. In general, biopsy is taken from the organ suspected to be involved. For example, renal biopsy is useful in the presence of urinary abnormalities. Rectal and gingival biopsy specimens contain amyloid in as many as 75% of cases with generalized amyloidosis. Examination of abdominal fat aspirates stained with Congo red is a simple, low-risk method. In suspected cases of AL amyloidosis, serum and urinary protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis should be performed. Bone marrow examination in such cases usually shows plasmacytosis, even if skeletal lesions of multiple myeloma are not present. Proteomic analysis of affected tissue is now being widely used for detection of small amounts of amyloid (from fat aspirates) and for definitive identification of the type of amyloid.

        "question": "Karyotyping is useful in diagnosis of-",
        "exp": "A karyotype is a photographic representation of a stained metaphase spread in which the chromosomes are arranged in order of decreasing length.A variety of techniques for staining chromosomes have been developed. With the widely used Giemsa stain (G banding) technique, each chromosome set can be seen to possess a distinctive pattern of alternating light and dark bands of variable widths . The use of banding techniques allows identification of each chromosome, and can detect and localize structural abnormalities. Karyotype analy- sis of chromosomes by G banding remains the classic approach for identifying changes at the chromosomal level; however, as might be expected, the resolution with this technique is fairly low. In order to identify subchromo- somal alterations, both focused analysis of chromosomal regions by FISH and global genomic approaches such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) have become popular. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) FISH utilizes DNA probes that recognize sequences spe- cific to chromosomal regions of greater than 100 kilobases in size, which defines the limit of resolution with this tech- nique for identifying chromosomal changes. Such probes are labeled with fluorescent dyes and applied to metaphase spreads or interphase nuclei. The probe hybridizes to its complementary sequence on the chromosome and thus labels the specific chromosomal region that can then be visualized under a fluorescence microscope. The ability of FISH to circumvent the need for dividing cells is invaluable when a rapid diagnosis is warranted (e.g., in a critically ill infant suspected of having an underlying genetic disorder). Such analysis can be performed on prenatal samples (e.g., cells obtained by amniocentesis, chorionic villus biopsy, or umbilical cord blood), peripheral blood lymphocytes, and even archival tissue sections. FISH has been used for detection of numeric abnormalities of chromosomes (aneuploidy) (Fig. 6-37, A); for the demonstration of subtle microdeletions (Fig. 6-37, B) or complex transloca- tions not detectable by routine karyotyping; for analysis of gene amplification (e.g., NMYC amplification in neuroblastomas); and for mapping newly isolated genes of interest to their chromosomal loci. Array-Based Genomic Hybridization It is obvious from the preceding discussion that FISH requires previous knowledge of the one or few specific chromosomal regions suspected of being altered in the test sample. However, chromosomal abnormalities may also be detected without previous knowledge of what these aber- rations may be, using a global strategy known as array- based CGH. Here the test DNA and a reference (normal) DNA are labeled with two different fluorescent dyes (most commonly, Cy5 and Cy3, which fluoresce red and green, respectively). The differentially labeled samples are then hybridized to an array of segments of genomic DNA \"spotted\" on a solid matrix, usually a glass slide (Fig. 6-38, A). These segments of DNA are representations of the human genome at regularly spaced intervals, and cover all 22 autosomes and the sex chromosome (Fig. 6-38, A). Amplifications and deletions in the test sample produce an increase or decrease in signal relative to the normal DNA that can be detected down to a 10-kilobase (kb) resolution (Fig. 6-38, B). Newer generations of microarrays using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (see fuher on) provide even higher resolution (with more than 1 million SNPs from the human genome on a single microarray!) and are currently being used to uncover copy number abnor- malities in a variety of diseases, from cancer to autism.

The antigens may be normal molecules intrinsic to cell membranes or in the extracellular matrix, or they may be adsorbed exogenous antigens (e.g., a drug metabolite). Antibody-mediated abnormalities are the underlying cause of many human diseases; . In all of these disorders, the tissue damage or functional abnormalities result from a limited number of mechanisms. Mechanisms of Antibody-Mediated Diseases Antibodies cause disease by targeting cells for phagocytosis, by activating the complement system, and by interfering with normal cellular functions . The antibodies that are responsible typically are high-affinity antibodies capable of activating complement and binding to the Fc receptors of phagocytes. * Opsonization and phagocytosis. When circulating cells, such as erythrocytes or platelets, are coated (opsonized) with autoantibodies, with or without complement proteins, the cells become targets for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages . These phagocytes express receptors for the Fc tails of IgG antibodies and for breakdown products of the C3 complement protein, and use these receptors to bind and ingest opsonized paicles. Opsonized cells are usually eliminated in the spleen, and this is why splenectomy is of clinical benefit in autoimmune thrombocytopenia and some forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia.* Inflammation. Antibodies bound to cellular or tissue anti-gens activate the complement system by the \"classical\" pathway Products of complement activa-tion serve several functions , one of which is to recruit neutrophils and monocytes, triggering inflammation in tissues. Leukocytes may also be activated by engagement of Fc receptors, which rec-ognize the bound antibodies. This mechanism of injury is exemplified by Goodpasture syndrome and pemphi-gus vulgaris.* Antibody-mediated cellular dysfunction. In some cases, antibodies directed against cell surface receptors impair or dysregulate cellular function without causing cell injury or inflammation . In myasthenia gravis, antibodies against acetylcholine receptors in the motor end plates of skeletal muscles inhibit neuromuscular transmission, with resultant muscle weakness. Antibodies can also stimulate cellular responses excessively. In Graves disease, antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor stim-ulate thyroid epithelial cells to secrete thyroid hormones, resulting in hypehyroidism. Antibodies against hor-mones and other essential proteins can neutralize and block the actions of these molecules, causing functional derangements. Robbins 9 th edition page no. 114",

Throat cancer can develop in different areas. The term throat cancer covers the area called the pharynx and the larynx (voicebox). The pharynx is divided into three main pas; the nasopharynx, the oropharynx and the hypopharynx. The larynx is in front of the hypopharynx. Cancers of the thyroid, oesophagus (gullet) or wind pipe (trachea), near to the throat, are treated differently. Most head and neck cancers sta in the cells that line the mouth, nose and throat.

SAA is synthesized by liver cells under the influence of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 that are produced during inflammation; thus, long-standing inflammation leads to elevated SAA levels, and ultimately the AA form of amyloid deposits. However, increased production of SAA by itself is not sufficient for the deposition of amyloid. Elevation of serum SAA levels is common to inflammatory states but in most instances does not lead to amyloidosis. There are two possible explanations for this. According to one view, SAA normally is degraded to soluble end products by the action of monocyte-derived enzymes. Conceivably, people who develop amyloidosis have an enzyme defect that results in incomplete breakdown of SAA, thus generating insoluble AA molecules. Alternatively, a genetically determined structural abnormality in the SAA molecule itself renders it resistant to degradation by macrophages . Robbins 9 th edition page no. 153",

RB Gene: Governor of the Cell Cycle It is useful to begin with the retinoblastoma gene (RB), the first tumor suppressor gene to be discovered and, as it happens, a prototypical representative. As with many advances in medicine, the discovery of tumor suppressor genes was accomplished by the study of a rare disease--in this case, retinoblastoma, an uncommon childhood tumor. Approximately 60% of retinoblastomas are sporadic, and the remaining ones are familial, the predisposition to develop the tumor being transmitted as an autosomal dom- inant trait. To account for the sporadic and familial occur- rence of an identical tumor, Knudson, in 1974, proposed his now famous two-hit hypothesis, which in molecular terms can be stated as follows: * Two mutations (hits) are required to produce retinoblas- toma. These involve the RB gene, which has been mapped to chromosomal locus 13q14. Both of the normal alleles of the RB locus must be inactivated (hence the two hits) for the development of retinoblastoma (Fig. 5-21). * In familial cases, children inherit one defective copy of the RB gene in the germ line; the other copy is normal. Retinoblastoma develops when the normal RB gene is lost in retinoblasts as a result of somatic mutation. Because in retinoblastoma families only a single somatic mutation is required for expression of the disease, the familial transmission follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. * In sporadic cases, both normal RB alleles are lost by somatic mutation in one of the retinoblasts. The end result is the same: a retinal cell that has lost both of the normal copies of the RB gene becomes cancerous. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 183",

Sodium ions and water then follow the chloride ions to maintain the normal viscosity of mucus. The most common abnormality in patients with CF involves decreased glycosylation of the CFTR, which then does not become incorporated into the cell membrane. A lack of chloride channels then causes decreased chloride, sodium, and water secretion, all of which together results in a very thick mucus (the other name of CF is mucoviscidosis). These thick mucus plugs can block the pancreatic ducts, causing fibrosis and cystic dilation of the ducts (hence the name cystic fibrosis). Decreased excretion of pancreatic lipase leads to malabsorption of fat and steatorrhea, which may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. Thick mucus may also cause intestinal obstruction in neonates, a condition called meconium ileus. Abnormal mucus in the pulmonary tree leads to atelectasis, fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and recurrent pulmonary infections, especially with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas species. Obstruction of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles in males leads to sterility, while obstruction of the bile duct produces jaundice.

PanNETs are a type of neuroendocrine tumor, representing about one third of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Many PanNETs are benign, while some are malignant. Aggressive PanNET tumors have traditionally been termed \"islet cell carcinoma\". PanNETs are quite distinct from the usual form of pancreatic cancer, the majority of which are adenocarcinomas, which arises in the exocrine pancreas. Only 1 or 2% of clinically significant pancreas neoplasms are PanNETs.In the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastrin is produced at excessive levels, often by a gastrinoma (gastrin-producing tumor, mostly benign) of the duodenum or the pancreas. To investigate for hypergastrinemia (high blood levels of gastrin), a \"pentagastrin test\" can be performed. In autoimmune gastritis, the immune system attacks the parietal cells leading to hypochlorhydria (low stomach acidity). This results in an elevated gastrin level in an attempt to compensate for increased pH in the stomach. Eventually, all the parietal cells are lost and achlorhydria results leading to a loss of negative feedback on gastrin secretion. Plasma gastrin concentration is elevated in viually all individuals with mucolipidosis type IV (mean 1507 pg/mL; range 400-4100 pg/mL) (normal 0-200 pg/mL) secondary to a constitutive achlorhydria.

        "exp": "The hallmark of irreversible cell injury is a loss of integrity of cell membrane and lysosomal membranes Myelin figures are phospholipid deposits formed as a result of cell membrane integrity loss; Seen in the very late phase of reversible injury and irreversible injury. Necrosis Necrosis is the type of cell death that is associated with loss of membrane integrity and leakage of cellular contents cul- minating in dissolution of cells, largely resulting from the degradative action of enzymes on lethally injured cells. The leaked cellular contents often elicit a local host reaction, called inflammation, that attempts to eliminate the dead cells and sta the subsequent repair process (Chapter 2). The enzymes responsible for digestion of the cell may be derived from the lysosomes of the dying cells themselves and from the lysosomes of leukocytes that are recruited as pa of the inflammatory reaction to the dead cells. MORPHOLOGY Necrosis is characterized by changes in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the injured cells (Figs. 1-6, left, and 1-8, C). * Cytoplasmic changes. Necrotic cells show increased eosinophilia (i.e., pink staining from the eosin dye--the E in the hematoxylin and eosin stain), attributable in pa to increased binding of eosin to denatured cyto- plasmic proteins and in pa to loss of the basophilia that is normally impaed by the ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the cytoplasm (basophilia is the blue staining from the hema- toxylin dye--the H in \"H&E\"). Compared with ble cells, the cell may have a more glassy, homogeneous appear- ance, mostly because of the loss of glycogen paicles. Myelin figures are more prominent in necrotic cells than during reversible injury. When enzymes have digested cytoplasmic organelles, the cytoplasm becomes vacuo- lated and appears \"moth-eaten.\" By electron microscopy, necrotic cells are characterized by discontinuities in plasma and organelle membranes, marked dilation of mitochon- dria with the appearance of large amorphous densities, disruption of lysosomes, and intracytoplasmic myelin figures. * Nuclear changes. Nuclear changes assume one of three patterns, all due to breakdown of DNA and chromatin. The basophilia of the chromatin may fade (karyolysis), presumably secondary to deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activity. A second pattern is pyknosis, characterized by nuclear shrinkage and increased basophilia; the DNA con- denses into a solid shrunken mass. In the third pattern, karyorrhexis, the pyknotic nucleus undergoes fragmen- tation. In 1 to 2 days, the nucleus in a dead cell may completely disappear. Electron microscopy reveals pro- found nuclear changes culminating in nuclear dissolution. * Fates of necrotic cells. Necrotic cells may persist for some time or may be digested by enzymes and disappear. Dead cells may be replaced by myelin figures, which are either phagocytosed by other cells or fuher degraded into fatty acids. These fatty acids bind calcium salts, which may result in the dead cells ultimately becoming calcified. Refer robbins 9/e p834",

Encoded by eukaryotic nuclear DNA in plants and animals and by viral DNA in ceain viruses whose genome is based on DNA, miRNAs function base-pairing with complementary sequences within mRNA molecules. As a result, these mRNA molecules are silenced, by one or more of the following processes: Cleavage of the mRNA strand into two pieces, Destabilization of the mRNA through shoening of its poly(A) tail, and Less efficient translation of the mRNA into proteins by ribosomes. miRNAs resemble the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, except miRNAs derive from regions of RNA transcripts that fold back on themselves to form sho hairpins, whereas siRNAs derive from longer regions of double-stranded RNA.

The clinical features include small hands and feet and a deceleration of the rate of head growth (including microcephaly in some). Repetitive stereotyped hand movements, such as wringing and/or repeatedly putting hands into the mouth, are also noted. People with Rett syndrome are prone to gastrointestinal disorders and up to 80% have seizures. They typically have no verbal skills, and about 50% of affected individuals do not walk. Scoliosis, growth failure, and constipation are very common and can be problematic. The signs of this disorder are most easily confused with those of Angelman syndrome, cerebral palsy and autism. Rett syndrome occurs in approximately 1:10,000 live female bihs in all geographies, and across all ethnicities. The syndrome was first described by Austrian neurologist Andreas Rett in 1966. While the disorder was identified scientifically, and could be reliably diagnosed, the causes remained unknown for decades.

As is well known, they can give rise to all blood cell lineages and continuously replenish the formed ele- ments of the blood as these are consumed in the periphery. In clinical practice, marrow stem cells are used for treat- ment of diseases such as leukemia and lymphomas (Chapter 11). In addition to hematopoietic stem cells, the bone marrow also contains a somewhat distinctive population of tissue stem cells, often called mesenchymal stem cells. These cells can give rise to a variety of mesenchymal cells, such as chondroblasts, osteoblasts, and myoblasts. Hence, there is great interest in their therapeutic potential Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) are the most undifferenti- ated stem cells. They are present in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst and have extensive cell renewal capac- ity. Hence they can be maintained in culture for over a year without differentiating.

It is the most common malignant cancer of the eye in children, and it is almost exclusively found in young children. Though most children survive this cancer, they may lose their vision in the affected eye(s) or need to have the eye removed. Almost half of children with retinoblastoma have a hereditary genetic defect associated with retinoblastoma. In other cases, it is caused by a congenital mutation in the chromosome 13 gene, Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a gross chromosomal event that results in loss of the entire gene and the surrounding chromosomal region. Most diploid cells, for example human somatic cells, contain two copies of the genome, one from each parent (chromosome pair); each copy contains approximately 3 billion bases (adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) or thymine (T)). For the majority of positions in the genome the base present is consistent between individuals, however a small percentage may contain different bases (usually one of two; for instance, 'A' or 'G') and these positions are called 'single nucleotide polymorphisms' or 'SNPs'. When the genomic copies derived from each parent have different bases for these polymorphic regions (SNPs) the region is said to be heterozygous. Most of the chromosomes within somatic cells of individuals are paired, allowing for SNP locations to be potentially heterozygous. However, one parental copy of a region can sometimes be lost, which results in the region having just one copy. The single copy cannot be heterozygous at SNP locations and therefore the region shows loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Loss of heterozygosity due to loss of one parental copy in a region is also called hemizygosity in that region.",

There are also nonenzymatic and enzymatic systems that contribute to inactivation of free radicals . * The rate of decay of superoxide is significantly increased by the action of superoxide dismutases (SODs) found in many cell types. Glutathione (GSH) peroxidases are a family of enzymes whose major function is to protect cells from oxidative damage. The most abundant member of this family, glutathione peroxidase 1, is found in the cytoplasm of all cells. It catalyzes the breakdown of H2O2 by the reaction 2 GSH (glutathione) + H2O2 - GS-SG + 2 H2O. The intracellular ratio of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH) is a reflection of this enzyme's activity and thus of the cell's ability to catabolize free radicals. * Catalase, present in peroxisomes, catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (2H2O2 - O2 + 2H2O). It is one of the most active enzymes known, capable of degrading millions of molecules of H2O2 per second. * Endogenous or exogenous antioxidants (e.g., vitamins E, A, and C and b-carotene) may either block the formation of free radicals or scavenge them once they have formed.

        "exp": "Abnormalities of the hepatic blood flow occur in various disease states and result in characteristic symptoms. Because of their dual blood supply, aerial occlusion of either the hepatic aery or the poal vein rarely results in liver infarcts. However, thrombosis of branches of the hepatic aery may result in a pale (anemic) infarct, or possibly a hemorrhagic infarct due to blood flow from the poal vein. In contrast, occlusion of the poal vein, which may be caused by cirrhosis or malignancy, may result in a wedge-shaped red area called an infarct of Zahn. This is a misnomer, however, since it is not really an infarction but instead is the result of focal sinusoidal congestion. Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome) is associated with polycythemia vera, pregnancy, and oral contraceptives. Clinically, Budd-Chiari syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, ascites, tender hepatomegaly, and hematemesis. Occlusion of the central veins, called venoocclusive disease, may be rarely seen in Jamaican drinkers of alkaloid-containing bush tea, but is much more commonly found following bone marrow transplantation (up to 25% of allogenic marrow transplants).

Changes in the Polyphosphoinositide metabolism and changes in the Ca2+ level of the cell may also play an impoant role. A number of actin-binding and organizing proteins localize to membrane ruffles and potentially target to transducing molecules. The characteristic feature of migrating cells Membrane Ruffling is a characteristic feature of many actively migrating cells. When the membrane is unable to attach to the substrate, the membrane protrusion is recycled back into the cell.

The major cause of chronic pancreatitis in adults is chronic alcoholism, while in children the major cause is cystic fibrosis.

This condition refers to the finding of the accessory duct being the major excretory duct of the pancreas. Chronic ductal obstruction may be a cause of chronic pancreatitis and may be associated with gallstones, but it is more appropriate to relate gallstones with acute ductal obstruction and resultant acute pancreatitis. Complications of chronic pancreatitis include pancreatic calcifications, pancreatic cysts and pseudocysts, stones within the pancreatic ducts, diabetes, and fat malabsorption, which results in steatorrhea and decreased vitamin K levels.

They are forms of thalassemia caused by reduced or absent synthesis of the beta chains of hemoglobin that result in variable outcomes ranging from severe anemia to clinically asymptomatic individuals. Global annual incidence is estimated at 1 in 100,000. Beta thalassemias are caused by mutations in the HBB gene on chromosome 11, inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The severity of the disease depends on the nature of the mutation. HBB blockage over time leads to decreased beta-chain synthesis. The body's inability to construct new beta-chains leads to the underproduction of HbA. Reductions in HbA available overall to fill the red blood cells in turn leads to microcytic anemia. Microcytic anemia ultimately develops in respect to inadequate HBB for sufficient red blood cell functioning. Due to this factor, the patient may require blood transfusions to make up for the blockage in the beta-chains. Repeated blood transfusions can lead to build-up of iron overload, ultimately resulting in iron toxicity. This iron toxicity can cause various problems, including myocardial siderosis and hea failure leading to the patient's death.",

The high levels of cytokines can lead to capillary leak and shock. Superantigens made by S. aureus and S. pyogenes cause toxic shock syndrome (TSS).Superantigens do not require processing and therefore are able to bind to MHC II molecules outside the peptide-binding cleft.TSST-1 stimulates most T-cells by binding directly to MHC-II and T-cell receptors. The net result is the production of large amounts of the cytokinesinterleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon g, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).Reference: Jawetz Melnick and Adelbergs Medical Microbiology; 27th edition; Chapter 8; Immunology",

Often the forehead is narrow, hands and feet small, height sho, skin light in color, and they are unable to have children. About 70% of cases occur when pa of the father's chromosome 15 is deleted.

        "exp": "Apoptosis results from the activation of enzymes called caspases (so named because they are cysteine proteases that cleave proteins after aspaic residues). The activation of caspases depends on a finely tuned balance between production of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. Two distinct pathways converge on caspase activation: the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway pro-apoptotic members of the family called Bax and Bak, which dimerize, inse into the mito- chondrial membrane, and form channels through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins escape into the cytosol. These sensors also inhibit the anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (see fuher on), enhancing the leakage of mitochondrial proteins. Cytochrome c, together with some cofactors, activates caspase-9. Other proteins that leak out of mitochondria block the activities of caspase antagonists that function as physiologic inhibitors of apop- tosis. The net result is the activation of the caspase cascade, ultimately leading to nuclear fragmentation. Conversely, if cells are exposed to growth factors and other survival signals, they synthesize anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, the two main ones of which are Bcl-2 itself and Bcl-xL. These proteins antagonize Bax and Bak, and thus limit the escape of the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins. Cells deprived of growth factors not only activate the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak but also show reduced levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, thus fuher tilting the balance toward death. ref Robbins 9/e p19",

        "exp": "Gallstones, which affect 10 to 20% of the adult population in developed countries, are divided into two main types. Cholesterol stones are pale yellow, hard, round, radiographically translucent stones that are most often multiple. Their formation is related to multiple factors including female sex hormones (such as with oral contraceptives), obesity, rapid weight reduction, and hyperlipidemic states. Their prevalence approaches 75% in some Native American populations. 7-a-hydroxylase is an enzyme involved in conveing cholesterol to bile acids. Decreased functioning of this enzyme, such as with a congenital deficiency or inhibition by clofibrate, causes excess secretion of cholesterol and an increased incidence of cholesterol gallstones. The other main type of gallstones are pigment stones, which are brown or black in color and composed of bilirubin calcium salts. They are found more commonly in Asian populations and are related to chronic hemolytic states, diseases of the small intestines, and bacterial infections of the biliary tree. In contrast to 7-a-hydroxylase and bile acid synthesis, 1-a-hydroxylase is involved in vitamin D synthesis, while 11-hydroxylase, 17-hydroxylase, and 21- hydroxylase are all enzymes found in the adrenal coex.

        "exp": "Ceain drugs are impoant in the control of acute inflammation because they inhibit poions of the metabolic pathways involving arachidonic acid. For example, coicosteroids induce the synthesis of lipocoins, a family of proteins that are inhibitors of phospholipase A2. They decrease the formation of arachidonic acid and its metabolites, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Aspirin, indomethacin, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in contrast, inhibit cyclooxygenase and therefore inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The prostaglandins have several impoant functions. For example, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), produced within the anterior hypothalamus in response to interleukin 1 secretion from leukocytes, results in fever. Therefore aspirin can be used to treat fever by inhibiting PGE2 production. PGE2 is also a vasodilator that can keep a ductus aeriosus open. At bih, breathing decreases pulmonary resistance and reverses the flow of blood through the ductus aeriosus. The oxygenated blood flowing from the aoa into the ductus inhibits prostaglandin production and closes the ductus aeriosus. Therefore prostaglandin E2 can be given clinically to keep the ductus aeriosus open, while indomethacin can be used to close a patent ductus. Prostaglandin F2 (PGF2) causes uterine contractions, which can result in dysmenorrhea. Indomethacin can be used to treat dysmenorrhea by inhibiting the production of PGF2. Bradykinin is a nonapeptide that increases vascular permeability, contracts smooth muscle, dilates blood vessels, and causes pain. It is pa of the kinin system and is formed from high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK). Histamine, a vasoactive amine that is stored in mast cells, basophils, and platelets, acts on H1 receptors to cause dilation of aerioles and increased vascular permeability of venules.
