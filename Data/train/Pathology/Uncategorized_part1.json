Sickle cell anemia Splenomegaly Splenomegaly refers strictly to spleen enlargement, and is distinct from hyperspineism, which connotes overactive function by a spleen of any size. Splenomegaly and hypersplenism should not be confused. Each may be found separately, or they may coexist. Clinically if a spleen is palpable, it means it is enlarged as it has to undergo enlargement by at least two folds to become palpable. However, the tip of the spleen may be palpable in a newborn baby up to 3 months of age Early sickle cell anemia may present with splenomegaly",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Endothelium The most acceptable hypothesis for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is \"the response to injury hypothesis\". According to this hypothesis, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response of the aerial wall initiated by injury to endothelium. Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis Following stages occurs in the pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis: Endothelial injury Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade. Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornestone in the development of atherosclerosis. After injury, endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 and there is increased permeability to endothelium. TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression. Migration of leukocytes When VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium. Leukocytes than cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space. Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells - formation of earliest lesion, i. e. fatty streak. Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modified LDL). Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-ct and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation. Maturation of plaque Smooth muscle cells synthesize extracellular matrix (especially collegen) and conve a fatty streak into a mature fibrofatty atheroma, and contribute to the progressive growth of atherosclerotic lesions.",

        "question": "MHC restriction is a pa of all except a. EUR'",
        "exp": "Autoimmune disorder Major histocompatibility complex: Major histocompatibility complex, also called the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex is a 4 megahase region on chromosome 6. This region is densely packed with genes. These genes encodes two major proteins or antigens i. e., MHC I & MHC II. These proteins play an impoant role in the differentiation of foreign cells from host cell. Presence of these proteins is necessary for identification of host cells. Identification of the cells is impoant for immune responses. If the cell is recognised as self, the immune system will not mount an immune response against it. How does MHC helps in this??? Cells continuously display small pieces of their own internal protein, carrying them, outsie the cell membrane where the immune system can see them. These peptides are just pieces of the normal proteins found inside the cell. These peptides are held together at the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex, which holds these peptides together for the immune system to examine them. Each persons immune system is customized early in life to ignore these peptides, so healthy cells are not able to trigger the immune system and they are left alone. But if any virus or other microorganism is multiplying inside the cell, the peptides synthesized by it also is displayed on the surface. The MHC displays these unusual (foreign) protein on the surface of the cell. The immune system is triggered because of these peptides, staing, a series of event that will eventually lead to killing of the cell containing foreign peptide. MHC is also the cause of tissue rejection during skin grafts and organ grafts. This is how the MHC protein got its name; the term histocompatibility refers to the difficulty of finding compatible grafts between a donor and a patient. Each person has their own collection of MHC molecules. If you graft a piece of skin that has a different collection of MHC types they will trigger the immune system to destroy the cell. So a compatible donor is needed such as a relative who has a similar collection of MHC molecules. MHC is also active against cancer Cancer cells, like normal cells, display pieces of their own protein on their surface. So if any of these proteins carries recognizable cancer mutations, this provides a signal to the immune system that something is wrong and the cell is killed. MHC plays role in activation of T helper cells (Th) MHC class II molecules are present on the membranes of dendritic cells, macrophages. These cell function as antigen presenting cell during immune response. They capture the antigen and present it to T helper cells. In response, the T helper cells secrete cytokines that stimulate B cell proliferation and antibody production. The impoant point about T helper cells is that they respond to only those antigens which have been presented to them by cells that have host matching MHC complex on the presenting cell. In general the antigen presenting cell. first phagocytoses the protein antigen and cleaves it to peptides in the lysosomes. These peptides are then extruded and attached to the presenting cell's surface MHC complex. T helper cells first, make sure, that these MHC class II molecules are host's own MHC and then responds appropriately. So, we can say that receptor on the T helper cell is thus responsive to the combination of antigen and host matching MHC complex on the presenting cell.

It isn't of diagnostic use in vivo since it requires a dissection of the airway tube, but it has value in post moem evaluations and for research. RI = gland/wall. RI is the Reid Index. Wall is the thickness of the airway wall between the epithelium and the cailage's perichondrium. Gland is the thickness of the mucous producing gland at the location of inspection. A normal Reid Index should be smaller than 0. 4, the thickness of the wall always more than double the thickness of the glands it contains. Hyperplasia and hyperophy of mucous glands as in chronic bronchitis causes them to be present at deeper levels in the bronchial wall and thicker in size, thus increasing the Reid Index beyond the normal value.",

        "question": "Increased osmotic fragility is characteristic of: September 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Hereditary spherocytosis. The normal red blood cell is a relatively impermeable biconcave disc which maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic, fluid will be taken into the cell to maintain stability. Eventually under very hypotonic conditions the cell will fill to capacity and rupture. Spherocytic red blood cells have a decreased capacity to expand, and will rupture in mildly hypotonic conditions that fail to lyse normal red cells. They thus exhibit increased osmotic fragility. Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solution. With the unincubated test, red cell osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occurs in a sodium chloride concentration > 0. 5%. Although increased osmotic fragility is characteristically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it may also be increased in other types of hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of spherocytes, paicularly auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and in hypernatermia (Na > 155 meq/L). Often the increased osmotic fragility in spherocytosis is limited to a small fraction of cells that are unusually susceptible to lysis. After incubation, the defect is magnified, and a striking increase in fragility will be seen in hereditary spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if hemolysis is not complete in a 0. 30% Na. C1 solution. Decreased osmotic fragility is associated with chronic liver disease, iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hyponatremia (Na < 130 meq/ L), polycythemia vera, and sickle cell anemia after splenectomy.",

Red (or hemorrhagic) infarcts: They found in tissues that have a double blood supply--eg, lung and liver--or in tissues such as intestine that have collateral vessels permitting some continued flow into the area although the amount is not sufficient to prevent infarction. The infarct is red because of extravasation of blood in the infarcted area from necrotic small vessels. Red infarcts may also occur in tissue if dissolution or fragmentation of the occluding thrombus permits reestablishment of aerial flow to the infarcted area. Venous infarcts are always associated with congestion and hemorrhage. They are red infarcts. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C. R. (1998). Chapter 9. Abnormalities of Blood Supply. In P. Chandrasoma, C.

        "exp": "Acute mastitis, frequently complicated by breast abscess formation, typically develops in the postpaum period, when the nipples are first subjected to the physical stresses of breast feeding. Bacteria enter the breast cracks in the nipple, and flourish in the microenvironment of the lactating breast. Acute mastitis causes redness, pain, and swelling in the affected breast; Staph. aureus is the most common pathogen. Although endocarditis could send septic emboli to the breast, Staph. aureus endocarditis is more commonly associated with bacteremia and fevers, proliferative glomerulonephritis, valvular dysfunction, and emboli to the brain, kidneys, heart, and gut. Inflammatory breast carcinoma does not invoke an inflammatory response, and it is not associated with an infection. Inflammatory breast carcinoma is characterized by tumor spread into the dermal lymphatics, producing diffuse induration and skin tenderness with the typical peau d'orange appearance. Mastitis arising in the perimenopausal period is usually a chronic mastitis, caused by obstruction of ducts due to inspissated secretions. Chronic mastitis is sterile. The breast tissue shows lymphocytes and plasma cells surrounding dilated ducts filled by cellular debris. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J. F., Moos P. J., Mackey D. C., Brown T. G. (2008). Chapter 17.

        "exp": "Most leg swelling is caused by oedema, the accumulation of \ufb02uid within the interstitial space. Unilateral swelling usually indicates a localised pathology in either the venous or the lymphatic system, while bilateral oedema often represents generalised \ufb02uid overload combined with the effects of gravity. However, all causes of unilateral leg swelling may present bilaterally, and generalised \ufb02uid overload may present with asymmetrical (and therefore apparently unilateral) oedema. Fluid overload may be the result of cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension (even in the absence of right ventricular failure), renal failure, hypoalbuminaemia or drugs (calcium channel blockers, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and others). Approximately 60% of lean body weight is water, two-thirds of which is intracellular. Most of the remaining water is found in extracellular compartments in the form of interstitial fluid; only 5% of the body's water is in blood plasma. As noted earlier, edema is an accumulation of interstitial fluid within tissues. Increase in hydrostatic pressure are mainly caused by disorders that impair venous return. Local increases in intravascular pressure caused, for example, by deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity can cause edema restricted to the distal portion of the affected leg. Reduction of plasma albumin concentrations leads to decreased colloidal osmotic pressure of the blood and loss of fluid from the circulation. Edema may result from lymphatic obstruction that compromises resorption of fluid from interstitial spaces. Reference: Davidson's Internal Medicine 23rd edition, page no. 186",

        "question": "All the following polyps are premalignant except: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Hyperplastic polyps. It is now appreciated that hyperplastic polyps are without malignant potential. Juvenile polyps that are single and have been completely excised carry no significant increased risk of malignancy. Multiple juvenile polyps can be a sign of the familial juvenile polyposis syndrome. This has a significant risk (approximately 10 per cent) of subsequent colon cancer and also a possible increased risk of cancers of the stomach and duodenum (first pa of the small intestine). Juvenile polyposis (JP). Autosomal dominant. Multiple hamaomatous polyps of the colorectum (98%), stomach (13%), small bowel (6%). Juvenile polyps are usually pedunculated, smooth, lobulated with a vulnerable surface. Diagnostic criteria:- 5 or more juvenile polyps in the colon or rectum; OR- One juvenile polyp and positive family history of JP; OR- Juvenile polyps outside the colon or rectum, i. e. stomach/small bowel. Family history positive in 20-50%, suggesting high incidence of spontaneous mutations or low penetrance. Children/ adolescents often presents with iron deficiency anemia, hypoproteinemia and retarded growth. Also rectal prolapse or other congenital abnormalities (15%) in CVS, Urogenital tract and CNS. Cancer risk:- Increased risk, lifetime risk of 20-60% for colorectal cancer.- Median age at diagnosis is 35-40 years.- Increased risk for gastric and duodenal cancers. Genetic testing- Germline mutations of the SMAD4 and BMPR1A are detected in 11-25% and 18-30% of patients of JPC.- Gastric polyposis seems to be more frequent and severe in patients with SMAD4 mutations. Treatment- Colectomy and gastric surgery in severe polyposis. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)<1% of all colorectal cancers. Autosomal dominant inherited disease, > 100 colorectal adenomas, caused by germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene APC (detectable in 80-90% of patients with typical FAP) Prevalence 1: 10000 with penetrance close to 100%. 25% of patients with FAP do not have positive family history. These are de novo germline mutations. Polyp development stas in distal colorectum at an average age of 15. Majority of patients become symptomatic with bloody diarrhea by the age of 25. Extracolonic manifestation:- Up to 90% of patients with FAP develop polyps in upper GIT- 30-40% gastric fundic gland polyposis and 5-10% gastric adenomas- Risk for gastric cancer not increased. Major causes of death in colectomized FAP patients are duodenal and ampullary cancer. Spigelman classification for polyposis in upper GIT to allow adequate follow up. Extra-intestinal manifestation of FAP include:- Desmoid tumours (10-20%)- Epidermoid cysts (30-50%)- Fibromas- Osteomas (often in the mandibula). Congenital hyperophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (70%)- Dental abnormalities. Gardner's syndrome:- Polyposis, epidermoid cysts, osteoma. Turcot's syndrome in FAP- Polyposis, CNS tumours (medulloblastoma). Increased risk observed for:- Hepatoblastoma, follicular thyroid cancer, brain tumours (usually medulloblastoma). Treatment:- Procedure: Proctocolectomy with ileal-pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA): Gold standard. Peutz Jeghers syndrome (PJS). Autosomal dominant. Special type of hamaomatous GI polyp (PJ polyp) and mucocutaneous melanin pigmentations. PJ polyps occur throughout alimentary tract with predilection for the small bowel. Mostly jejunal. Esophagus is spared. Rarely nose, gallbladder and ureter. Polyps characterized by extensive smooth muscle aborization throughout polyp. Pigment lesions in 95% of patients but may disappear with age. Mostly lips, peri-oral and intra-oral mucosa. Diagnostic criteria: 2 or more PJ polyps- One PJ polyp and mucocutaneous pigment lesion- One PJ polyp and positive family history of PJS. Endoscopic or surgical excision of large or symptomatic polyps is recommended. Family history is negative in up to 45% of index cases indicating de novo germline mutations. Recurrent colicky abdominal pain due to intussusception in adolescence or young adulthood. Also occult bleeding with iron-deficiency anemia. Pigmentation not always present in childhood and may fade later in life. Intra-epithelial neoplasia predisposes to cancer - hamaoma-adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Cancer risk:- 85% by age 70 years- 57% GI cancer.- Colorectal cancer most common with lifetime risk of 39%. Lifetime pancreatic cancer risk is 11%. Extraintestinal cancers include breast risk (31-50%), endometrium and ovary. Cancer uncommon before age 30 years. Almost all female patients with PJS develop potentially malignant ovarian tumour, the sex cord tumour with annular tubules (SCTAT). Malignant transformation in 20% of all cases. Seoli cell tumours considered as male equivalent of SCTAT with gynaecomastia. Genetic testing- PJS is caused by germline mutation of the STKII tumour suppressor gene.",

        "exp": "Jaundice Jaundice is not a disease but rather a sign that can occur in many different diseases. Jaundice is the yellowish staining of skin and sclerae which is caused by the high level of blood bilirubin. On the basis of etiology, jaundice can be divided into 3 types: - 1. Prehepatic jaundice Prehepatic jaundice is due to increased production of bilirubin which results in an increased bilirubin load presented to the liver. The liver is normal and is able to conjugate the bilirubin at a normal rate; However, due to overproduction of bilirubin, conjugation capacity of the liver is overwhelmed and unconjugated bilirubin is increased -> Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Prehepatic jaundice is caused by hemolysis, i. e., hemolytic anemia due to any cause, e. g., hereditary spherocytosis, Thalassemia, SCA, Malaria, Drugs (methyldopa, quinine) etc. 2. Hepatic jaundice Here the cause lies within the hepatocytes which have either a defect in the conjugation process or in the excretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile. This type of jaundice is caused by all causes of hepatitis (infection, alcohol, drugs, toxin or autoimmune); in congenital hyperbilirubenemias; and in cirrhosis. 3. Post hepatic (extrahepatic) jaundice Post hepatic jaundice is due to obstruction of the excretion into the bile, e. g., in stone in CBD, carcinoma pancreas, CBD carcinoma etc. Conjugation capacity of hepatocytes are normal and they continue their conjugation process without any interference leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.",

Typically, the thrombus contains microabscesses with a central focus of neutrophils surrounded by gran u lomatous inflammation. Later, the inflammatory process extends into contiguous veins and nerves and in time all three structures (aeries, veins and nerves) become encased in fibrous tissue, a characterstic that is very rare with other form of vasculitis. Clinical manifestations Thrombangitis obliterans affects vessels of upper and lower extremities. Symptoms are due to vascular insufficiency, i. e. Ischemia of toes, feet and fingers that can lead to ulcer and frank gangrene. Due to neural involvement, there may be severe pain, even at rest.",

Chronic hepatitis represents a series of liver disorders of varying causes and severity in which hepatic inflammation and necrosis continue for at least 6 months. Earlier chronic hepatitis was categorized into three types depending upon histopathological features. These are Chronic persistent hepatitis Chronic lobular hepatitis Chronic active hepatitis Now, this categorization has been replaced by more informative classification based upon a combination of clinical serological and histological variables. Now the classification is based upon - It's cause Its histologic activity or grade It's a degree of progression or stage (a) Classification by cause - In this, the hepatitis is classified according to the cause - such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-associated hepatitis. (b) Classification by Grade - This classification is based upon an assessment of necroinflammatory activity. An assessment of following histological features is made on liver biopsy - Periportal necrosis Piecemeal necrosis Bridging necrosis Portal inflammation (c) Classification by stage - This classification is based upon the degree of fibrosis. It reflects the levels of progression of the disease. Staging is based upon the degree of fibrosis as follows 0 = No fibrosis 1= Mild fibrosis (limited to portal tract) 2 = Moderate fibrosis (Portal and periportal fibrosis) 3 = Severe fibrosis including bridging fibrosis 4 = Cirrhosis",

        "exp": "After a fixed number of divisions, normal cells becomes arrested in a terminally nondividing state. How does the normal cells count their divisions i. e. How, do the cells find out that now they do'nt need to divide further. Cells achieve this through telomer shortening Telomers are short repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosome that are important for ensuring complete replication of chromosome ends. It consists of many arrays of TTAGGG repeats at tellninal of 3' ending strand. It confers stability to chromosomes. With each successive division there is some shortening of the telomers. Once the telomers are shortened beyond a certain point the ends of the chromosome are seen as broken i1 NA, which signals cell cycle arrest. The broken NA leads to activation of p53 dependent cell cycle check points causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis. Thus telomere shortening functions as a clock that counts cell division. How do the germ cells keep on dividing throughout their life??? In germ cells telomere shortening is prevented by the sustained function of the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomer. It is RNA dependent DNA polymerase. It has one segment that is complimentary to TTAGGG repeat and is used as template for the replication of telomeric sequence. This enzyme is absent from most somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle. Telomerase is present in Germ cells thus explaining the ability of these cells to self replicate extensively. If loss of telomere is the basis of finite life span then how do cancer cells continue to divide actively???? In cancer cells telomerase activity is reactivated. Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 90% of human tumours. Thus telomerase activity and maintenance of telomere length are essential for the replicative potential in cancer cells.",

The cellular debris is then removed by phagocytosis, mediated primarily by infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages.

        "exp": "This woman likely suffers from reflux esophagitis, a condition in which the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) does not adequately prevent acidic gastric contents from refluxing back into the distal esophagus. Most commonly, there is a defect in the LES mechanism itself, in addition to secondary causes such as pregnancy (due to increased abdominal pressure) and some medications (anticholinergics, beta-2 agonists, theophylline, nitrates, calcium-channel blockers). Symptoms can mimic cardiac chest pain and must be carefully evaluated. Complications of reflux esophagitis include esophageal strictures, ulcerations, laryngitis, pulmonary aspiration, and Barrett's esophagus (columnar metaplasia of the distal esophagus). Barrett's esophagus is considered a premalignant state, with roughly a 30-fold increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus transforms into columnar epithelium similar to gastric epithelium as a result of recurrent reflux of acidic gastric contents. Anginal pain, signaling cardiac ischemia, is generally not burning in nature, and is not relieved by antacids. Mallory-Weiss lesions are actual tears of the epithelia of the proximal stomach or distal esophagus as a result of retching (seen in anorexics and alcoholics). The incidence of pure squamous cell carcinoma is not increased by acid reflux disease. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J. F., Moos P. J., Mackey D. C., Brown T. G. (2008). Chapter 14.

Small granular vegetations consisting of fibrin develop on the undersurface of the leaflets of mitral and aoic valves. Fragments of vegetations may detach, resulting in embolism. Eventually, vegetations heal by organization of fibrin and subsequent fibrosis, leading to distoion of valve leaflets and resultant insufficiency or stenosis. The pathogenesis is unclear but is probably related to thrombotic diathesis. Hemorrhagic pericarditis is usually a consequence of tuberculosis or metastatic spread of cancer to the pericardium. An exudate containing blood accumulates in the pericardial sac, producing pain and a characteristic auscultatory phenomenon known as a pericardial rub. SLE is associated instead with fibrinous pericarditis, which also manifests with chest pain and pericardial rub. Infective endocarditis is prevalent in patients with damaged or prosthetic valves and in intravenous drug abusers. It is associated with formation of bulky, friable vegetations that consist of masses of fibrin, neutrophils, and bacteria. Such vegetations cause extensive destruction of valve leaflets and may release fragments into the bloodstream, with resultant septic embolism. There is no association between SLE and mitral valve prolapse, which is a frequent, usually asymptomatic, valvular abnormality that occurs in 2% to 3% of the general population. Mitral valve prolapse is also associated with Marfan syndrome. Complications include sudden death, thromboembolism, and mitral regurgitation. Ref: Kaul M. S., Tapson V. F., St. Clair E. (2011).

Normally, ACTH is released from the pituitary gland when necessary to stimulate the release of coisol from the adrenal glands. In pituitary Cushing's, a benign pituitary adenoma secretes ACTH. This is also known as Cushing's disease and is responsible for 65% of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. In adrenal Cushing's, excess coisol is produced by adrenal gland tumors, hyperplastic adrenal glands, or adrenal glands with nodular adrenal hyperplasia. Finally, tumors outside the normal pituitary-adrenal system can produce ACTH that affects the adrenal glands.

Angiogenesis from pre-existing blood vessels The major steps in this process are i. Vasodilatation by NO, and VEGF-induced increased permeability of the pre-existing vessel. ii. Proteolytic degradation of the basement membrane by metalloproteinases (MMPs) and disruption of cell-to-cell contact between endothelial cells by plasminogen activator. iii. Migration of endothelial cells towards angiogenic stimulus. iv. Proliferation of endothelial cells, just behind the leading front of migrating cells. v. Maturation of endothelial cells. vi. Recruitment of periendothelial cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) to form the mature cells. 2. Angiogenesis from endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) EPCs can be recruited from the bone marrow into tissues to initiate angiogenesis. Growth factors involved in the process of angiogenesis o VEGF is the most important growth factor in adult tissues undergoing angiogenesis. o The most important receptor for VEGF is VEGFR-2, a tyrosine kinase receptor. o VEGF induces the migration of EPCs in the bone marrow, and enhances the proliferation and differentiation of these cells at sites of angiogenesis. o FGF 2 can also stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. o Newly formed vessels are fragile and need to become stabilized, which requires the recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells (peri-endothelial cells). Angiopoietin 1 and 2 (Ang 1 & 2), PDGF and TGF-fl participate in stabilization process. Remember o VEGF transcription is regulated by the transcription factor HIF, which is induced by hypoxia.",

        "question": "Essential for tumour metastasis is?",
        "exp": "Angiogenesis Tumour angiogenesis plays a very significant role in the metastasis since the new vessel formed as a pa of growing tumour are more vulnerable to invasion because these evolving cells are in direct contact with cancer cells. According to Harrison \"Cancer research studying the conditions necessary for cancer metastasis have discovered that one of the critical events required is the, growth of a new network of blood vessels called tumour angiogenesis\". Angiogenesis in tumours:? Tumour stimulates the growth of host blood vessels. Which is essential for supplying nutrients to the tumour. Tumours cannot enlarge beyond 1-2 mm in diameter or thickness unless they are vascularized because the 12 mm zone represents the maximal distance across which oxygen and nutrients can diffuse from blood vessels. Angiogenesis of tumour impas two benefits A) Growth of tumour By supplying oxygen and nutrient to tumour cells. Endothelial cells of new blood vessels secrete growth factors which stimulate the growth of adjacent tumour cells. B) Distant metastasis Without access to the vasculature, the tumour cells cannot rapidly spread to distant sites. Tumour associated angiogenic factors:? Tumours secrete ceain factors which induce neovascularization Two most impoant are? i) Vascular endothelial derived growth factor (VEGF) ii) Basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF) Steps in the spread of cancer? Aggressive clonal proliferation and angiogenesis The first step in the spread of cancer cells is the development of rapidly proliferating clone of cancer cells. Detachment of tumour cells Normal cells remain glued to each other due to presence of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) i. e. E cadherin. Normal function of E cadherin is dependent on catenins that helps in linkage of cytoskeleton to E cadherin. Down regulation of expression of either E cadherins or catenins results in loosening of cells that helps in metastasis. Tumour cell and extracellular matrix interaction Loosened cancer cells attach to ECM proteins mainly Laminin and fibronectin through a special protein integrin. Degradation of ECM Tumour cells overexpress proteases and matrix degrading enzymes i. e., metalloproteinases that includes collagenase and gelatinase. Another protease cathepsin D is also increased in ceain cancers. These enzymes bring about dissolution of extracellular matrix - Firstly basement membrane of tumour itself; is dissolved then it make way for the tumour cells through the interstitial matrix and. finally the basement membrane of the vessel wall is dissolved. Entry of tumour cells into capillary lumen:? Tumour cells after degrading the basement membrane are ready to migrate into lumen of capillaries or venules for which the following mechanisms play a role. i) Autocrine motility factor (AMF) is a cytokine derived from tumour cells and stimulate receptor mediated motility of tumour cells. ii) Cleavage product of matrix components. Which are formed following degradation of ECM have propeies of tumour cell chemotcuis, growth promotion and angiogenesis in cancer. After the malignant cells have migrated through the breached basement membrane, these cells enter the lumen of lymphatic and capillary channels. Thrombus formation The tumour cells protruding in the lumen of the capillary are now covered with constituents of the circulating blood and form the thrombus. Thrombus provides nourishment to the tumour cells and also prevent them from immune attack. Extravasation of tumour cells Tumour cells in the circulation may mechanically block these vascular channels and attach to vascular end. In this way, the sequence similar to local invasion is repeated and the basement membrane is exposed.",

Acute pancreatitis causes the release of many digestive enzyme precursors, which are then conveed to the active form in the damaged tissues. These enzymes degrade the adipose tissue around the pancreatic lobules, producing enzymatic fat necrosis. As pa of this process, many free fatty acids are produced that can bind as soaps with extracellular calcium in chemical equilibrium with serum calcium. This will often cause a significant decrease in serum calcium levels. Caseous necrosis is seen in granulomata produced by infection with M. tuberculosis. Coagulative necrosis preserves the outlines of cells in affected tissue. This common type of necrosis is seen in the heart following an infarct. Gangrenous necrosis is massive necrosis associated with loss of vascular supply, and is generally accompanied by bacterial infection. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J. F., Moos P. J., Mackey D.

Type II lesion (fatty streaks) o These lesions are due to accumulation of multiple lipid-filled macrophages (foam cells). o These are the earliest visible lesion of atherosclerosis. o They are not significantly raised and thus do not cause any disturbance in blood flow. Type III (intermediate) lesion o These are same as type II with small extracellular lipid pool. Type IV (atheroma) lesion o Type II change with core of extracellular lipid. Type V lesion (fibroatheroma or mature atherosclerosis) o This lesion is mature atherosclerotic plaque which has following structure. A. Fibrous cap It may be thin or thick. It contains-Smooth muscle cells, macrophages, foam cells, lymphocytes, collegen, elastin and proteoglycans. B. Necrotic core It is deep to the fibrous cap. Contains disorganised mass of lipid (primarily cholesterol and cholesterol esters), cell debris, some foam cells, fibrin, and other plasma proteins.",

Acute-phase proteins have beneficial effects during acute inflammation, but prolonged production of these proteins (especially SAA) in states of chronic inflammation can, in some cases, cause secondary amyloidosis. Chronically elevated plasma concentrations of hepcidin reduce the availability of iron and are responsible for the anemia associated with chronic inflammation. Systemic effects of inflammation: Fever: Cytokines (TNF, IL-I) stimulate production of PGs in hypothalamus. Production of acute-phase proteins: C-reactive protein, others; synthesis stimulated by cytokines (IL-6, others) acting on liver cells. Leukocytosis: Cytokines (CSFs) stimulate production of leukocytes from precursors in the bone marrow.

Immunophenotype of mantle cell lymphoma Mantle cell lymphoma is neoplasm of B cells. Therefore it expresses B cell marker: CD19, CD20 Surface immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgM and IgD). Either /c or X light chain. As the tumor cells are derived from Mantle zone, they are positive for B cell marker of mantle zone i. e., CD-5. Mantle cell lymphoma is CD23 negative, this feature distinguish it from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) which is positive for both CD5 and CD23. The other characteristic marker of mantle cell lymphoma is cycline DI. Cytogenetic abnormalities. Mantle cell lymphoma is associated with an 11: 14 translocation involving the IgH locus on chromosome 14 and the cyclin DI locus on chromosome 11. This leads to increased expression of cyclin D 1, which promotes GI to S phase progression during the cell cycle. 65 years old man with splenomegaly, lymphodenopathy CD-23 negative and CD-5 positive B-cell suggest the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma.

With adequate surgery the prognosis is excellent, with a cure rate of more than 95%. The risk of recurrence appears to be lower for tumors of the minor glands. Conservative enucleation of parotid tumors often results in recurrence, with management of these cases made difficult as a result of multifocal seeding of the primary tumor bed. In such cases, multiple recurrences are not unusual and may necessitate adjuvant radiation therapy. Tumors with a predominantly myxoid appearance are more susceptible to recur than those with other microscopic patterns. Key Concept: One of the characteristic is the microscopic presentation of tumour outside the Incomplete Capsule. So, the recurrence of pleomorphic adenoma is due to Incomplete Capsule.

Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogenic bone marrow transplantation but may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e. g. the liver) or transfusion of unirradiated blood. Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation. When such recipients receive normal bone man-ow cells from allogenic donors, the immunocompetent, T cells present in the donor marrow recognizes the recipient's HLA antigen as foreign antigen and react against them. Both CD4+ and CD8+T cells recognize and attack host tissues. In clinical practice GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between HIA matched donor and recipient. Acute GVH disease occurs within days to weeks after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Although any organ may be affected, the mayor clinical manifestation results from involvement of the immune system and epithelia of the skin, liver and intestines. Involvement of the skin in GVH disease is manifested by a generalized rash leading to desquamation in severe cases. Destruction of small bile ducts gives rise to jaundice and mucosal ulceration of the gut results in bloody diarrhoea. Immunodeficiency is a frequent accompaniment of GVH disease the immunodeficiency may be a result of prior treatment, myeloablative preparation for the graft, a delay in repopulation of the recipient's immune system and attack on host's inunune cells by grafted lymphocytes. Affected individuals are profoundly immunosuppressed and are easy prey to infections. Although many different types of organisms may infect patients, infection with cytomegalovirus is paicularly impoant.",

However, it does not discriminate between vascular defects, thrombocytopenia, and platelet dysfunction. Platelet enumeration Platelet volume measurements Platelet aggregation Clot Retraction: Clot retraction usually is deficient when the platelet count is below 50, 000411 and in a rare disorder of platelet function (Glanzmann thrombasthenia).

This test is primarily of historical interest; Glanzmann thrombasthenia is typically diagnosed using platelet aggregation methods or flow cytometer. Tests of Coagulation Phase: Paial thromboplastin time: The PTT is a simple test of the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. When a mixture of plasma and a phospholipid platelet substitute is re-calcified, fibrin forms at a normal rate only if the factors involved in the intrinsic pathway (prekallikrein, high-molecular-weight kininogen, and factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII) and in the common pathway (factors X and V, prothrombin, and fibrinogen) are present in normal amounts. The PTT is somewhat more sensitive to deficiencies of factors VIII and IX than to deficiencies of factors XI and XII or factors involved in the common pathway Prothrombin time The production of fibrin by means of the extrinsic and common pathways requires tissue factor and factor VII, in addition to factors X and V, Prothrombin, and fibrinogen Thromboplastin generation test: The thromboplastin generation test is impoant for historical reasons.

A partially cleft tongue is considerably more common and is manifested simply as a deep groove in the midline of the dorsal surface. The partial cleft results because of incomplete merging and failure of groove obliteration by underlying mesenchymal proliferation. Interestingly, it is often found as one feature of the oral-facial-digital syndrome in association with thick, fibrous bands in the lower anterior mucobuccal fold eliminating the sulcus and with clefting of the hypoplastic mandibular alveolar process.

Severe injury and GBM rupture lead to the leakage of plasma proteins through the GBM. Of these proteins, fibrin is thought to contribute most strongly to the crescent formation. Parietal epithelial cells lining the bowman capsule respond to the leaked fibrin and proliferate. Infiltrating white blood cells such as monocytes and macrophages also proliferate.

The Y chromosome is the other half of the XY gene pair in the male. However, the Y chromosome doesn't contain most of the genes of the X chromosome. It therefore doesn't protect the male. This is seen in diseases such as hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Autosomal dominant: Examples of this type of disorder are Huntington's disease, Neurofibromatosis 1, Marfan Syndrome, Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, and Hereditary multiple exostoses, which is a highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder.

The collegens are composed of a triple helix of three polypeptide a-chains. It provides tensile strength to tissues. Collegen type IV with laminin is the main component of basement membrane. Fibrillar collegen is synthesized from procollegen. First there is hydroxylation of lysin & proline residues of procollegen. After hydroxylation of lysine and proline residues of procollegen three procollegen chains align in phase to form triple helix. After that oxidation of lysine & hydroxylysine by lysyl oxidase, and proline & hydroxyproline by prolyl oxidase, take place - this results in cross-linking between the chains of adjacent molecules, thus stabilizing the array that is characteristic of collegen. Cross-linking is a major contributor of the tenile strength of collegen.

Mechanism of hyperophy o The increase in cell size is due to synthesis of more structural proteins. o The genes that are induced during hyperophy include those encoding transcription factors (C-fos, C-jun), growth factors (TGF-(3, TGF- 1, FGF); and vasoactive agents (a-agonists, endothelin-1, angiotensin II). o There may also be a switch of contractile proteins from adult to fetal or neonatal forms, e. g., during myocardial hyperophy, the a-myosin heavy chain is replaced by 13-form of the myosin heavy chain, which leads to decrease myosine ATPase activity and a slower, more energetically economical contraction. o In addition, some genes that are expressed only in embryonic life are re-expressed in hyperophied myocardium, e. g., in the embryonic heart, the gene for Atrial natriuratic peptide (ANP) is expressed in both atrium and ventricle. After bih, ventricular regulation of the gene is down regulated. Myocardial hyperophy is associated with reinduction of ANF gene expression. ANP induces salt excretion by kidney L blood volume & pressure, decrease work load. Why do these changes occur? o As already explained, the most common stimulus for myocardial hyperophy is increased workload. o All the above morphological changes that occur in hyperophy either increase muscle activity (to handle the increased workload) or decrease the workload to heart.",

Salmonella typhi primarily affects the ileum and colon, the terminal ileum is affected most often. o The peyer's patches show ovoid ulcers with their long axes along the axis of the ileum (remember that in intestinal tuberculosis, the ulcers are transverse to the axis of the bowel). o The margins of the ulcer are slightly raised, and the base of the ulcers is base black due to sloughed mucosa. o Though the enteric fever is an example of acute inflammation neutrophils are invariably absent from cellularinfiltrate and this is reflected in leucopenia with neutropenia and relative lymphocytosis in peripheral blood. Thecellular infiltrates in typhoid consists of phagocytic histiocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells. Complications of Typhoid? The most common complications of Typhoid are perforation and hemorrhage.

Which of the following parameters correlates best with the metastatic potential of this tumor?",
        "exp": "The tumor in the picture is a carcinoid. This neoplasm derives from the neuroendocrine cells of the intestinal epithelium and often retains the capacity to produce hormonal substances, such as serotonin, gastrin, somatostatin, etc. The architectural arrangement is variable, although trabecular and insular patterns are the most common. Carcinoid tumors may be found throughout the intestinal canal, as well as in the bronchial tree and other organs. Location and size are the most impoant predictor of their metastatic potential. Carcinoids of the appendix and cecum (the most frequent) only rarely metastasize to the liver. Carcinoids of the stomach, ileum and colon have a high metastatic propensity, especially if they are larger than 2 cm in main diameter. Neither architectural pattern nor cell pleomorphism is a good predictor of the malignant potential of carcinoid tumors. In general, this rule applies to most of endocrine tumors, in which histologic features and biologic behavior do not often correlate with one another. In other words, a tumor that shows relatively bland cells may undergo metastatic spread, while tumors with more anaplastic features may behave in a benign fashion. Hormonal production is common in carcinoids, but does not often lead to a clinical syndrome nor does it correlate with metastatic potential.",

        "exp": "The lesion described is sclerosing adenosis. The tip-offs in the description are the references to compressed glands and lobular orientation. Sclerosing adenosis is a common component of fibrocystic disease, and occurs when fibrosis distos the normal lobular architecture. The result can be some fairly bizarre, but completely benign, compressed glands that may mimic carcinoma on both frozen and permanent sections. Low power examination is often helpful, as this emphasizes the lobular character of the lesion. Note: Lesions actually involving the epithelium of the duct system typically have multiple layers of cells and range from usual ductal hyperplasia (with low risk of invasive carcinoma and characterized by the presence of both myoepithelial cells and epithelial cells within the duct) through atypical ductal hyperplasia (with medium risk of invasive carcinoma and characterized by ductal carcinoma in situ-like features only involving poions of a duct) to ductal carcinoma in situ (with relatively high risk of invasive carcinoma and characterized by clearly abnormal features such as loss of myoepithelial cells and formation of cribriform patterns involving complete cross-sections of ducts). Lobular carcinoma in situ typically produces lobular units whose lumina are completely filled with epithelial cells. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C. R. (1998). Chapter 56. The Breast. In P.

If the anemia is due to iron deficiency, one of the first abnormal values to be noted on a CBC, as the body's iron stores begin to be depleted, will be a high RBC distribution width, reflecting an increased variability in the size of RBCs. In the course of slowly depleted iron status, an increasing RDW normally appears even before anemia appears. A low MCV often appears next during the course of body iron depletion. It corresponds to a high number of abnormally small red blood cells. A low MCV, a low MCH and/or MCHC, and the appearance of the RBCs on visual examination of a peripheral blood smear narrows the problem to a microcytic anemia. The blood smear of a patient with iron deficiency shows many hypochromic (pale and relatively colorless) and rather small RBCs, and may also show poikilocytosis (variation in shape) and anisocytosis(variation in size). With more severe iron-deficiency anemia, the peripheral blood smear may show target cells, hypochromic pencil-shaped cells, and occasionally small numbers of nucleated red blood cells.",

Silica occurs in both crystalline and amorphous forms but crystalline forms are much more fibrogenic. The crystalline form are quaz, crystobalite. Silicosis is characterized in its early stages by nodules in the upper zones of the lung. As the disease progresses these nodules may coalesce into hard collagenous scars. o Fibrotic lesions occur in the hilar lymph node and pleura.

        "exp": "The infant is suffering from hereditary spherocytosis, a disease that can result from defective erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins such as spectrin or ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein in the erythrocyte that binds to the ankyrin/band 3 protein complex. It also binds to a protein 4. 1/actin complex to form a stable suppoing cytoskeletal network just below the plasma membrane. This helps to maintain the biconcave shape of the cell. Defective spectrin can lead to a destabilization of this network and a tendency of the affected cells to assume a spherical shape and become osmotically fragile. Such cells often become trapped in the splenic cords, and are subsequently destroyed by phagocytes. This can lead to hemolytic anemia, jaundice and splenomegaly. Clathrin is a protein found on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. It is located within the coating of the so-called coated pits seen in electron micrographs of cells engaged in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Connexon is a protein found in gap junctions, usually aggregated around the aqueous pores within the junctional area.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Emphysema. Pathogenesis of Emphysema The most accepted theory in the pathogenesis of emphysema is protease - antiprotease mechanism which is responsible in the pathogenesis of two common forms of emphysema, i. e. centriacinar and panacinar. o The alveolar wall destruction results from an imbalance between proteases (mainly elastase) and antiproteases in the lung. o Proteases (elastase) cause destruction of alveolar wall, while antiproteases prevent this damage. o acantitrypsin is the major antiprotease (antielastase) secreted by neutrophils during inflammation. Pathogenesis of panacinar emphysemao Panacinar emphysema is associated with congenital deficiency of arantinypsin. o This results in unchecked overactivity of neutrophil elastase that causes destruction of alveolar wall. o As occantitrypsin is deficient throughout the acinus, the acini are uniformly involved from the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli. o Neutrophils are the major cells in the pathogenesis of panacinar emphysema. Pathogenesis of centriacinar emphysemao Centriacinar emphysema is associated with smoking. o Nicotine acts as a direct chemoattractant for neutrophils and macrophages. So, in centriacinar emphysema, both neutrophils and macrophages play central role. Smoking enhances activity of neutrophil and macrophage elastase. o Macrophage elastase is not inhibited by a1-antitrypsin and indeed can proteolytically digest this antiprotease. Beside protease - antiprotease mechanism, oxidant - antioxidant imbalance also plays an impoant role in the pathogenesis of smoking related emphysema. o Normally, the lung contains a healthy complement of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, glutathione). o Tobacco smoke contains abundant reactive oxygen species (free radicals) which deplete these antioxidant mechanisms. o Free radicals cause tissue damage as well as they inactivate occantitrypsin, resulting in functional acantitrypsin deficiency even in patients without enzyme deficiency. Why smoking related emphysema involves centriacinar poion? The impaction of smoke paicles occurs predominantly at the bifurcation of respiratory bronchioles, resulting in the influx of neutrophils and macrophages, both of which secrete proteases. An increase in protease activity localized in the centriacinar region, together with the smoke induced oxidative damage, causes the centriacinar pattern of emphysema that is seen in smokers.",

Chronic sinuses discharging granules are caused by (1) Eumycetes (true fungi), (2) Schizomycetes, which includes. Actinomycosis (aerobic higher filamentous bacteria) and. Botryomycosis (bacterial infection).- Actinomycosis is often caused by Actinomadura or Nocardia species wherein it gains entry after penetrating trauma (splinter, gravel or thorn prick). Young males are commonly affected and 75% of the lesions occur in the lower limbs. The disease slowly progresses from a nodule to multiple sinuses discharging coloured granules. Involvement of bone is late following dermal and soft tissue spread.- Botryomycosis (a misnomer), a chronic suppurative infection is caused by bacteria involving skin or viscera. This rare condition mimics a deep mycotic infection and is often caused by Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas species of bacteria. The feet and hands are commonly affected and penetrating trauma may be a predisposing factor. It usually presents as a nodule, sinus or ulcer, which is initially localized. The diagnosis of actinomycosis is based on clinical findings, demonstration of characteristic granules and culture of the organism from a deep tissue biopsy. Immunological studies (counter immuno electrophoresis and ELISA) are also used. Botryomycosis is diagnosed based on a positive gram's stain and culture; negative fungal cultures and demonstration of the characteristic botryomycotic granules at histopathology from a deep biopsy. In endemic areas, subcutaneous swelling with sinuses should be considered as mycetoma unless proved otherwise.

The renal involvement is usually in the form of a necrotizing glomerulonephritis. The disease typically affects middle aged men, and its formerly poor prognosis has been improved by coicosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy. Note: Aspergillosis can cause prominent lung disease, but does not usually have renal involvement. Polyaeritis nodosa is a possibility, but usually spares the lungs. Renal cell carcinoma might cause lung nodules, but there is no evidence of tumor in the kidney.",

Numerous small emboli may obstruct most of the pulmonary circulation resulting in acute right heart failure. Another mechanism is by release of vasoconstrictor substances from platelets or by reflex vasoconstriction of pulmonary vessels. iii) Pulmonary infarction. Obstruction of relatively smallsized pulmonary arterial branches may result in pulmonary infarction. The clinical features include chest pain due to fibrinous pleuritis, haemoptysis and dyspnoea due to reduced functioning pulmonary parenchyma. iv) Pulmonary haemorrhage. Obstruction of terminal branches (endarteries) leads to central pulmonary haemorrhage. The clinical features are haemoptysis, dyspnoea, and less commonly, chest pain due to central location of pulmonary haemorrhage. Sometimes, there may be concomitant pulmonary infarction. v) Resolution. Vast majority of small pulmonary emboli (60-80%) are resolved by fibrinolytic activity. These patients are clinically silent owing to bronchial circulation so that lung parenchyma is adequately perfused. vi) Pulmonary hypertension, chronic cor pulmonale and pulmonary arteriosclerosis.

Arteriosclerosis means hardening of arteries by thickening and loss of elasticity of arterial wall. There are three patterns of arteriosclerosis. 1. Atherosclerosis Characterized by intimal lesions, i. e. atheromas, which project into a vascular lumen and may obstruct it. This is the most common pattern of arteriosclerosis. It involves elastic arteries and large & medium size muscular arteries. 2. Arteriolosclerosis Seen in arterioles of patients with hypertension and diabetes. Two anatomic variants are common hyaline and hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis. 3. Monckeberg medial calcific sclerosis It is seen in small and medium-sized muscular arteries. It is a degenerative and apparently non-inflammatory disease. Media of these arteries becomes calcified. It occurs in patients older than 50 years.",

        "question": "Invasive carcinoma differs from carcinoma in situ by: March 2005",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Breached basement membrane Carcinoma in situ (CIS) is an early form of carcinoma. When dysplastic changes are marked and involves the entire thickness of the epithelium but the leasion remains confined by the basement membrane, it is referred to as carcinoma in situ. Once the tumour cells breach the basement membrane, the tumour is said to be invasive. For example, carcinoma in situ of the skin, also called Bowen's disease, is the accumulation of neoplastic epidermal cells within the epidermis only. For this reason, CIS will usually not form a tumour. Rather, the lesion is flat (in the skin, cervix, etc) or follows the existing architecture of the organ (in the breast, lung, etc). Some CIS, however, form tumours, for example colon polyps or papillary cancer of the bladder as well as some CIS of the breast (more properly called Ductal Carcinoma in situ). Many forms of invasive carcinoma originate from a CIS lesion. Therefore, CIS is considered a precursor or incipient form of cancer that may, if left untreated long enough, transform into a malignant neoplasm. These terms are related since they represent the three steps of the progression toward cancer: Dysplasia is the earliest form of pre-cancerous lesion recognizable in a biopsy Dysplasia can be low grade or high grade. The risk of low-grade dysplasia transforming into cancer is low. Carcinoma in situ is synonymous with high-grade dysplasia in most organs. The risk of transforming into cancer is high. Invasive carcinoma, commonly called cancer, is the final step in this sequence.",

Necrosis in glioblastoma often results in a SERPENTINE pattern in areas of hyper-cellularity. Tumor cells collect along the edges of the necrotic regions, producing histologic pattern referred to as pseudopalisading pattern. GLIOMAS Gliomas are tumors of the brain parenchyma that histologically resemble different types of glial cells. The major types of tumor in this category are: a. Astrocytomas b. Oligodendrogliomas c. Ependymomas. ASTROCYTOMAS Two major categories of astrocytoma, infiltrating and non-infiltrating types. Infiltrating astrocytomas account for about 80% of adult primary brain tumors. They are most frequent in the fourth through sixth decades. They are usually found in the cerebral hemispheres. The most common presenting signs and symptoms are seizures, headaches and focal neurologic deficits related to the anatomic site of involvement. Infiltrating astrocytomas show a spectrum of histologic differentiation that correlates well with clinical course and outcome. Based on the degree of differentiation, they are classified into four groups: Pilocytic astrocytoma - Grade I - Most common Astrocytoma - Grade 2 Anaplastic astrocytoma - Grade 3 Glioblastoma multiforme - Grade 4 - Least differentiated PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA Pilocytic astrocytomas are relatively benign tumors, often cystic, that typically occur in children and young adults. They are usually located in the cerebellum; also in the floor and walls of the third ventricle, the optic nerves, and occasionally the cerebral hemispheres. A pilocytic astrocytoma is often cystic, with a mural nodule in the wall of the cyst; if solid, it is usually well circumscribed. The tumor is composed of areas with bipolar cells with long, thin \"'hairlike\" processes that are GFAP positive: Rosenthal fibers, eosinophilic granular bodies, and microcysts are often present. Necrosis and mitoses are absent. OLIGODENDROGLIOMAS These tumors constitute about 5% to 15% of gliomas and are most common in the fourth and fifth decades. Patients may have had several years of neurologic complaints, often including seizures. The lesions are found mostly in the cerebral hemispheres, with a predilection for white matter. Oligodendrogliomas are infiltrative tumors that form gelatinous, gray masses, and may show cysts, focal hemorrhage and calcification. On microscopic examination, the tumor is composed of sheets of regular cells with spherical nuclei containing finely granular chromatin (similar to normal oligodendrocytes) surrounded by a clear halo of cytoplasm. The tumor typically contains a delicate network of anastomosing capillaries. Calcification, present in as many as 90% of these tumors, ranges from microscopic foci to massive depositions. With increasing cell density, nuclear anaplasia, increased mitotic activity and necrosis, the tumor becomes higher grade (anaplastic oligodendroglioma.) Patients with oligodendrogliomas have a better prognosis than do patients with astrocytomas. Current treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy yields an average survival of 5 to 10 years. Patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma have a worse prognosis. EPENDYMOMAS Ependymomas most often arise next to the ependyma-lined ventricular system, including the central canal of the spinal cord. In the first two decades of life, they typically occur near the fourth ventricle and constitute 5% to 10% of the primary brain tumors in this age group. In adults, the spinal cord is their most common location; tumors in this site are particularly frequent in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 2. Because ependymomas usually grow within the ventricles. CSF dissemination is a common occurrence. In the fourth ventricle, ependymomas are typically solid or papillary masses extending from the floor of the ventricle. These tumors are composed of cells with regular, round to oval nuclei with abundant granular chromatin. Between the nuclei there is a variably dense fibrillary background. Tumor cells may form round or elongated structures (rosettes, canals) that resemble the embryologic ependymal canal, with long, delicate processes extending into a lumen. More frequently present are perivascular pseudo-rosettes in which tumor cells are arranged around vessels with an intervening zone consisting of thin ependymal processes directed toward the wall of the vessel. Anaplastic ependymomas show increased cell density, high mitotic rates, necrosis and less evident ependymal differentiation. The clinical outcome for completely resected supratentorial and spinal ependymomas is better than for those in the posterior fossa.",

They arise in atherosclerotic plaques, and render them more susceptible to sudden occlusion and acute infarction of the supplied tissues.

Thrombi are typified by the lines of Zahn, alternating layers of platelets and fibrin (the pale lines) and layers of blood (the dark lines). Beyond thrombus formation, other features of a complicated plaque include hemorrhage into the lesion itself, and microembolism by cholesterol crystals or calcified debris. Fuhermore, the weakened media underlying the plaque may develop an aneurysmal dilatation. In general, the clinical significance of atherosclerosis is related to the consequences of complicated lesions.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Copper In Wilson disease, main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. Liver disease may present as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and poal hypertension. On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia. About half the patients with Wilson's have neurological or psychiatric problems. Specific neurological symptoms then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (increased rigidity and slowing of routine movements) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of pa of the body). Various medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease: Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible around the iris. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea. They do not occur in all patients and may only be visible on slit lamp examination. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts, brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis, a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the PCT leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), weakening of the bone (due to calcium and phosphate loss) and occasionally aminoaciduria. Heart: cardiomyopathy and arrythmias Hormones: hypoparathyroidism, infeility and habitual aboion.",
