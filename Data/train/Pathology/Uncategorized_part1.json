Sickle cell anemia Splenomegaly Splenomegaly refers strictly to spleen enlargement, and is distinct from hyperspineism, which connotes overactive function by a spleen of any size. Splenomegaly and hypersplenism should not be confused. Each may be found separately, or they may coexist. Clinically if a spleen is palpable, it means it is enlarged as it has to undergo enlargement by at least two folds to become palpable. However, the tip of the spleen may be palpable in a newborn baby up to 3 months of age Early sickle cell anemia may present with splenomegaly",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Endothelium The most acceptable hypothesis for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is \"the response to injury hypothesis\". According to this hypothesis, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response of the aerial wall initiated by injury to endothelium. Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis Following stages occurs in the pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis: Endothelial injury Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade. Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornestone in the development of atherosclerosis. After injury, endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 and there is increased permeability to endothelium. TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression. Migration of leukocytes When VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium. Leukocytes than cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space. Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells - formation of earliest lesion, i. e. fatty streak. Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modified LDL). Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-ct and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation. Maturation of plaque Smooth muscle cells synthesize extracellular matrix (especially collegen) and conve a fatty streak into a mature fibrofatty atheroma, and contribute to the progressive growth of atherosclerotic lesions.",

Also know: Anti-DNA topoisomerase I, also called anti-Scl-70 occurs commonly (64-75%) in diffuse scleroderma, but only rarely in CREST syndrome.

It isn't of diagnostic use in vivo since it requires a dissection of the airway tube, but it has value in post moem evaluations and for research. RI = gland/wall. RI is the Reid Index. Wall is the thickness of the airway wall between the epithelium and the cailage's perichondrium. Gland is the thickness of the mucous producing gland at the location of inspection. A normal Reid Index should be smaller than 0. 4, the thickness of the wall always more than double the thickness of the glands it contains. Hyperplasia and hyperophy of mucous glands as in chronic bronchitis causes them to be present at deeper levels in the bronchial wall and thicker in size, thus increasing the Reid Index beyond the normal value.",

        "question": "Increased osmotic fragility is characteristic of: September 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Hereditary spherocytosis. The normal red blood cell is a relatively impermeable biconcave disc which maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic, fluid will be taken into the cell to maintain stability. Eventually under very hypotonic conditions the cell will fill to capacity and rupture. Spherocytic red blood cells have a decreased capacity to expand, and will rupture in mildly hypotonic conditions that fail to lyse normal red cells. They thus exhibit increased osmotic fragility. Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solution. With the unincubated test, red cell osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occurs in a sodium chloride concentration > 0. 5%. Although increased osmotic fragility is characteristically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it may also be increased in other types of hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of spherocytes, paicularly auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and in hypernatermia (Na > 155 meq/L). Often the increased osmotic fragility in spherocytosis is limited to a small fraction of cells that are unusually susceptible to lysis. After incubation, the defect is magnified, and a striking increase in fragility will be seen in hereditary spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if hemolysis is not complete in a 0. 30% Na. C1 solution. Decreased osmotic fragility is associated with chronic liver disease, iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hyponatremia (Na < 130 meq/ L), polycythemia vera, and sickle cell anemia after splenectomy.",

Bacteria enter the breast cracks in the nipple, and flourish in the microenvironment of the lactating breast. Acute mastitis causes redness, pain, and swelling in the affected breast; Staph. aureus is the most common pathogen. Although endocarditis could send septic emboli to the breast, Staph. aureus endocarditis is more commonly associated with bacteremia and fevers, proliferative glomerulonephritis, valvular dysfunction, and emboli to the brain, kidneys, heart, and gut. Inflammatory breast carcinoma does not invoke an inflammatory response, and it is not associated with an infection. Inflammatory breast carcinoma is characterized by tumor spread into the dermal lymphatics, producing diffuse induration and skin tenderness with the typical peau d'orange appearance. Mastitis arising in the perimenopausal period is usually a chronic mastitis, caused by obstruction of ducts due to inspissated secretions. Chronic mastitis is sterile. The breast tissue shows lymphocytes and plasma cells surrounding dilated ducts filled by cellular debris. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J. F., Moos P. J., Mackey D. C., Brown T. G. (2008). Chapter 17.

Polycystic liver disease There are multiple diffuse cystic lesions in the liver. Congenital hepatic fibrosis Portal tracts are enlarged by irregular, broad bands of collagenous tissue, forming septa that divide the liver into irregular islands. Variable numbers of abnormally shaped bile ducts are embedded in the fibrous tissue and are in continuity with the biliary tree. Caroli disease The larger ducts of the intrahepatic biliary tree are segmentally dilated and contain inspissated bile.",

        "exp": "Most leg swelling is caused by oedema, the accumulation of \ufb02uid within the interstitial space. Unilateral swelling usually indicates a localised pathology in either the venous or the lymphatic system, while bilateral oedema often represents generalised \ufb02uid overload combined with the effects of gravity. However, all causes of unilateral leg swelling may present bilaterally, and generalised \ufb02uid overload may present with asymmetrical (and therefore apparently unilateral) oedema. Fluid overload may be the result of cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension (even in the absence of right ventricular failure), renal failure, hypoalbuminaemia or drugs (calcium channel blockers, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and others). Approximately 60% of lean body weight is water, two-thirds of which is intracellular. Most of the remaining water is found in extracellular compartments in the form of interstitial fluid; only 5% of the body's water is in blood plasma. As noted earlier, edema is an accumulation of interstitial fluid within tissues. Increase in hydrostatic pressure are mainly caused by disorders that impair venous return. Local increases in intravascular pressure caused, for example, by deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity can cause edema restricted to the distal portion of the affected leg. Reduction of plasma albumin concentrations leads to decreased colloidal osmotic pressure of the blood and loss of fluid from the circulation. Edema may result from lymphatic obstruction that compromises resorption of fluid from interstitial spaces. Reference: Davidson's Internal Medicine 23rd edition, page no. 186",

Jaundice is the yellowish staining of skin and sclerae which is caused by the high level of blood bilirubin. On the basis of etiology, jaundice can be divided into 3 types: - 1. Prehepatic jaundice Prehepatic jaundice is due to increased production of bilirubin which results in an increased bilirubin load presented to the liver. The liver is normal and is able to conjugate the bilirubin at a normal rate; However, due to overproduction of bilirubin, conjugation capacity of the liver is overwhelmed and unconjugated bilirubin is increased -> Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Prehepatic jaundice is caused by hemolysis, i. e., hemolytic anemia due to any cause, e. g., hereditary spherocytosis, Thalassemia, SCA, Malaria, Drugs (methyldopa, quinine) etc. 2. Hepatic jaundice Here the cause lies within the hepatocytes which have either a defect in the conjugation process or in the excretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile. This type of jaundice is caused by all causes of hepatitis (infection, alcohol, drugs, toxin or autoimmune); in congenital hyperbilirubenemias; and in cirrhosis. 3. Post hepatic (extrahepatic) jaundice Post hepatic jaundice is due to obstruction of the excretion into the bile, e. g., in stone in CBD, carcinoma pancreas, CBD carcinoma etc. Conjugation capacity of hepatocytes are normal and they continue their conjugation process without any interference leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.",

Thromboangitis obliterans occurs almost exclusively among heavy-cigarrete-smoking persons. It is more common in men but incidence is increasing in women because of increasing smoking habit in women. o Buerger disease is associated with HLA B-5 and HLA-A9. In thrombongitis obliterans there is acute and chronic segmental inflammation of vessels with accompanied thrombosis in the lumen. Typically, the thrombus contains microabscesses with a central focus of neutrophils surrounded by gran u lomatous inflammation. Later, the inflammatory process extends into contiguous veins and nerves and in time all three structures (aeries, veins and nerves) become encased in fibrous tissue, a characterstic that is very rare with other form of vasculitis. Clinical manifestations Thrombangitis obliterans affects vessels of upper and lower extremities. Symptoms are due to vascular insufficiency, i. e. Ischemia of toes, feet and fingers that can lead to ulcer and frank gangrene. Due to neural involvement, there may be severe pain, even at rest.",

Chronic hepatitis represents a series of liver disorders of varying causes and severity in which hepatic inflammation and necrosis continue for at least 6 months. Earlier chronic hepatitis was categorized into three types depending upon histopathological features. These are Chronic persistent hepatitis Chronic lobular hepatitis Chronic active hepatitis Now, this categorization has been replaced by more informative classification based upon a combination of clinical serological and histological variables. Now the classification is based upon - It's cause Its histologic activity or grade It's a degree of progression or stage (a) Classification by cause - In this, the hepatitis is classified according to the cause - such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-associated hepatitis. (b) Classification by Grade - This classification is based upon an assessment of necroinflammatory activity. An assessment of following histological features is made on liver biopsy - Periportal necrosis Piecemeal necrosis Bridging necrosis Portal inflammation (c) Classification by stage - This classification is based upon the degree of fibrosis. It reflects the levels of progression of the disease. Staging is based upon the degree of fibrosis as follows 0 = No fibrosis 1= Mild fibrosis (limited to portal tract) 2 = Moderate fibrosis (Portal and periportal fibrosis) 3 = Severe fibrosis including bridging fibrosis 4 = Cirrhosis",

How, do the cells find out that now they do'nt need to divide further. Cells achieve this through telomer shortening Telomers are short repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosome that are important for ensuring complete replication of chromosome ends. It consists of many arrays of TTAGGG repeats at tellninal of 3' ending strand. It confers stability to chromosomes. With each successive division there is some shortening of the telomers. Once the telomers are shortened beyond a certain point the ends of the chromosome are seen as broken i1 NA, which signals cell cycle arrest. The broken NA leads to activation of p53 dependent cell cycle check points causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis. Thus telomere shortening functions as a clock that counts cell division. How do the germ cells keep on dividing throughout their life??? In germ cells telomere shortening is prevented by the sustained function of the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomer. It is RNA dependent DNA polymerase. It has one segment that is complimentary to TTAGGG repeat and is used as template for the replication of telomeric sequence. This enzyme is absent from most somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle. Telomerase is present in Germ cells thus explaining the ability of these cells to self replicate extensively. If loss of telomere is the basis of finite life span then how do cancer cells continue to divide actively???? In cancer cells telomerase activity is reactivated. Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 90% of human tumours. Thus telomerase activity and maintenance of telomere length are essential for the replicative potential in cancer cells.",

Small granular vegetations consisting of fibrin develop on the undersurface of the leaflets of mitral and aoic valves. Fragments of vegetations may detach, resulting in embolism. Eventually, vegetations heal by organization of fibrin and subsequent fibrosis, leading to distoion of valve leaflets and resultant insufficiency or stenosis. The pathogenesis is unclear but is probably related to thrombotic diathesis. Hemorrhagic pericarditis is usually a consequence of tuberculosis or metastatic spread of cancer to the pericardium. An exudate containing blood accumulates in the pericardial sac, producing pain and a characteristic auscultatory phenomenon known as a pericardial rub. SLE is associated instead with fibrinous pericarditis, which also manifests with chest pain and pericardial rub. Infective endocarditis is prevalent in patients with damaged or prosthetic valves and in intravenous drug abusers. It is associated with formation of bulky, friable vegetations that consist of masses of fibrin, neutrophils, and bacteria. Such vegetations cause extensive destruction of valve leaflets and may release fragments into the bloodstream, with resultant septic embolism. There is no association between SLE and mitral valve prolapse, which is a frequent, usually asymptomatic, valvular abnormality that occurs in 2% to 3% of the general population. Mitral valve prolapse is also associated with Marfan syndrome. Complications include sudden death, thromboembolism, and mitral regurgitation. Ref: Kaul M. S., Tapson V. F., St. Clair E. (2011).

Germline mosaicism o Germline mosacism results from a mutation that occurs postzygotically during early embryonic development.

Angiogenesis from pre-existing blood vessels The major steps in this process are i. Vasodilatation by NO, and VEGF-induced increased permeability of the pre-existing vessel. ii. Proteolytic degradation of the basement membrane by metalloproteinases (MMPs) and disruption of cell-to-cell contact between endothelial cells by plasminogen activator. iii. Migration of endothelial cells towards angiogenic stimulus. iv. Proliferation of endothelial cells, just behind the leading front of migrating cells. v. Maturation of endothelial cells. vi. Recruitment of periendothelial cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) to form the mature cells. 2. Angiogenesis from endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) EPCs can be recruited from the bone marrow into tissues to initiate angiogenesis. Growth factors involved in the process of angiogenesis o VEGF is the most important growth factor in adult tissues undergoing angiogenesis. o The most important receptor for VEGF is VEGFR-2, a tyrosine kinase receptor. o VEGF induces the migration of EPCs in the bone marrow, and enhances the proliferation and differentiation of these cells at sites of angiogenesis. o FGF 2 can also stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. o Newly formed vessels are fragile and need to become stabilized, which requires the recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells (peri-endothelial cells).

        "exp": "Angiogenesis Tumour angiogenesis plays a very significant role in the metastasis since the new vessel formed as a pa of growing tumour are more vulnerable to invasion because these evolving cells are in direct contact with cancer cells. According to Harrison \"Cancer research studying the conditions necessary for cancer metastasis have discovered that one of the critical events required is the, growth of a new network of blood vessels called tumour angiogenesis\". Angiogenesis in tumours:? Tumour stimulates the growth of host blood vessels. Which is essential for supplying nutrients to the tumour. Tumours cannot enlarge beyond 1-2 mm in diameter or thickness unless they are vascularized because the 12 mm zone represents the maximal distance across which oxygen and nutrients can diffuse from blood vessels. Angiogenesis of tumour impas two benefits A) Growth of tumour By supplying oxygen and nutrient to tumour cells. Endothelial cells of new blood vessels secrete growth factors which stimulate the growth of adjacent tumour cells. B) Distant metastasis Without access to the vasculature, the tumour cells cannot rapidly spread to distant sites. Tumour associated angiogenic factors:? Tumours secrete ceain factors which induce neovascularization Two most impoant are? i) Vascular endothelial derived growth factor (VEGF) ii) Basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF) Steps in the spread of cancer? Aggressive clonal proliferation and angiogenesis The first step in the spread of cancer cells is the development of rapidly proliferating clone of cancer cells. Detachment of tumour cells Normal cells remain glued to each other due to presence of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) i. e. E cadherin. Normal function of E cadherin is dependent on catenins that helps in linkage of cytoskeleton to E cadherin. Down regulation of expression of either E cadherins or catenins results in loosening of cells that helps in metastasis. Tumour cell and extracellular matrix interaction Loosened cancer cells attach to ECM proteins mainly Laminin and fibronectin through a special protein integrin. Degradation of ECM Tumour cells overexpress proteases and matrix degrading enzymes i. e., metalloproteinases that includes collagenase and gelatinase. Another protease cathepsin D is also increased in ceain cancers. These enzymes bring about dissolution of extracellular matrix - Firstly basement membrane of tumour itself; is dissolved then it make way for the tumour cells through the interstitial matrix and. finally the basement membrane of the vessel wall is dissolved. Entry of tumour cells into capillary lumen:? Tumour cells after degrading the basement membrane are ready to migrate into lumen of capillaries or venules for which the following mechanisms play a role. i) Autocrine motility factor (AMF) is a cytokine derived from tumour cells and stimulate receptor mediated motility of tumour cells. ii) Cleavage product of matrix components. Which are formed following degradation of ECM have propeies of tumour cell chemotcuis, growth promotion and angiogenesis in cancer. After the malignant cells have migrated through the breached basement membrane, these cells enter the lumen of lymphatic and capillary channels. Thrombus formation The tumour cells protruding in the lumen of the capillary are now covered with constituents of the circulating blood and form the thrombus. Thrombus provides nourishment to the tumour cells and also prevent them from immune attack. Extravasation of tumour cells Tumour cells in the circulation may mechanically block these vascular channels and attach to vascular end. In this way, the sequence similar to local invasion is repeated and the basement membrane is exposed.",

Other features include parathyroid hypoplasia (causing hypocalcemia), cardiac malformations & facial anomalies. TBX-1 gene (a T-box transcription factor) is most closely associated with this syndrome. The target of TBX-1 include PAX 9, a gene that controls the development of the palate, parathyroid and thymus. 2) Veto cardio facial sndrome.

        "exp": "The patient most likely has acute pancreatitis, which is commonly caused by either alcoholism or impaction of a small gallstone in the common bile duct. Acute pancreatitis causes the release of many digestive enzyme precursors, which are then conveed to the active form in the damaged tissues. These enzymes degrade the adipose tissue around the pancreatic lobules, producing enzymatic fat necrosis. As pa of this process, many free fatty acids are produced that can bind as soaps with extracellular calcium in chemical equilibrium with serum calcium. This will often cause a significant decrease in serum calcium levels. Caseous necrosis is seen in granulomata produced by infection with M. tuberculosis. Coagulative necrosis preserves the outlines of cells in affected tissue. This common type of necrosis is seen in the heart following an infarct. Gangrenous necrosis is massive necrosis associated with loss of vascular supply, and is generally accompanied by bacterial infection. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J. F., Moos P. J., Mackey D.

Three of the best-known of these proteins are: C-reactive protein (CRP). Fibrinogen. Serum amyloid A (SAA) protein. Acute-phase proteins have beneficial effects during acute inflammation, but prolonged production of these proteins (especially SAA) in states of chronic inflammation can, in some cases, cause secondary amyloidosis. Chronically elevated plasma concentrations of hepcidin reduce the availability of iron and are responsible for the anemia associated with chronic inflammation. Systemic effects of inflammation: Fever: Cytokines (TNF, IL-I) stimulate production of PGs in hypothalamus. Production of acute-phase proteins: C-reactive protein, others; synthesis stimulated by cytokines (IL-6, others) acting on liver cells. Leukocytosis: Cytokines (CSFs) stimulate production of leukocytes from precursors in the bone marrow. In some severe infections, septic shock: Fall in blood pressure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, metabolic abnormalities; induced by high levels of TBF and other cytokines.

So, RPGN is also known as crescentic glomerulonephritis.

Severe injury and GBM rupture lead to the leakage of plasma proteins through the GBM. Of these proteins, fibrin is thought to contribute most strongly to the crescent formation. Parietal epithelial cells lining the bowman capsule respond to the leaked fibrin and proliferate. Infiltrating white blood cells such as monocytes and macrophages also proliferate.

Fibrillar collegen is synthesized from procollegen. First there is hydroxylation of lysin & proline residues of procollegen. After hydroxylation of lysine and proline residues of procollegen three procollegen chains align in phase to form triple helix. After that oxidation of lysine & hydroxylysine by lysyl oxidase, and proline & hydroxyproline by prolyl oxidase, take place - this results in cross-linking between the chains of adjacent molecules, thus stabilizing the array that is characteristic of collegen.

Mechanism of hyperophy o The increase in cell size is due to synthesis of more structural proteins. o The genes that are induced during hyperophy include those encoding transcription factors (C-fos, C-jun), growth factors (TGF-(3, TGF- 1, FGF); and vasoactive agents (a-agonists, endothelin-1, angiotensin II). o There may also be a switch of contractile proteins from adult to fetal or neonatal forms, e. g., during myocardial hyperophy, the a-myosin heavy chain is replaced by 13-form of the myosin heavy chain, which leads to decrease myosine ATPase activity and a slower, more energetically economical contraction. o In addition, some genes that are expressed only in embryonic life are re-expressed in hyperophied myocardium, e. g., in the embryonic heart, the gene for Atrial natriuratic peptide (ANP) is expressed in both atrium and ventricle. After bih, ventricular regulation of the gene is down regulated. Myocardial hyperophy is associated with reinduction of ANF gene expression. ANP induces salt excretion by kidney L blood volume & pressure, decrease work load. Why do these changes occur? o As already explained, the most common stimulus for myocardial hyperophy is increased workload. o All the above morphological changes that occur in hyperophy either increase muscle activity (to handle the increased workload) or decrease the workload to heart.",

This neoplasm derives from the neuroendocrine cells of the intestinal epithelium and often retains the capacity to produce hormonal substances, such as serotonin, gastrin, somatostatin, etc. The architectural arrangement is variable, although trabecular and insular patterns are the most common. Carcinoid tumors may be found throughout the intestinal canal, as well as in the bronchial tree and other organs. Location and size are the most impoant predictor of their metastatic potential. Carcinoids of the appendix and cecum (the most frequent) only rarely metastasize to the liver. Carcinoids of the stomach, ileum and colon have a high metastatic propensity, especially if they are larger than 2 cm in main diameter. Neither architectural pattern nor cell pleomorphism is a good predictor of the malignant potential of carcinoid tumors. In general, this rule applies to most of endocrine tumors, in which histologic features and biologic behavior do not often correlate with one another. In other words, a tumor that shows relatively bland cells may undergo metastatic spread, while tumors with more anaplastic features may behave in a benign fashion.

They are structurally complex cells that possess interdigitating foot processes (pedicels). The adjacent foot processes are separated by 20-30 nm wide filtration slits. The filtration slit or slit diaphragm maintains glomerular barrier function.

        "exp": "The infant is suffering from hereditary spherocytosis, a disease that can result from defective erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins such as spectrin or ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein in the erythrocyte that binds to the ankyrin/band 3 protein complex. It also binds to a protein 4. 1/actin complex to form a stable suppoing cytoskeletal network just below the plasma membrane. This helps to maintain the biconcave shape of the cell. Defective spectrin can lead to a destabilization of this network and a tendency of the affected cells to assume a spherical shape and become osmotically fragile. Such cells often become trapped in the splenic cords, and are subsequently destroyed by phagocytes. This can lead to hemolytic anemia, jaundice and splenomegaly. Clathrin is a protein found on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. It is located within the coating of the so-called coated pits seen in electron micrographs of cells engaged in receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Pathogenesis of Emphysema The most accepted theory in the pathogenesis of emphysema is protease - antiprotease mechanism which is responsible in the pathogenesis of two common forms of emphysema, i. e. centriacinar and panacinar. o The alveolar wall destruction results from an imbalance between proteases (mainly elastase) and antiproteases in the lung. o Proteases (elastase) cause destruction of alveolar wall, while antiproteases prevent this damage. o acantitrypsin is the major antiprotease (antielastase) secreted by neutrophils during inflammation. Pathogenesis of panacinar emphysemao Panacinar emphysema is associated with congenital deficiency of arantinypsin. o This results in unchecked overactivity of neutrophil elastase that causes destruction of alveolar wall. o As occantitrypsin is deficient throughout the acinus, the acini are uniformly involved from the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli. o Neutrophils are the major cells in the pathogenesis of panacinar emphysema. Pathogenesis of centriacinar emphysemao Centriacinar emphysema is associated with smoking. o Nicotine acts as a direct chemoattractant for neutrophils and macrophages. So, in centriacinar emphysema, both neutrophils and macrophages play central role. Smoking enhances activity of neutrophil and macrophage elastase. o Macrophage elastase is not inhibited by a1-antitrypsin and indeed can proteolytically digest this antiprotease. Beside protease - antiprotease mechanism, oxidant - antioxidant imbalance also plays an impoant role in the pathogenesis of smoking related emphysema. o Normally, the lung contains a healthy complement of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, glutathione). o Tobacco smoke contains abundant reactive oxygen species (free radicals) which deplete these antioxidant mechanisms. o Free radicals cause tissue damage as well as they inactivate occantitrypsin, resulting in functional acantitrypsin deficiency even in patients without enzyme deficiency. Why smoking related emphysema involves centriacinar poion? The impaction of smoke paicles occurs predominantly at the bifurcation of respiratory bronchioles, resulting in the influx of neutrophils and macrophages, both of which secrete proteases. An increase in protease activity localized in the centriacinar region, together with the smoke induced oxidative damage, causes the centriacinar pattern of emphysema that is seen in smokers.",

Auses, soft tissue swelling and discharge of coloured granules characterize a mycetoma foot. Chronic sinuses discharging granules are caused by (1) Eumycetes (true fungi), (2) Schizomycetes, which includes. Actinomycosis (aerobic higher filamentous bacteria) and. Botryomycosis (bacterial infection).- Actinomycosis is often caused by Actinomadura or Nocardia species wherein it gains entry after penetrating trauma (splinter, gravel or thorn prick). Young males are commonly affected and 75% of the lesions occur in the lower limbs. The disease slowly progresses from a nodule to multiple sinuses discharging coloured granules. Involvement of bone is late following dermal and soft tissue spread.- Botryomycosis (a misnomer), a chronic suppurative infection is caused by bacteria involving skin or viscera. This rare condition mimics a deep mycotic infection and is often caused by Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas species of bacteria. The feet and hands are commonly affected and penetrating trauma may be a predisposing factor. It usually presents as a nodule, sinus or ulcer, which is initially localized. The diagnosis of actinomycosis is based on clinical findings, demonstration of characteristic granules and culture of the organism from a deep tissue biopsy. Immunological studies (counter immuno electrophoresis and ELISA) are also used. Botryomycosis is diagnosed based on a positive gram's stain and culture; negative fungal cultures and demonstration of the characteristic botryomycotic granules at histopathology from a deep biopsy. In endemic areas, subcutaneous swelling with sinuses should be considered as mycetoma unless proved otherwise. The differential diagnosis includes chronic osteomyelitis, tuberculosis and chronic abscesses.",

        "question": "Invasive carcinoma differs from carcinoma in situ by: March 2005",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Breached basement membrane Carcinoma in situ (CIS) is an early form of carcinoma. When dysplastic changes are marked and involves the entire thickness of the epithelium but the leasion remains confined by the basement membrane, it is referred to as carcinoma in situ. Once the tumour cells breach the basement membrane, the tumour is said to be invasive. For example, carcinoma in situ of the skin, also called Bowen's disease, is the accumulation of neoplastic epidermal cells within the epidermis only. For this reason, CIS will usually not form a tumour. Rather, the lesion is flat (in the skin, cervix, etc) or follows the existing architecture of the organ (in the breast, lung, etc). Some CIS, however, form tumours, for example colon polyps or papillary cancer of the bladder as well as some CIS of the breast (more properly called Ductal Carcinoma in situ). Many forms of invasive carcinoma originate from a CIS lesion. Therefore, CIS is considered a precursor or incipient form of cancer that may, if left untreated long enough, transform into a malignant neoplasm. These terms are related since they represent the three steps of the progression toward cancer: Dysplasia is the earliest form of pre-cancerous lesion recognizable in a biopsy Dysplasia can be low grade or high grade. The risk of low-grade dysplasia transforming into cancer is low. Carcinoma in situ is synonymous with high-grade dysplasia in most organs. The risk of transforming into cancer is high. Invasive carcinoma, commonly called cancer, is the final step in this sequence.",

Necrosis in glioblastoma often results in a SERPENTINE pattern in areas of hyper-cellularity. Tumor cells collect along the edges of the necrotic regions, producing histologic pattern referred to as pseudopalisading pattern. GLIOMAS Gliomas are tumors of the brain parenchyma that histologically resemble different types of glial cells. The major types of tumor in this category are: a. Astrocytomas b. Oligodendrogliomas c. Ependymomas. ASTROCYTOMAS Two major categories of astrocytoma, infiltrating and non-infiltrating types. Infiltrating astrocytomas account for about 80% of adult primary brain tumors. They are most frequent in the fourth through sixth decades. They are usually found in the cerebral hemispheres. The most common presenting signs and symptoms are seizures, headaches and focal neurologic deficits related to the anatomic site of involvement. Infiltrating astrocytomas show a spectrum of histologic differentiation that correlates well with clinical course and outcome. Based on the degree of differentiation, they are classified into four groups: Pilocytic astrocytoma - Grade I - Most common Astrocytoma - Grade 2 Anaplastic astrocytoma - Grade 3 Glioblastoma multiforme - Grade 4 - Least differentiated PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA Pilocytic astrocytomas are relatively benign tumors, often cystic, that typically occur in children and young adults. They are usually located in the cerebellum; also in the floor and walls of the third ventricle, the optic nerves, and occasionally the cerebral hemispheres. A pilocytic astrocytoma is often cystic, with a mural nodule in the wall of the cyst; if solid, it is usually well circumscribed. The tumor is composed of areas with bipolar cells with long, thin \"'hairlike\" processes that are GFAP positive: Rosenthal fibers, eosinophilic granular bodies, and microcysts are often present. Necrosis and mitoses are absent. OLIGODENDROGLIOMAS These tumors constitute about 5% to 15% of gliomas and are most common in the fourth and fifth decades. Patients may have had several years of neurologic complaints, often including seizures. The lesions are found mostly in the cerebral hemispheres, with a predilection for white matter. Oligodendrogliomas are infiltrative tumors that form gelatinous, gray masses, and may show cysts, focal hemorrhage and calcification. On microscopic examination, the tumor is composed of sheets of regular cells with spherical nuclei containing finely granular chromatin (similar to normal oligodendrocytes) surrounded by a clear halo of cytoplasm. The tumor typically contains a delicate network of anastomosing capillaries. Calcification, present in as many as 90% of these tumors, ranges from microscopic foci to massive depositions. With increasing cell density, nuclear anaplasia, increased mitotic activity and necrosis, the tumor becomes higher grade (anaplastic oligodendroglioma.) Patients with oligodendrogliomas have a better prognosis than do patients with astrocytomas. Current treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy yields an average survival of 5 to 10 years. Patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma have a worse prognosis. EPENDYMOMAS Ependymomas most often arise next to the ependyma-lined ventricular system, including the central canal of the spinal cord. In the first two decades of life, they typically occur near the fourth ventricle and constitute 5% to 10% of the primary brain tumors in this age group. In adults, the spinal cord is their most common location; tumors in this site are particularly frequent in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 2. Because ependymomas usually grow within the ventricles. CSF dissemination is a common occurrence. In the fourth ventricle, ependymomas are typically solid or papillary masses extending from the floor of the ventricle. These tumors are composed of cells with regular, round to oval nuclei with abundant granular chromatin. Between the nuclei there is a variably dense fibrillary background. Tumor cells may form round or elongated structures (rosettes, canals) that resemble the embryologic ependymal canal, with long, delicate processes extending into a lumen. More frequently present are perivascular pseudo-rosettes in which tumor cells are arranged around vessels with an intervening zone consisting of thin ependymal processes directed toward the wall of the vessel. Anaplastic ependymomas show increased cell density, high mitotic rates, necrosis and less evident ependymal differentiation. The clinical outcome for completely resected supratentorial and spinal ependymomas is better than for those in the posterior fossa.",

        "exp": "Complicated lesions indicate advanced atherosclerotic disease. They arise in atherosclerotic plaques, and render them more susceptible to sudden occlusion and acute infarction of the supplied tissues. Commonly, the plaque ulcerates or ruptures, and the exposed surfaces, being highly thrombogenic, precipitate thrombus formation. Thrombi are typified by the lines of Zahn, alternating layers of platelets and fibrin (the pale lines) and layers of blood (the dark lines). Beyond thrombus formation, other features of a complicated plaque include hemorrhage into the lesion itself, and microembolism by cholesterol crystals or calcified debris. Fuhermore, the weakened media underlying the plaque may develop an aneurysmal dilatation. In general, the clinical significance of atherosclerosis is related to the consequences of complicated lesions. The incorrect options all include features of atheromatous plaques, but do not indicate complicated lesions: Beneath the endothelium of a plaque there is a fibrous cap composed of smooth muscle, chronic inflammatory cells and lipid laden macrophages (foam cells), as well as extracellular material. The core of the lesion, which lies between the intima and the media, is composed of necrotic cellular debris, with cholesterol crystals, calcium, and more foam cells. Ref: Fuster V., Falk E. (2011).

        "exp": "Ans. A: Copper In Wilson disease, main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. Liver disease may present as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and poal hypertension. On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia. About half the patients with Wilson's have neurological or psychiatric problems. Specific neurological symptoms then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (increased rigidity and slowing of routine movements) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of pa of the body). Various medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease: Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible around the iris. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea. They do not occur in all patients and may only be visible on slit lamp examination. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts, brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis, a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the PCT leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), weakening of the bone (due to calcium and phosphate loss) and occasionally aminoaciduria. Heart: cardiomyopathy and arrythmias Hormones: hypoparathyroidism, infeility and habitual aboion.",

Microcytic hypochromic anemia Low serum iron - Normal (50-170, ug/dI) High serum. ferritin Normal (30-400 ng/ml) High serum transferrin Normal (30-50%) Let's look at the options first Iron deficiency anemia Can be easily ruled out as serum ferritin is low in Iron deficiency anemia. Hemochromatosis Hemochromato. sis is characterized by increased serum iron level. So, we are left with two options - Atransferinemia and DMT1 mutation These are classified in genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia. - Here is a brief discussion on genetic, forms of iron deficiency anemia. Genetic forms of Iron deficiency anemia -Iron deficiency anemia is an acquired disease. It is generally associated with low cost diet and bleeding. - Recent advances in iron metabolism led to the recognition of new entices of iron deficiency anemia in nonbleeding and \"high cost diet\" nourished individuals. These are known as genetic, fonns of iron deficiency anemia. - Apparently rare these genetic. forms of iron deficiency anemia should be recognized by hematologists as they are refractory to classical oral or intravenous iron administration. These includes - Mutations in gene encoding DMT1 - Mutations in gene encoding glutaredoxin 5. - Hypotransferrinemia or Atransferriemia - Deficiency of ceruloplasmin - IRIDA (Iron Recractory, Iron Deficiency Anemia) Genetic forms of Iron deficiency anemia DMT1 Mutation Atransferrinemia Glutaredoxin 5 Aceruloplasminemia Age at diagnosis At bih Late onset Midlife Laic onset Anemia Microcytic hypochromic Microcytic hypochromic Microcytic hypochromic Microctic hypochromic Serum iron High Low High Low Transferrin saturation High High or non measurable High Low Serum ferritin Low or normal fen-itin High High High, o Ringed sideroblasts No No Yes No Liver iron overload Yes Yes Yes Yes Brain damage No No No Yes Hepcidin levels Low et Not y measured Not yet measured Not yet measured Coming back to the question The serum iron indices of the patient match those of Atransferrinemia i. e., low serum iron increased serum ferritn, increased transferring saturation. DMT1 can be ruled out as it has low ferritin level and high iron level. Atransferrinemia Transferrin is an iron carrying protein that transmits iron to the erythroblasts. Atransferrinemia or hypotransferrinemia results in reduced delivery of iron to erythroblasts and development of iron deficient anemia. This leads to massive but. futile iron absorption. The increased iron that is absorbed is not carried to the erythroid cell, instead. it is deposited elsewhere outside of erythroblasts. Iron is deposited in the visceral organs rather than in the bone marrow. DMT Lmutation DMT1 is a tran. smembrane protein involved in dietary nonheme iron uptake at the brush border of duodenal enterocytes and also plays crucial role in iron utilization at the endosomal membrane of the erythroid precursors. In DMT1 mutation the iron absorption in the duodenum continues because the absorption of heme iron is not affected. The mutation primarily affects iron utilization and not absorption. Iron utilization in erythroid precursors is disturbed leading to severe iron deficiency anemia.",

Fibrocystic breasts without any evidence of epithelial changes do not appear to have any significant increased risk of progression to breast cancer.

Normally RBC maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium i. e., with serum that has 0. 9% Na. CI. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic fluid will enter into the cell along osmotic gradiant, eventuallyunder very hypotonic conditions the cell will enlarge to capacity and rupture Osmotic lysis. Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline. Normal red cell begins to lyse at 0. 5% Na. C1 and the hemolysis is complete at 0. 3 Na. Cl. Red blood cells osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occur in a Na. CI concentration > 0-5%. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if the hemolysis is not complete in a 0-3% of Na. CI.",

Frequently, these epitheloid cells fuse to form giant cells in the periphery or some times in the center of granuloma. Pathogenesis of granuloma Immune granuloma (most common type of granuloma) is a type IV hypersensitivity that involved CD-4 helper T cell. On-exposure to paiculate antigen macrophages process and present this antigen to Helper T cells and also secretes IL-2. T-cells are activated on contact with this antigen and by IL-2. Activated T-cells (helper) produce IFN-y, the major cytokine of granulomatous inflammation. IFN-y has the following effects It is the most impoant activator of macrophages. It induce granuloma formation by conversion of activated macrophages into epitheliod cells and formation of giant cell. Augment the differentiation of T-cells. Finally there is formation of granuloma induced by IFN-y. Remember Foreign body (Nonimmune) granuloma consist almost entirely of epitheloid cells and multinucleated giant cells but no lymphocytes. Granulomas induced by parasites contain a large component of eosinophils. In lymphogranuloma venerum and Cat scratch disease granulomas have a characteristic central neutrophilic abscess surrounded by macrophages and other mononuclear cells.",

Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as liver and pancreas. The total body content of the iron is tightly regulated, as the daily losses are matched by gastrointestinal absorption. In hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of intestinal absorption of dietary iron is lost, leading to net iron accumulation of 0. 5 to 1. 0 gm/year. It may be recalled that the total body iron pool ranges from 2-6 gm in normal adults; about 0. 5 gm is stored in the liver 98% of which are hepatocytes. In hemochromatosis, the iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one-third of which accumulates in the liver. The iron accumulation is lifelong, the rate of net iron accumulation is 0. 5 to 1. 0 gm/year. The disease manifests itself typically after 20 gm of storage iron have accumulated. The disease first manifests itself in the fifth to sixth decades of life.

Follicular lymphoma involves the lymph nodes and bone marrow of older people and is characterized by slow, but relentless, growth. Thus, this lymphoma allows a long survival even without any treatment. Indeed, follicular lymphoma is resistant to aggressive therapy because of its low mitotic activity. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a neoplasm of pre-B cells that affects children. Different molecular mechanisms probably account for different cases. Hyperdiploidy, the Philadelphia chromosome, t(12; 21), and t(4; 11) are variably found in patients with ALL. Burkitt lymphoma occurs in different clinical settings, including the African endemic, sporadic non endemic, and AIDS-associated forms. Histologically, all these forms are identical and are derived from neoplastic transformation of B cells expressing surface IgM. Common to all forms are translocations involving the c-myc oncogene (chromosome 8) and Ig loci (chromosome 14). These translocations lead to overexpression of c-myc, which encodes a nuclear transcription protein, resulting in sustained cell replication. The African form is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Multiple myeloma is a neoplasm of terminally differentiated B lymphocytes that secrete large amounts of monoclonal Ig or its fragments (light or heavy chains). Approximately 25% of cases have translocations that lead to overexpression of FGFR3, a receptor for fibroblast growth factor implicated in control of cell proliferation.",

Primary ciliary dyskinesia/PCD/immotile ciliary syndrome/ Kaagener Syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder which causes a defect in the action of the cilia lining the respiratory tract (lower and upper, sinuses, Eustachian tube, middle ear) and fallopian tube. PCD is a genetically heterogenous disorder affecting motile cilia. Around 90% of individuals have ultrastructural defects affecting protein(s) in the outer and/or inner dynein arms which give cilia their motility. When accompanied by the combination of situs inversus (reversal of the internal organs), chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis, it is known as Kaagener syndrome. The main consequence of impaired ciliary function is reduced or absent mucus clearance from the lungs, and susceptibility to chronic recurrent respiratory infections, including sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and otitis media. Infeility is common, due to defective ciliary action in the follopian tube in affected females or diminished sperm motility in affected males.",

ASO titers above 500 Todd units are uncommon in healthy individuals and therefore would serve as evidence of a recent streptococcal infection.

The rate of sickling is influenced by the intracellular concentration of hemoglobin S and by the presence of other hemoglobins within the cell. In Sickle cell trait the low level of HbS is insufficient to produce sickling unless there is profound hypoxia. Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in which an abnormal hemoglobin leads to chronic hemolytic anemia with numerous clinical consequences. It is caused by a single DNA base change leading to an amino acid substitution of valine for glutamine in the sixth position on the beta-globin chain. In Sickle cell disease patients are homozygous and 80% of their hemoglobin is HbS. Hemoglobin S is unstable and polymerizes in the setting of various stressors, including hypoxemia and acidosis, leading to the formation of sickled red blood cells.

Primary amyloidosis is one of the more common forms of systemic amyloidosis, and can affect a variety of organs, including the heart, kidney, peripheral nerve, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract. In primary amyloidosis, the amyloid is composed of immunoglobulin light chains, and the disease is now interpreted as a plasma cell disorder closely related to multiple myeloma. This interpretation is clinically significant, as it has led to modern treatments of primary amyloidosis (which formerly had a dismal prognosis) with the chemotherapies designed for multiple myeloma. The treatments are effective only if the disease is recognized and passed to the appropriate specialists as early as possible in the clinical course. Amyloid AA is seen in inflammation-associated amyloidosis and familial Mediterranean fever. Beta-2-microglobulin comprises the amyloid of dialysis-associated amyloidosis.

When red blood cells with hemogblobin S are exposed to this low oxygen tension they tend to aggregate and polymerize. Sickled cells also express more adhesion molecules and appear more sticky. The sickle cells arrest in the hypoxic vascular bed in the spleen, resulting in a vicious cycle: decrease in 02, sickling and vascular obstruction from thrombus formation. Initially the spleen is enlarged, then progressively becomes smaller. The stasis of flow in the spleen causes hypoxic damage, thrombosis, infarction and fibrosis. In the end the spleen \"disappears\" completely (termed 'autosplenectomy').",

The severity of a-thalassemia varies greatly depending on the number of a-globin genes affected - i) Silent carrier state Single a-globin gene is deleted.

These individuals are asymptomatic with some red cell abnormalities like b-thalassemia minor. iii) HbH disease Three genes of a-globin chain are deleted. With only one gene, the synthesis of a-chain is markedly reduced and tetramers of excess b-globin, called HbH, form. HbH has extremely high affinity for oxygen and therefore is not useful for oxygen exchange, leading to tissue hypoxia dispropoionate to the level of hemoglobin. Patients have moderate to severe anemia that may require occasional blood transfusion. iv) Hydrops fetalis There is deletion of all four a-globin genes. In the fetus, excess y-globin chains form tetramers, known as hemoglobin has. Hemolgobin ba has such a high affinity for oxygen that it delivers almost no oxygen to tissues.

Low back pain and a stretching or pulling sensation are characteristic of ascites in some patients (ascites can also be asymptomatic). The etiology of the fluid accumulation in Meigs syndrome remains a mystery. Ectopic pregnancy would not be associated with hydrothorax. If an ectopic pregnancy ruptured, blood could accumulate in the abdominal cavity, but the patient would likely be hypotensive or dead.

Negri bodies are discrete, intracytoplasmic, deeply eosinophilic inclusions that measure several microns in diameter. In about 75% of cases of rabies these can be seen on hematoxylin and eosin stained sections. They occur in neurons of the brain stem, paicularly those in the hippocampus, and in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Ultrastructural studies have shown that Negri body consists of a mass of nucleocapsids surrounded by viral paicles budding from intracytoplasmic membranes. Those bodies can be seen in axons, and it is in this way that virus spreads from the central nervous system to many organs of the body. Because Negri bodies are usually seen in intact neurons, they are found away from the inflammatory, nonspecific lesions. Rabies viral antigens can be demonstrated in infected cells by means of fluorescent antibody technique. Antigens can be shown to be present in cells in the absence of Negri bodies, and hence this technique is much more sensitive than the search of sections of brain for the pathognomonic cytoplasmic inclusions.",

Transpo of dietry lipid (Exogenous pathway)o It is the transpo of 1 ipid. from intestine to liver. Chylomicrons transpo the dietry lipid from intestine to liver. o In Diet the major lipids are triglyceride and Aolesterol. o Cholesterol is absorbed as such in proximal small intestine and is esterified to cholesteryl ester (ChE). o Triglycerides are hydrolysed by lipases to glycerol and fatty acids which are absorbed in intestine. o Inside intestinal cells triglyceride is synthesized by fatty acids. Chylomicrons are synthesized in the small intestine that contain triglyceride, cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, phospholipids and apoprotein B-48 (apo B-48). o These chylomicrons are secreted in the intestinal lymph and reach the systemic circulation thoracic duct. In the circulation Apo E and Apo C are transfered to chylomicrones by HDL, so now chylomicrons contain Apo B-48, Apo E, & Apo C. o In the circulation, Triglycerides of chylomicrones are hydrolysed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) present on endothelial cells of vessels of skeletal muscles, adipose tissue and heart. o The released fatty acids are utilized locally by these tissues. o The chilomicron paicle progressively shrinks in size by action of LPL and, cholesterol, phospholipids and apo C are transferred to HDL, creating chylomicron remnants that contains more cholesterol, less triglycerides, apo E & apo B-48. o Chylomicron remnants are removed by liver by the LDL receptors that require apo E as ligand. Note - Apo C-II, that is transfered from HDL to chylomicrons act as a cofactor for lipoprotein lipase. Apo A-V promotes LPL mediated triglyceride lipolysis in VLDL and chilomicrons. 2. Transpo of Hepatic lipids (Endogenous pathway)o VLDL is synthesized in liver that contains high triglyceride, ChE, cholesterol, phospholipid and Apo B-100. (VLDL paicles resembel chylomicrones in composition except that VLDL contains Apo B-100 instead of ApoB-48). o VLDL paicles are secreted in the plasma and as with chylomicron, Apo E and Apo C are transferred from HDLto VLDL. Now VLDL contains Apo B-100, Apo E and Apo C. o In plasma, triglycerides of VLDL are hydrolysed by same lipoprotein lipase (see above) and apo C is transferredto HDL and the remmants are called IDL. o 40-60% of IDL is removed by liver LDL receptor mediated endocytosis, this process require Apo E whichacts as ligand for LDL receptors. o Remaining 1 DL is remodeled by hepatic lipase to form LDL that contains maximum cholesterol. o 70% of LDL is removed by liver LDL receptor and 30% is utilized by peripheral tissues as a source ofcholesterol.",

I. Ionizing radiations (UV rays, X-rays) can hydrolyze water into hydroxyl (OH) and hydrogen (H) free radicals. Enzymatic metabolism of exogenous chemicals, e. g., CC14 can generate CC13. The reduction - oxidation reaction during normal metabolic process. During normal respiration, molecular oxygen is sequentially reduced by addition of electron to generate water. In this process small amount of H202, 02- and OH- are produced. o H202 generated, can interact with 02 to generate OH through the Haber-weiss reaction.

Both these are features of X-linked recessive disorders. X-linked disorders Except for a few conditions, all X-linked disorders are X-linked recessive. A male has only one X-chromosome, the male with an affected gene on X-chromosome will always manifest the disease. On the other hand, the female has 2 X-chromosomes, the heterozygous female will be a carrier because of the expression of a normal allele on the other X-chromosome. Note -> Female with Turner syndrome (only one 'X' chromosome) can manifest X-linked recessive disorders. 50% boys of the carrier mother will be affected. All daughters of an affected father will become a carrier, i. e. affected father will transmit the defective X chromosome to all the daughters. Father will not transmit the disease to son as boys do not inherit X-chromosome from father. About other options In X-linked dominant disorder, the females will also manifest the disease.
