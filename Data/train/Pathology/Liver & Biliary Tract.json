Dubin-Johnson syndrome# Hereditary defect in hepatocellular excretion of bilirubin glucuronides across the canalicular membrane due to absence of the canalicular protein, the multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2; located on chromosome 10q24), that isresponsible for transport of bilirubin glucuronides and related organic anions into bile.# The liver is darkly pigmented owing to coarse pigmented granules within the cytoplasm of hepatocytes.# Electron microscopy reveals that the pigment is located in lysosomes, and it appears to be composed of polymers of epinephrine metabolites., not bilirubin pigment.# The liver is otherwise normal.# Apart from chronic /recurrent jaundice (fluctuating intensity), patients are asymptomatic and have normal life span. OTHER HEREDITARY HYPERBILIRUBINEMIASCrigler-Najjar syndrome type I# The enzyme UGT1. A1 is completely absent. 6# The liver is incapable of synthesizing a functional enzyme, and the colorless bile contains only trace amounts of unconjugated bilirubin.# The liver is morphologically normal by light and electron microscopy.# However, serum unconjugated bilirubin reaches very high levels, producing severe jaundice and icterus.# Without liver transplantation, this condition is invariably fatal. Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II# It is a less severe, nonfatal disorder in which UGT1. A1 enzyme activity is greatly reduced, and the enzyme is capable of forming only monoglucuronidated bilirubin.# Almost all patients develop normally and the only major consequence is extraordinarily yellow skin from high levels of circulating unconjugated bilirubin; but there is a risk of neurologic damage from kemicterus.# Phenobarbital improves bilirubin glucuronidation by inducing hypertrophy of hepatic endoplasmic reticulum. Gilbert syndrome# It is a relatively common, benign, somewhat heterogeneous inherited condition presenting with mild, fluctuating hyperbilirubinemia.# Main cause is reduction in hepatic bilirubin glucuronidating activity (UGT1. A1) to about 30% of normal.# Gilbert syndrome has no clinical consequence except for the anxiety. Rotor syndrome# It is a rare form of asymptomatic conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with multiple defects in hepatocellular uptake and excretion of bilirubin pigments.# The liver is not pigmented.# As with Dubin-Johnson syndrome, patients with Rotor syndrome exhibit jaundice but otherwise live normal lives.",

Primary biliary cirrhosis evolves through ductal lesions, scarring, and eventually cirrhosis. Early PBC features chronic destructive cholangitis affecting intrahepatic small and medium-sized bile ducts. The bile ducts are surrounded primarily by lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells), but plasma cells and macrophages are also seen. In some portal tracts, lymphoid follicles are conspicuous. Discrete epithelioid granulomas often occur in the portal tracts and may impinge on the bile ducts. As a result of the destructive chronic inflammatory process, small bile ducts virtually disappear, and scarring of medium-sized bile ducts is common. Proliferation of bile ductules within portal tracts is common and may be florid. Collagenous septae extend from the portal tracts into the lobular parenchyma and encircle some lobules. Cholestasis, when present, may be severe and is located at the periphery of the portal tracts.

The toxic dose of acetaminophen after a single acute ingestion is in the range of 150mg/kg in children and 7 g in adults. Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine and conjugated in the liver to nontoxic agents, which then are eliminated in the urine. In cases of acute overdose, normal pathways of acetaminophen metabolism become saturated. Excess acetaminophen is then metabolized in the liver via the mixed function oxidase P450 system, yielding oxidative metabolites that cause predictable, hepatocellular necrosis.
