        "exp": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be complicated by cerebral amyloid angiopathy and terminal hemorrhagic stroke. Formation and aggregation of the Ap peptide are now considered central to the pathogenesis of AD. Ap peptide is derived from the abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). When APP, a transmembrane protein, is cleaved by a-secretase within the Ap sequence, followed by g-secretases, a soluble nontoxic fragment is formed. Cleavage of the Ap sequence by b-secretase and then g-secretase gives rise to Ap peptides that aggregate and form the amyloid cores that elicit a microglial and astrocytic response to form neuritic plaques. Conformational change in prion protein leads to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, rapidly progressive dementia with spongiform encephalopathy but not neuritic plaques or amyloid deposition. Loss of dopaminergic neurons with a deficiency of dopamine is central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Expansion of polyglutamine repeats owing to CAG trinucleotide repeat-expansion underlies Huntington disease. Although abnormally phosphorylated forms of tau protein are found in neurofibrillary tangles seen in AD, there is no mutation of the tau gene, and the tangles are not considered primary in the pathogenesis of AD.

The mass effect with herniation of the medial temporal lobe results in a third cranial nerve palsy as the nerve is compressed. A chronic subdural hemorrhage accumulates slowly enough that herniation may not occur. An abscess may cause a mass effect with some associated brain swelling, but this patient is afebrile. There is no pressure effect with hydrocephalus ex vacuo, which is a consequence of cerebral atrophy.

On physical examination, her temperature is 38. 3degC. There is no papilledema. She has no loss of sensation or motor function, but there is decreased vision in the left half of her visual fields. CT scan of the head shows a sharply demarcated, 3-cm, a ring-enhancing lesion in the right occipital region. A lumbar puncture is done, and laboratory analysis of the CSF shows numerous leukocytes, increased protein, and normal glucose levels. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "A cerebral abscess is most often a complication of an infection, such as pneumonia or endocarditis, with onset days to weeks earlier. The bacteria spread hematogenously. As the abscess organizes, it is ringed by fibroblasts that deposit collagen; this feature is characteristic of an abscess in the CNS. A neoplasm occasionally may be ring-enhancing, but glioblastoma is an aggressive malignancy that is not well demarcated. Metastases are mass lesions that are typically multifocal. A multiple sclerosis plaques is generally not large, is found in white matter, and does not typically have ring enhancement. An infarct would produce sudden signs and symptoms that improve over time, and the CSF protein would not be increased.",

Meningomyelocele (choice B) exposes the spinal canal and causes the nerve roots to be entrapped. Rachischisis (choice C) is an extreme defect, often without a recognizable spinal cord.
