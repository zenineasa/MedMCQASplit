        "exp": "Cholesteatoma is a complication of chronic suppurative otitis and a rupture of the eardrum. Cholesteatoma is a mass of accumulated keratin and squamous mucosa that results from the growth of squamous epithelium from the external ear canal through the perforated eardrum into the middle ear.

Which of the following organisms is most likely to be associated with development of his oral lesions?",
        "exp": "Periodontitis becomes more prevalent with age, often secondary to the effects of dental plaque formation driven by oral flora. The gingival recession increases the risk for dental caries. Regular dental cleanings to remove the plaque and regular gentle tooth brushing help to slow the progression of periodontitis. Some periodontitis cases arise in the setting of systemic disease. Candidiasis is seen in immunocompromised individuals and often forms an inflammatory membrane on the tongue. Epstein-Barr virus has been associated with development of hairy leukoplakia. Herpes simplex virus results in vesicles that can rupture and form superficial ulcers on oral mucosa. Human papillomavirus can drive squamous epithelial hyperplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma.
