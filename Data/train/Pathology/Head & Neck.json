        "exp": "Cholesteatoma is a complication of chronic suppurative otitis and a rupture of the eardrum. Cholesteatoma is a mass of accumulated keratin and squamous mucosa that results from the growth of squamous epithelium from the external ear canal through the perforated eardrum into the middle ear.

        "question": "A 60-year-old woman noticed an enlarging \"bump\" beneath her tongue for the past year. She does not smoke or use alcohol. On physical examination, there is a 2.5-cm, movable, submucosal mass arising in the minor salivary glands on the buccal mucosa beneath the tongue on the right. Histologic examination of the excised mass shows that it is malignant and locally invasive. The tumor recurs within 1 year. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Mucoepidermoid carcinomas can arise in major and minor salivary glands. They account for most neoplasms that arise within minor salivary glands, particularly malignant neoplasms. Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas may be invasive, but the prognosis is usually good, with a 5-year survival of 90%. High-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas can metastasize and have a 5-year survival of only 50%. Non- Hodgkin lymphomas are found in adjacent cervical lymph nodes or in the Waldeyer ring of lymphoid tissue. A primitive neuroectodermal tumor, also known as an olfactory neuroblastoma, is a small, round, blue cell tumor of childhood; it is likely to arise in the nasopharyngeal region. Pleomorphic adenomas are more common in the major salivary glands than are mucoepidermoid tumors, and they are more likely to be indolent.

Which of the following organisms is most likely to be associated with development of his oral lesions?",
        "exp": "Periodontitis becomes more prevalent with age, often secondary to the effects of dental plaque formation driven by oral flora. The gingival recession increases the risk for dental caries. Regular dental cleanings to remove the plaque and regular gentle tooth brushing help to slow the progression of periodontitis. Some periodontitis cases arise in the setting of systemic disease. Candidiasis is seen in immunocompromised individuals and often forms an inflammatory membrane on the tongue. Epstein-Barr virus has been associated with development of hairy leukoplakia. Herpes simplex virus results in vesicles that can rupture and form superficial ulcers on oral mucosa.
