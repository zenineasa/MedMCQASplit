        "exp": "Ans. a. P. falciparum (Ref: Robbins 9/e p390, 8/e p387). Person having heterozygous sickle cell trait is protected from infection of P. falciparum. \"People who are heterozygous for the sickle cell trait (HbS) become infected with P. falciparum, but they are less likely to die from infectionQ. The HbS trait causes the parasites to grow poorly or die because of the low oxygen concentrationsQ. \"- Robbins 8/e p387. Host Resistance to Plasmodium. Two general mechanisms of host resistance to Plasmodium: Inherited alterations in red cells make people resistant to PlasmodiumQ. Repeated or prolonged exposure to Plasmodium species stimulates an immune response that reduces the severity of the illness caused by malariaQ. People who are heterozygous for the sickle cell trait (HbS) become infected with P. falciparum, but they are less likely to die from infectionQ. The HbS trait causes the parasites to grow poorly or die because of the low oxygen concentrationsQ. The geographic distribution of the HbS trait is similar to that of P. falciparumQ, suggesting evolutionary selection of the HbS trait in people by the parasite. HbC, another common hemoglobin mutation, also protects against severe malaria by reducing parasite proliferationQ. People can also be resistant to malaria due to the absence of proteins to which the parasites bindQ. P. vivax enters red cells by binding to the Duffy blood group antigenQ. Many Africans, including most Gambians, are not susceptible to infection by P. sivax because they do not have the Duffy antigenQ. Antibodies and T lymphocytes specific for Plasmodium reduce disease manifestations. Cytotoxic lymphocytes may also be important in resistance to P. falciparum. In the given image, irregularly shaped large rings and trophozoites are seen with enlarged erythrocytes, which are the characteristic features of Plasmodium vivax.

Howell-Jolly bodies because of autosplenctomy. o A postive sickling test with a reducing substance like sodium metabisulfite. o Sickle cell anemia is caused by replacement of normal Hemoglobin by sickled hemoglobin (HbS). o HbS is formed by replacement of Glutamine by Valine at position 6o This substitution replaces the polar Glutamine residue with a nonpolar Valine. o The replacement of Glutamine by Valine generates a sticky patch on the surface of HBS. o The sticky patch is present on both oxygenated and deoxygenated Hb. So The deoxygenated HbS also contains a complementary site for the sticky patch. o In oxygenated hemoglobin this complementary site is masked. o When HbS is deoxygenated the sticky patch present on its surface binds to the complementary patch on another deoxygenated HbS molecules. o This binding leads to polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin S forming long fibrous precipitates, o These extend throughout the erythrocyte and mechanically distort it, causing lysis and multiple secondary clinical effect. So, if HbS can be maintained in an oxygenated state or if the concentration of deoxygenated HbS can be minimized, formation of these polymers will not occur and sickling can be prevented (Remember the complementary site for the sticky patch remains masked in case of Oxygenated HbS). Role of HbA in polymerization -o Unlike HbS, HbA does not contain any sticky patch, but it does have a binding site for the sticky patch of HbS. o Thus it can bind to HbS through its receptor site but this binding cannot extend the polymer because HbA does not contain any sticky patch to promote binding to still another hemoglobin molecule. o So HbA interferes with the polymerisation and aggreation of HbS and reduces the intensity of sickle cell anemia.",

So, all these cells are sensitive to complement mediated lysis that results in: - - Anemia, Leucopenia, Granulocytopenia, Thrombocytopenia. Clinical features of PNHIntravascular hemolysiso The main feature of PNH is increased intravascular hemolysis that results in -# Hemoglobinemia# Increased urine urobilinogen# Hemoglobinuria# Decreased serum haptoglobin# Hemosiderinuria# Increased serum LDH# Increased serum bilirubin o The hemolysis is paroxysmal and usually occurs in the night because during sleep the pH of blood gets slightly reduced and acidic medium leads to activation of the complement. Thrombosiso In PNH there is epsodic thrombosis due to absence of CD-59 on platelets, this results in extemilization of phosphotidylserine, a site for prothrombinase complexes and thus increase the propensity for thrombosis, o Intrabdominal veins are the most common sites of thrombosis that may result in Budd chiary syndrome due to hepatic vein thrombosis.

Diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuriao Until recently the diagnosis of P. N. H was based on special tests that were based on the principle that P. N. H red cells are susceptible to complement mediated lysis. These tests are: HAM Test. Ham's acidified serum test is one of the screening tests for P. N. H. Patients red cells get lysed in an acidic pH in the presence of complement. Sucrose Test. Red cells lyse on the addition of sucrose and complement in the medium. Addition of sucrose decreases the ionic strength. o But now the diagnosis of P. N. H depends upon analyzing the expression GP. I.-AP on the hematopoietic stem cells using monochonal antibodies and flow cytometry. The simplest method is to analyze the expression of CD59 on erythrocytes. o PNH is diagnosed by flow cytometry, which provides a sensitive means for detecting red cells that are deficient in GPI-linked protein such as CD59.",

        "exp": "Ans. a. Point mutation (Ref: Ghai 7/e p310-312; Harper's 27/e p368-371; Robbins 9/e p635-638, 8/e p646). An afroamerican kid of 6 years of age presented with abdominal pain, chronic hemolysis and abnormal RBC shape on peripheral smear. This patient is suffering from sickle cell anemia. Most likely disorder responsible for this condition point mutation. (AIIMS November 2013 repeat)'Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disease that results from the substitution of valine from glutamic acid at position 6 of the beta-globin gene (Point mutation). - Ghai 7/e p310. Point mutations within coding sequences: A point mutation may alter the code in a triplet of bases and lead to the replacement of one amino acid by another in the gene product. An excellent example of this type is the sickle mutation affecting the B-globin chain of hemoglobinQ. Here the nucleotide triplet CTC (or GAG in m. RNA), which encodes glutamic acid, is changed to CAC (or GUG in m. RNA), which encodes valine. This single amino acid substitution alters the physicochemical properties of hemoglobin, giving rise to sickle cell anemia. Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle cell disease is a common hereditary hemoglobinopathy that occurs primarily in individuals of African descend. Caused by a point mutation in the sixth codon of B-globin that leads to the replacement of a glutamate residue with a valine residueQ. In certain populations in Africa the prevalence of heterozygosity is as high as 30%. This high frequency probably stems from protection afforded by HbS against falciparum malariaQ. Pathogenesis: HbS molecules undergo polymerization when deoxygenated. Initially the red cell cytosol converts from a freely flowing liquid to a viscous gel as HbS aggregates form. With continued deoxygenation aggregated HbS molecules assemble into long needle-like fibers within red cells, producing a distorted sickle or holly-leaf shapeQ. Presence of HbS underlies the major pathologic manifestations. Chronic hemolysis. QMicrovascular occlusions. QTissue damage. QMorphology: Peripheral blood demonstrates variable numbers of irreversibly sickled cells, retieulocytosis, and target cells, Howell-Jolly bodiesQ (small nuclear remnants). The bone marrow is hyperplastic as a result of a compensatory erythroid hyperplasiaQ. Expansion of the marrow leads to bone resorption and secondary new bone formation, resulting in prominent cheekbones and changes in the skull that resemble a crew-cut in x-raysQ. Increased breakdown of hemoglobin can cause pigment gallstones and hyperbilirubinemiaQ. Splenic infarction, fibrosis, and progressive shrinkage (autosplenectomy)Q",
