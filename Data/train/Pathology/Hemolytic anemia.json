        "exp": "Ans. a. P. falciparum (Ref: Robbins 9/e p390, 8/e p387). Person having heterozygous sickle cell trait is protected from infection of P. falciparum. \"People who are heterozygous for the sickle cell trait (HbS) become infected with P. falciparum, but they are less likely to die from infectionQ. The HbS trait causes the parasites to grow poorly or die because of the low oxygen concentrationsQ. \"- Robbins 8/e p387. Host Resistance to Plasmodium. Two general mechanisms of host resistance to Plasmodium: Inherited alterations in red cells make people resistant to PlasmodiumQ. Repeated or prolonged exposure to Plasmodium species stimulates an immune response that reduces the severity of the illness caused by malariaQ. People who are heterozygous for the sickle cell trait (HbS) become infected with P. falciparum, but they are less likely to die from infectionQ. The HbS trait causes the parasites to grow poorly or die because of the low oxygen concentrationsQ. The geographic distribution of the HbS trait is similar to that of P. falciparumQ, suggesting evolutionary selection of the HbS trait in people by the parasite. HbC, another common hemoglobin mutation, also protects against severe malaria by reducing parasite proliferationQ. People can also be resistant to malaria due to the absence of proteins to which the parasites bindQ. P. vivax enters red cells by binding to the Duffy blood group antigenQ. Many Africans, including most Gambians, are not susceptible to infection by P. sivax because they do not have the Duffy antigenQ. Antibodies and T lymphocytes specific for Plasmodium reduce disease manifestations. Cytotoxic lymphocytes may also be important in resistance to P. falciparum. In the given image, irregularly shaped large rings and trophozoites are seen with enlarged erythrocytes, which are the characteristic features of Plasmodium vivax.

Effect of HbS on RBCso In deoxygenated condition, the HbS molecules undergo polymerization and aggregation, o With continued deoxygenation, aggregated HbS molecules assemble into long needle-like fibers writhin red cells, producing a distorted sickle or holly-leaf shape. o Sickling of red cells is reversible initialy, i. e., with oxygenation, HbS depolymerizes and cell shape normalizes, o Howrever, with repeated episodes of deoxygenation and sickling, membrane damage occurs and cells become irreversibly sickled, and retain their abnormal shape even when full oxygenated, o With membrane damage water comes out of the cell resulting in intracellular dehydration -| MCHC. o Due to membrane damage, sickle red cells become abnormally sticky - responsible for microvascular occlusions.

So, all these cells are sensitive to complement mediated lysis that results in: - - Anemia, Leucopenia, Granulocytopenia, Thrombocytopenia. Clinical features of PNHIntravascular hemolysiso The main feature of PNH is increased intravascular hemolysis that results in -# Hemoglobinemia# Increased urine urobilinogen# Hemoglobinuria# Decreased serum haptoglobin# Hemosiderinuria# Increased serum LDH# Increased serum bilirubin o The hemolysis is paroxysmal and usually occurs in the night because during sleep the pH of blood gets slightly reduced and acidic medium leads to activation of the complement. Thrombosiso In PNH there is epsodic thrombosis due to absence of CD-59 on platelets, this results in extemilization of phosphotidylserine, a site for prothrombinase complexes and thus increase the propensity for thrombosis, o Intrabdominal veins are the most common sites of thrombosis that may result in Budd chiary syndrome due to hepatic vein thrombosis. Other featureso Thrombocytopeniao Granulocytopeniao Decreased LAP scoreo Normoblastic hyperplasia of bone marrowo PNH patients are also at increased risk for developing acute myelogenous leukemia and aplastic anemia. Diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuriao Until recently the diagnosis of P. N. H was based on special tests that were based on the principle that P. N. H red cells are susceptible to complement mediated lysis. These tests are: HAM Test. Ham's acidified serum test is one of the screening tests for P. N. H. Patients red cells get lysed in an acidic pH in the presence of complement. Sucrose Test. Red cells lyse on the addition of sucrose and complement in the medium. Addition of sucrose decreases the ionic strength. o But now the diagnosis of P. N. H depends upon analyzing the expression GP. I.-AP on the hematopoietic stem cells using monochonal antibodies and flow cytometry. The simplest method is to analyze the expression of CD59 on erythrocytes. o PNH is diagnosed by flow cytometry, which provides a sensitive means for detecting red cells that are deficient in GPI-linked protein such as CD59.",

An afroamerican kid of 6 years of age presented with abdominal pain, chronic hemolysis and abnormal RBC shape on peripheral smear. This patient is suffering from sickle cell anemia. Most likely disorder responsible for this condition point mutation. (AIIMS November 2013 repeat)'Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disease that results from the substitution of valine from glutamic acid at position 6 of the beta-globin gene (Point mutation). - Ghai 7/e p310. Point mutations within coding sequences: A point mutation may alter the code in a triplet of bases and lead to the replacement of one amino acid by another in the gene product. An excellent example of this type is the sickle mutation affecting the B-globin chain of hemoglobinQ. Here the nucleotide triplet CTC (or GAG in m. RNA), which encodes glutamic acid, is changed to CAC (or GUG in m. RNA), which encodes valine. This single amino acid substitution alters the physicochemical properties of hemoglobin, giving rise to sickle cell anemia. Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle cell disease is a common hereditary hemoglobinopathy that occurs primarily in individuals of African descend. Caused by a point mutation in the sixth codon of B-globin that leads to the replacement of a glutamate residue with a valine residueQ. In certain populations in Africa the prevalence of heterozygosity is as high as 30%. This high frequency probably stems from protection afforded by HbS against falciparum malariaQ. Pathogenesis: HbS molecules undergo polymerization when deoxygenated. Initially the red cell cytosol converts from a freely flowing liquid to a viscous gel as HbS aggregates form. With continued deoxygenation aggregated HbS molecules assemble into long needle-like fibers within red cells, producing a distorted sickle or holly-leaf shapeQ. Presence of HbS underlies the major pathologic manifestations. Chronic hemolysis. QMicrovascular occlusions. QTissue damage. QMorphology: Peripheral blood demonstrates variable numbers of irreversibly sickled cells, retieulocytosis, and target cells, Howell-Jolly bodiesQ (small nuclear remnants). The bone marrow is hyperplastic as a result of a compensatory erythroid hyperplasiaQ. Expansion of the marrow leads to bone resorption and secondary new bone formation, resulting in prominent cheekbones and changes in the skull that resemble a crew-cut in x-raysQ.
