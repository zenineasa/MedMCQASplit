Therefore pancreatic fibrosis impairs exocrine and endocrine functions of pancreas.* Increased production & deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as type I collagen, fibronectin and periostin, is essential for the formation of fibrosis.* Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) are wellknown growth factors activating PSCs* Pancreatic fibrosis also affects the macroscopic ductal structure of the pancreas, typically results in the dilatation of main pancreatic duct or formation of pancreatic stones, derived from inadequate drainage of pancreatic juice.
