In CAA, amyloidogenic peptides, usually the same ones found in Alzheimer disease are deposited in the walls of medium and small caliber meningeal and coical vessels. This deposition can weaken the vessel wall and lead to hemorrhage. Many individuals with CAA have evidence of numerous small hemorrhages within the brain (\"microbleeds\"), which can be visualized by various imaging methods. As with Alzheimer disease, in which there is a relationship between a polymorphism in the gene that encodes apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and risk of disease, there is an effect of the ApoE genotype on the risk of recurrence of hemorrhage from sporadic CAA. The presence of either an e2 or e4 allele increases the risk of repeat bleeding. While some mutations in the precursor protein for the Ab peptide (amyloid precursor protein, APP) cause familial Alzheimer disease, others result in autosomal dominant forms of CAA.",

The most prominent humoral immune abnormalities are defective production of isotype switched antibodies, mainly IgA and Ig. G2. The T cell defects, which are usually less pronounced, are associated with thymic hypoplasia. Patients experience upper and lower respiratory tract bacterial infections, multiple autoimmune phenomena, and increasingly frequent cancers with advancing age. The gene responsible for this disorder is located on chromosome 11 and encodes a protein called ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) that is related structurally tophosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase, but is a protein kinase. The ATM protein is a sensor of DNA damage (doublestrand breaks) and it activates p53 by phosphorylation, which in turn can activate cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis in cells with damaged DNA. ATM has also been shown to contribute to the stability of DNA double-strand break complexes during V(D)J recombination. Because of these abnormalities in DNA repair, the generation of antigen receptors may be abnormal. In addition, defective DNA repair may lead to abnormalities in the DNA recombination events that are involved in antibody iso-type switching.",
