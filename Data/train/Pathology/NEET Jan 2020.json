Subacute (bacterial) endocarditis is caused by less virulent organisms, such as Streptococcus viridans (more than 50% of cases).

The tricuspid valve is involved in more than 50% of cases of endocarditis of intravenous drug users, in whom endocarditis is most often caused by staphylococcal infection. b. Complications Distal embolization occurs when vegetations fragment. Embolization can occur almost anywhere in the body and can result in septic infarcts in the brain or in other organs.

In children, it is also characterized by growth retardation and general failure to thrive. It is more common in patients with Type I diabetes mellitius. Diagnosis involves documentation of malabsorption, small intestinal biopsy demonstrating blunting of small intestinal villi, the presence of Ig-A endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and clinical improvement and restoration of normal intestinal morphology on a gluten-free diet. Incidence increases in association withhuman leukocyte antigens (HLAs) HLA-B8 and HLA-DW3. This finding and the presence of antibodies directed against gliadin (a glycoprotein component of gluten) and transglutaminase suggest that both genetic and immune-mediated mechanisms may be involved. These antibody tests may also be used for screening prior to definitive diagnosis by biopsy. Enteropathy-type t-cell lymphoma develops in a subset of patients. 2.
