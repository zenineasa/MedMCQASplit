        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Tobacco use Leukoplakia (from the Greek, ieukos, \"white\" andplax, \"plaque\")o Is an asymptomatic white lesion on the surface of a mucous membrane that affects both sexes equally, mostly after the third decade of life. o A variety of diseases are characterized by white plaques on the oral mucosa (e. g., candidiasis, lichen planus, psoriasis, syphilis). o Erythroplakia is the red equivalent of leukoplakia but is less common. o Red areas associated with leukoplakic lesions are referred to as speckled leukoplakia (erythroleukoplakia, speckled mucosa). In contrast to leukoplakia, erythroplakia may represent moderate to severe dysplasia or carcinoma. Not all of these lesions herald malignancy, as many may be inflammatory' in natureo Oral Leukoplakia is the most common potentially malignant Lesion of the oral mucosa. It is seen most frequently in middle-aged and older men, with an increasing prevalence with age. Less than one percent of men below the age of 30 years have oral leukoplakia. The etiology is multifactorial but the most common cause associated with oral leukoplakia is tobacco consumption. Thus, we derive that the most common antecedent of either ery throplakia or leukoplakia in India is tobacco use.",
