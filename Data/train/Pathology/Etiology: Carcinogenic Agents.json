In contrast to leukoplakia, erythroplakia may represent moderate to severe dysplasia or carcinoma. Not all of these lesions herald malignancy, as many may be inflammatory' in natureo Oral Leukoplakia is the most common potentially malignant Lesion of the oral mucosa. It is seen most frequently in middle-aged and older men, with an increasing prevalence with age. Less than one percent of men below the age of 30 years have oral leukoplakia. The etiology is multifactorial but the most common cause associated with oral leukoplakia is tobacco consumption.Thus, we derive that the most common antecedent of either ery throplakia or leukoplakia in India is tobacco use.",
