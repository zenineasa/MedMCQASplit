Deatb receptors are members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that contain a cytoplasmic domain involved in protein-protein interactions that is called the death domain because it is essential for delivering apoptotic signals. (Some TNF receptor family members do not contain cytoplasmic death domains; their role in triggering apoptosis is much less established). The best-known death receptors are the type 1 TNF receptor (TNFR1) and a related protein called Fas (CD95), but several others have been described. The mechanism of apoptosis induced by these death receptors is well illustrated by Fas The most well characterized ligands of these receptors to dateane FasL, TNF-atpha, Apo3L, and Apo. ZL. Corresponding receptors are FasR, TN FR1, DR3, and DR4/ D R5, respectively When Fas is cross-1 inked by its ligand, membrane-bound Fas ligand (FasL), three or more molecules of Fas come together, and their cytoplasmic death domains form a binding site for an adapter protein that also contains a death domain and is called FADD (Fas-associated death domain). FADD that is attached to the death receptors in turn binds an inactive form of caspase-8 (and, in humans, caspase-10), again via a death domain. THE INTRINSIC PATHWAY FOR PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH The intrinsic signaling pathway for programmed cell death involves non-receptor-mediated intracellular signals, inducing activities in the mitochondria that initiate apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic proteins activate caspases that mediate the destruction of the cell through many pathways. These proteins also translocate into the cellular nucleus, inducing DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis. The regulation of pro-apoptotic events in the mitochondria occurs through activity of members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins and the tumor suppressor protein p53. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins may be pro- oranti-apoptotic. The anti-apoptotic proteins are Bcl-2, Bcl-x, Bcl-xL, Bcl-XS, Bcl-w, and BAG. Some of these proteins are currently under investigation as potential targets for anti cancer therapy.

        "question": "All are true regarding apoptosis except:",
        "exp": "Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition, Chapter l, Pg: 3. Explanation: Apoptosis. Apoptosis is a pathway of cell death that is induced by a tightly regulated suicide program in which cells destined to die activate enzymes that degrade the cells' own nuclear DMA and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Apoptotic cells break up into fragments, called apoptotic bodies, which contain portions of the cytoplasm and nucleus. The plasma membrane of the apoptotic cell and bodies remains intact, but its structure is altered in such a way that these become ''tasty\" targets for phagocytes. The dead cell and its fragments are rapidly devoured, before the contents have leaked out. and therefore cell death by this pathway does not elicit an inflammatory reaction in the host. Apoptosis is different from Necrosis. Characteristics of Necrosis. Loss of membrane integrity. Enzymatic digestion of cells. Leakage of cellular contents. Inflammatory reaction. However, apoptosis and necrosis sometimes coexist, and apoptosis induced by some pathologic stimuli may progress to necrosis. Morphology of Apoptosis. The following morphologic features, some best seen with the electron microscope, characterize cells undergoing apoptosis. Cell shrinkage. The cell is smaller in size; the cytoplasm is dense; and the organelles, though relatively normal, are more tightly packed. Chromatin condensation. This is the most characteristic feature of apoptosis. The chromatin aggregates peripherally, under the nuclear membrane, into dense masses of various shapes and sizes. The nucleus itself may break up, producing two or more fragments. Formation of cytoplasmic blebs and apoptotic bodies. The apoptotic cell first show s extensive surface blebbing. then undergoes fragmentation into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies composed of cytoplasm and tightly packed organelles, with or without nuclear fragments. Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or cell bodies, usually hv macrophages. The apoptotic bodies are rapidly ingested by phagocytes and degraded by the phagocyte's lysosomal enzymes. Plasma membranes are thought to remain intact during apoptosis, until the last stages, when they become permeable to normally retained solutes. On histologic examination, in tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin, the apoptotic cell appears as a round or oval mass of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm with fragments of dense nuclear chromatin. Because the cell shrinkage and formation of apoptotic bodies are rapid and the pieces are quickly phagocytosed, considerable apoptosis may occur in tissues before it becomes apparent in histologic sections. Apoptosis--(in contrast to necrosis)--does not elicit inflammation, making it more difficult to detect histologically.

A and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The cells plasma membrane remain intact but its structure is altered in such a way that apoptotic cell becomes an avid target for phagocytosis. The dead cell is rapidly cleared before its contents have leaked out, and therefore cell death by this pathway does not elicit an inflammatory reaction in the host. Apoptosis occurs normally in many situations, and serves to eliminate unwanted or potentially harmful cells and cells that have outlived their usefulness. It is also a pathological event in conditions when cells are damaged beyond repair, especially when the damage affect the cell's D. N. A. In these situations the irreparably damaged cell is eliminated. How does apoptosis start? Normally growth factors and other survival signals stimulate the production of antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. There are more than 20 proteins in this family, all of which function to regulate apoptosis. The two main antiapoptotic ones are Bcl-2 and BcL-X. These antiapoptotic proteins normally reside in the mitochondrial membranes and cytoplasm and prevents apoptosis. When cells are deprived of survival signals or subjected to stress, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X are lost from the mitochondrial membranes and are replaced by proapoptotic members o/the family such as Bak, Bax and Bim. This leads to increased permeability of mitochondrial membrane and the release of certain proteins which activate caspases which carries on the process of apoptosis. Proapoptic factors.

Neurons use apoptosis inducing factor located in the space between the mitochondrial membranes and don't use caspase for apoptosis. [?] AIF breaks neuronal DNA. [?] AIF is induced by HSP-70[?] It also acts as an NADH oxidase. Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) is a protein that triggers chromatin condensation and DNA degradation in a cell in order to induce programmed cell death. The mitochondrial AIF protein was found to be a caspase-independent death effector that can allow independent nuclei to undergo apoptotic changes. The process triggering apoptosis starts when the mitochondrion releases AIF, which exits through the mitochondrial membrane, enters the cytosol, and finally ends up in the cell nucleus where it signals the cell to condense its chromosomes and fragment its DNA molecules in order to prepare for cell death. Recently, researchers have discovered that AIF is in fact dependent upon the type of cell, the apoptotic insult, and its DNA binding ability. AIF also plays a significant role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain as well as in metabolic redox reaction",

Caspases are central to the pathogenesis of apoptosis. The process of apoptosis is divided into two phases: i) Initiation phase - During this phase caspases become catalytically activeii) Execution phase - During this phase caspases act to cause cell death. i) Initiation phase of apoptosis# Initiation of apoptosis occurs principally by signals from distinct but convergent pathways. A) Intrinsic (mitochondrial pathway)o In a healthy cell, the outer membrane of its mitochondria displays the proteins BC1-2 and BC1-X. These proteins are antiapoptotic, i. e., they inhibit apoptosis. Internal damage to the cell (e. g., from reactive oxygen species, stress) causes migration of proapoptotic proteins (BaK, Bax and Bim) to the outer membrane of mitochondria at the same time antiapoptotic proteins (BC1-2, BC1-X) are lost from the mitochondrial membrane. o This leads to increase permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. Cytochrome 'C' leaks out from the mitochondria. The released cytochrome 'C' binds to Apaf-1 (apoptosis activating factor-1) in the cytoplasm. These complexes aggregate to from apoptosomes. The apoptosomes bind to an activate Caspase - 9 (initiate caspase). B) Extrinsic or Death receptor pathwayo This pathway is initiated by expression of cell surface death receptors on variety of cells. Death receptors are members of tumor necrosis factor receptor family. The receptors are TNF receptor Type 1(TNFR - 1) and Fas (CD-95). Binding of the complementory death activator, e. g., Fas ligand (Fas L) to Fas and TNF to TNFR-1, transmits a signal to the cytoplasm. o This leads to activation of caspase - 8 (another initiate caspase like caspase - 9). This pathway can be inhibited by an antipoptotic protein FLIP, which can bind to inactive caspases (procaspases) and prevent their activation. So, the final result of both the pathways that is extrinsic receptor mediated pathway and intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is the same i. e. activation of the caspase. ii) Execution phase of apoptosis# In this phase, initiate caspases (Caspase - 8 & 9) activate other caspases known as execution Caspases (Caspases- 3 & 7). After being activated the caspases act on many cellular components.# They cleave cytoskeletal and nuclear matrix proteins and thus disrupts the cytoskeleton. They also lead to the breakdown of the nucleus. In the nucleus the target of caspase activation includes proteins involved in transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair. Caspases activates endonucleases (DNAases) that causes double-stranded breaks in DNA.",

But, most approximate answer would be apoptosis. Caspases, or cysteine-aspartic proteases or cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases are a family of cysteine proteases that play essential roles in apoptosis (programmed cell death), necrosis, and inflammation. Biochemical Features of Apoptosis. Activation of Caspases. A specific feature of apoptosis is the activation of several members of a family of cysteine proteases named caspases. The term caspase is based on two properties of this family of enzymes: the \"c\" refers to a cysteine protease (i. e., an enzyme with cysteine in its active site), and \"aspase'' refers to the unique ability of these enzymes to cleave after aspartic acid residues. The caspase family, now1 including more than 10 members, can be divided functionally into two groups--initiator and executioner-- depending on the order in which they are activated during apoptosis. Initiator caspases include caspase-8 and caspase-9. Several other caspases, including caspase-3 and caspase-6, serve as executioners. Like many proteases, caspases exist as inactive pro-enzymes, or zymogens, and must undergo an enzymatic cleavage to become active. The presence of cleaved, active caspases is a marker for cells undergoing apoptosis.",
