The function of the protein is unknown; however, annexin A5 has been proposed to play a role in the inhibition of blood coagulation by competing for phosphatidylserine binding sites with prothrombin and also to inhibit the activity of phospholipase A1. Antibodies directed against annexin A5 are found in patients with a disease called the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a thrombophilic disease associated with auto antibodies against phospholipid compounds.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e. Bcl-X Apoptosis is a pathway of cell death that is induced by a tightly regulated intracellular programme in which cells destined to die activate enzymes that degrade the cells own nuclear D. N. A and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The cells plasma membrane remain intact but its structure is altered in such a way that apoptotic cell becomes an avid target for phagocytosis. The dead cell is rapidly cleared before its contents have leaked out, and therefore cell death by this pathway does not elicit an inflammatory reaction in the host. Apoptosis occurs normally in many situations, and serves to eliminate unwanted or potentially harmful cells and cells that have outlived their usefulness. It is also a pathological event in conditions when cells are damaged beyond repair, especially when the damage affect the cell's D. N. A. In these situations the irreparably damaged cell is eliminated. How does apoptosis start? Normally growth factors and other survival signals stimulate the production of antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. There are more than 20 proteins in this family, all of which function to regulate apoptosis. The two main antiapoptotic ones are Bcl-2 and BcL-X. These antiapoptotic proteins normally reside in the mitochondrial membranes and cytoplasm and prevents apoptosis. When cells are deprived of survival signals or subjected to stress, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X are lost from the mitochondrial membranes and are replaced by proapoptotic members o/the family such as Bak, Bax and Bim. This leads to increased permeability of mitochondrial membrane and the release of certain proteins which activate caspases which carries on the process of apoptosis. Proapoptic factors.

Neurons use apoptosis inducing factor located in the space between the mitochondrial membranes and don't use caspase for apoptosis. [?] AIF breaks neuronal DNA. [?] AIF is induced by HSP-70[?] It also acts as an NADH oxidase. Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) is a protein that triggers chromatin condensation and DNA degradation in a cell in order to induce programmed cell death. The mitochondrial AIF protein was found to be a caspase-independent death effector that can allow independent nuclei to undergo apoptotic changes. The process triggering apoptosis starts when the mitochondrion releases AIF, which exits through the mitochondrial membrane, enters the cytosol, and finally ends up in the cell nucleus where it signals the cell to condense its chromosomes and fragment its DNA molecules in order to prepare for cell death. Recently, researchers have discovered that AIF is in fact dependent upon the type of cell, the apoptotic insult, and its DNA binding ability. AIF also plays a significant role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain as well as in metabolic redox reaction",

The mitochondrial pathway leads to activation of the initiator caspase-9, and the death receptor pathway to the initiator caspases-8 and 10. After an initiator caspase is cleaved to generate its active form, the enzymatic death program is set in motion by rapid and sequential activation of the executioner caspases. Executioner caspases, such as caspase-3 and 6, act on many cellular components. Cleave an inhibitor of a cytoplasmic DNase and thus make the DNase enzymatically active; this enzyme induces cleavage of DNA. Caspases also degrade structural components of the nuclear matrix and thus promote fragmentation of nuclei.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Caspases o Apoptosis is induced by a cascade of molecular events that may be initiated in distinct ways but culminate in the activation of caspases. Caspases are central to the pathogenesis of apoptosis. The process of apoptosis is divided into two phases: i) Initiation phase - During this phase caspases become catalytically activeii) Execution phase - During this phase caspases act to cause cell death. i) Initiation phase of apoptosis# Initiation of apoptosis occurs principally by signals from distinct but convergent pathways. A) Intrinsic (mitochondrial pathway)o In a healthy cell, the outer membrane of its mitochondria displays the proteins BC1-2 and BC1-X. These proteins are antiapoptotic, i. e., they inhibit apoptosis. Internal damage to the cell (e. g., from reactive oxygen species, stress) causes migration of proapoptotic proteins (BaK, Bax and Bim) to the outer membrane of mitochondria at the same time antiapoptotic proteins (BC1-2, BC1-X) are lost from the mitochondrial membrane. o This leads to increase permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. Cytochrome 'C' leaks out from the mitochondria. The released cytochrome 'C' binds to Apaf-1 (apoptosis activating factor-1) in the cytoplasm. These complexes aggregate to from apoptosomes. The apoptosomes bind to an activate Caspase - 9 (initiate caspase). B) Extrinsic or Death receptor pathwayo This pathway is initiated by expression of cell surface death receptors on variety of cells. Death receptors are members of tumor necrosis factor receptor family. The receptors are TNF receptor Type 1(TNFR - 1) and Fas (CD-95). Binding of the complementory death activator, e. g., Fas ligand (Fas L) to Fas and TNF to TNFR-1, transmits a signal to the cytoplasm. o This leads to activation of caspase - 8 (another initiate caspase like caspase - 9). This pathway can be inhibited by an antipoptotic protein FLIP, which can bind to inactive caspases (procaspases) and prevent their activation. So, the final result of both the pathways that is extrinsic receptor mediated pathway and intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is the same i. e. activation of the caspase. ii) Execution phase of apoptosis# In this phase, initiate caspases (Caspase - 8 & 9) activate other caspases known as execution Caspases (Caspases- 3 & 7). After being activated the caspases act on many cellular components.# They cleave cytoskeletal and nuclear matrix proteins and thus disrupts the cytoskeleton. They also lead to the breakdown of the nucleus. In the nucleus the target of caspase activation includes proteins involved in transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair. Caspases activates endonucleases (DNAases) that causes double-stranded breaks in DNA.",

        "exp": "Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease; 8th edition, Chapter I, Pg: 3. Explanation: Caspases play a vital role in all the four options. But, most approximate answer would be apoptosis. Caspases, or cysteine-aspartic proteases or cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases are a family of cysteine proteases that play essential roles in apoptosis (programmed cell death), necrosis, and inflammation. Biochemical Features of Apoptosis. Activation of Caspases. A specific feature of apoptosis is the activation of several members of a family of cysteine proteases named caspases. The term caspase is based on two properties of this family of enzymes: the \"c\" refers to a cysteine protease (i. e., an enzyme with cysteine in its active site), and \"aspase'' refers to the unique ability of these enzymes to cleave after aspartic acid residues. The caspase family, now1 including more than 10 members, can be divided functionally into two groups--initiator and executioner-- depending on the order in which they are activated during apoptosis. Initiator caspases include caspase-8 and caspase-9. Several other caspases, including caspase-3 and caspase-6, serve as executioners. Like many proteases, caspases exist as inactive pro-enzymes, or zymogens, and must undergo an enzymatic cleavage to become active. The presence of cleaved, active caspases is a marker for cells undergoing apoptosis.",
