        "exp": "Ans. a (Defects in phagolysosome function) (Ref. H - 17th/pg. Table 61-4)CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS DISEASEChronic Granulomatous Disease presents before the age of 2 and can be transmitted through X-linked or autosomal pattern of inheritance. The defect lies in the inability to generate oxidative burst to kill organisms after being phagocytosed. The neutrophils lack enzyme NADPH oxidase, which plays an important role in production of microbicidal oxygen radicles. In the lab, the diagnosis can be confirmed through Nitro blue Tetrazolium reduction dye test, which will be negative. B cell and T cell functions are normal. Recurrent infections with catalase producing organisms are common. The NBT test is a measure of the respiratory burst in neutrophils and is used to screen for CGD. Neutrophils will reduce the dye NBT, a clear yellow water-soluble compound, to formazan upon stimulation of the respiratory burst. Formazan thus forms precipitates as a dark blue granular substance, which remains trapped in the cytoplasm. Patients with CGD lack a component of the oxidase system, which produces super oxide anion and thus cannot reduce NBT to formazan. Results are interpreted as follows: Normal (positive test) - cells with an orange-red nucleus and blue cytoplasm; Abnormal (negative test) - cells with an orange-red nucleus and colorless cytoplasm. Phagocytic cell deficiency: Leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome (type 1): Defect in LFA-1 integrin proteins on phagocytes. Presents early with recurrent bacterial infections, absent pus formation, and delayed separation of umbilicus. Chediak-Higashi disease: Autosomal recessive. Defect in microtubular function and lysosomal emptying of phagocytic cells. Presents with recurrent pyogenic infections by staphylococci and streptococci, partial albinism, and peripheral neuropathy. Chronic granulomatous disease: Defect in phagocytosis of neutrophils owing to lack of NADPH oxidase activity or similar enzymes. Presents with marked susceptibility to opportunistic infections with bacteria, especially S. aureus, E. coli, and Aspergillus. Diagnosis confirmed with negative nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction test. Rx: Gamma Interferon. Inherited Disorders of Phagocyte Function: Differential Features. Clinical manifestations. Cellular or molecular defects. Diagnosis. Chronic Granulomatous Diseases (70% X-linked, 30% Autosomal Recessive). Severe infections of skin, ears, lungs, liver, and bone with catalase-positive microorganisms. Such as S. aureus, Burkholderia. Chromobacterium violaceum; often hard to culture organism; excessive inflammation with granulomas, frequent lymph node suppuration; granulomas can obstruct GI or GU tracts; gingivitis, aphthous ulcers, seborrheic dermatitis.

No myeloperoxidase due to pre- and posttranslational defects. No peroxidase in neutrophils; genetic detection. Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency. Type 1: Delayed separation of umbilical cord, sustained neutrophilia, recurrent infections of skin and mucosa, gingivitis, periodontal disease. Impaired phagocyte adherence, aggregation, spreading, chemotaxis, phagocytosis of C3bi-coated particles; defective production of CD18 subunit common to leukocyte integrins. Reduced phagocyte surface expression of the CD18-containing integrins with monoclonal antibodies against LFA-1 (CD18/CD11a), Mac-1 or CR3 (CD18/CD11b), pl50, 95 (CD1S/ CD11c); genetic detection.

        "exp": "D. B cell defect. Di. George Syndrome {Thymic Hypoplasia) Robbins 9th/24l. Di. George syndrome is a T-cell deficiency that results from failure of development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. The latter give rise to the thymus, the parathyroids, some of the C cells of the thyroid, and the ultimobranchial body. Thus, individuals with this syndrome have a variable loss of T cell-mediated immunity (resulting from hypoplasia or lack of the thymus), tetany (resulting from lack of the parathyroids), and congenital defects of the heart and great vessels. Absence of cell-mediated immunity is caused by low numbers of T lymphocytes in the blood and lymphoid tissues and poor defense against certain fungal and viral infections. The T-cell zones of lymphoid organs--paracortical areas of the lymph nodes and the periarteriolar sheaths of the spleen--are depleted. Ig levels may be normal or reduced, depending on the severity of the T-cell deficiency. \"Patients who survives the neonatal period show enhanced susceptibility to viral, fungal and bacterial infections, which ultimately prove fatal\"- Ananthanarayan 10th/175. Patients with DGS may have poor T-cell production compared to their peers, and as a result, have an increased susceptibility to viral, fungal and bacterial infections- primaryimmune. org. Di.

        "exp": "Ans. is. 'a' i. e., Helper cells * T-cells constitutes 60%-70% of the circulating peripheral lymphocytes. Based on their surface markers, target cells and functions the following T cell category have been identified:-A) Helper T-cells (Inducer T-cells)# These cells constitute 60% of total T-cells. These have CD4 surface marker and bind to MHC class II (MHC class II restricted). There are following types of CD4 cells (Helper T-cells):-1) Effector cells (Effector CD4 helper T-cells)* There are divided into:-i) TH-1 cells# These are activated by IFN-y and themselves produce IL-2, IFN-y and IL-12. These are the primary cells involved in delayed hypersensitivity, cell mediated immunity, macrophage activation and killing of intracellular microbes (M. tuberculosis, M. leprae).# These cells also induce destruction of target cells by activating T-cells to become cytotoxic T-cells and by activating NK cells. ii) TH-2 cells# These are activated by IL-4 and themselves produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13. These cells facilatate synthesis of all antiboides except Ig. G2 b. These cells induce synthesis of IgE more efficiently and cause activation of mast cells and eosinophils. Therefore these cells provide defence against Helminthic parasites. iii) TH-17 cells# These cells are powerful recruiters of neutrophils and monocytes to play a role in severe inflammatory diseases. These cells produce IL-17, IL-22 and chemokines which recruit neutrophils and monocytes. TH-17 cells produce IL-21, which amplifies the TH-17 (self) response. 2) Memory cells (Memory CD4 helper T-cells)* Provide memory, i. e., retain the antigenic affinity of the originally activated T cells and are used to act as later effector cells during a second immune response. B) Cytotoxic T-cells (Cytolytic T-cells)# These cells constitute 30% of total T-cells. These cells have CD8 surface marker and are MHC class I restricted.# They kill and lyse target cells including tumor cells, virus infected cells and allograft; and participate in type II Hypersensitivity. C) Suppressor T-cells# These cells have CD8 surface marker and are MHC class I restricted. These cells down regulate immune response.",

        "exp": "Ans. b (Type II) (Ref. Robbin's pathology 8th ed., Table no. 5-1; p. 121). Hypersensitivity Type IAnaphylactic and atopic - antigen cross-links IgE on presensitized mast cells and basophils, triggering release of vasoactive amines (i. e., histamine). Reaction develops rapidly after antigen exposure due to preformed antibody. E. g. include anaphylaxis, asthma, hives, local wheal and flare. First and Fast (anaphylaxis). Type I, II and Ml are all antibody mediated. Type IIAntibody mediated - IgM, IgG bind to antigen on \"enemy\" cell, leading to lysis (by complement) or phagocytosis. E. g. include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Rh disease (erythroblastosis fetalis), Goodpasture's syndrome, rheumatic fever, Graves' disease, bullous pemphigoid, myasthenia gravis, ITP. Cy-2-toxic. Antibody and complement lead to membrane attack complex (MAC). Type IIIImmune complex - antigen-antibody complexes activate complement, which attracts neurophils; neurophils release lysosomal enzymes. Examples include PAN, immune complex GN/PSGN, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis. Serum sickness - an immune complex disease (type III) in which antibodies to the foreign proteins are produced (takes 5 days). Immune complex form and are deposited in membranes where they fix complement (leads to tissue damage). More common than Arthus reaction. Arthus reaction - a local subacute antibody-mediated hypersensitivity (type Ml) reaction. Intradermal injection of antigen induces antibodies, which form antigen-antibody complexes in the skin. Characterised by edema, necrosis, and activation of complement. E. g. hypersensitivity pneumonitis (farmer's lung), thermophilic actinomycetes. Imagine an immune complex as 3 things stuck together; antigen-antibody- complement. Most serum sickness is now caused by drugs (not serum). Fever, urticaria, proteinuria, arthralgias, lymphadenopathy 5-10 days after antigen exposure. Antigen-antibody complexes cause the Arthus reaction. Type IVDelayed (T-cell mediated) type - sensitized T lymphocytes encounter antigen and then release lymphokines (leads to macrophage activation). 4th and last - delayed. Cell mediated; therefore, it is not transferable by serum, e. g. 4 T's = T lymphocytes, Transplant rejection (GVHD), TB skin tests (PPD), Touching (contact dermatitis). Anaphylactic and Atopic.

There are following types of CD4 cells (Helper T-cells):-1) Effector cells (Effector CD4 helper T-cells)* There are divided into:-i) TH-1 cells# These are activated by IFN-y and themselves produce IL-2, IFN-y and IL-12. These are the primary cells involved in delayed hypersensitivity, cell mediated immunity, macrophage activation and killing of intracellular microbes (M. tuberculosis, M. leprae).# These cells also induce destruction of target cells by activating T-cells to become cytotoxic T-cells and by activating NK cells. ii) TH-2 cells# These are activated by IL-4 and themselves produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13. These cells facilatate synthesis of all antiboides except Ig. G2 b. These cells induce synthesis of IgE more efficiently and cause activation of mast cells and eosinophils. Therefore these cells provide defence against Helminthic parasites. iii) TH-17 cells# These cells are powerful recruiters of neutrophils and monocytes to play a role in severe inflammatory diseases. These cells produce IL-17, IL-22 and chemokines which recruit neutrophils and monocytes. TH-17 cells produce IL-21, which amplifies the TH-17 (self) response. 2) Memory cells (Memory CD4 helper T-cells)* Provide memory, i. e., retain the antigenic affinity of the originally activated T cells and are used to act as later effector cells during a second immune response. B) Cytotoxic T-cells (Cytolytic T-cells)# These cells constitute 30% of total T-cells.

        "question": "During heterosexual intercourse, seminal fluid containing HIV contacts vaginal squamous mucosa. Cells capture virions and transport the virus via lymphatics to regional lymph nodes. Within the germinal centers of these lymph nodes, the virions infect CD4+ lymphocytes and proliferate, causing CD4+ cell lysis with release of more virions, which are taken up on the surface of cells having Fc receptors, allowing continued infection by HIV of more CD4+ cells passing through the nodes. Which of the following types of cells is most likely to capture HIV on its surface via Fc receptors?",
        "exp": "Dendritic cells are a form of antigen-presenting cell. Dendritic cells in epithelia are known as Langerhans cells, and those within germinal centers are called follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). The FDCs may become infected but not killed by HIV. They have cell surface Fc receptors that capture antibody-coated HIV virions through the Fc portion of the antibody. These virions attached to the FDCs can infect passing CD4+ lymphocytes. Dendritic cells elaborate type I interferons that up-regulate antiviral proteins in neighboring cells. B cells are a component of humoral immunity, and antibody to HIV does not serve a protective function, but allows serologic detection of infection. CD8+ cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that lack the receptor necessary for infection by HIV. Because they survive selectively, the CD4+: CD8+ ratio is reversed so that it is typically less than 1 with advanced HIV infection. Innate lymphoid cells resemble NK cells, but shape further lymphoid reactions. Langhans giant cells are \"committees\" of activated macrophages that are part of a granulomatous response. Macrophages are a type of antigen- presenting cell that can become infected by HIV without destruction. Mast cells have surface-bound IgE, which can be cross-linked by antigens (allergens) to cause degranulation and release of vasoactive amines, such as histamine, as part of anaphylaxis with type I hypersensitivity.",
