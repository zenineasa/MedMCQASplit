        "exp": "Cyclooxygenase. Arachidonic acid is metabolized by cyclooxygenases (COX-1, COX-2) and lipoxygenases (5-LOX) to generate prostanoids and leukotrienes, respectively. The early inflammatory prostanoid response is COX-1 dependent. COX-2 becomes the major source of prostanoids as inflammation progresses. Inhibition of COX is one mechanism by which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, indomethacin, and ibuprofen, exert their potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. NSAIDs block COX-2-induced formation of prostaglandins, thereby mitigating pain and inflammation. Myeloperoxidase (choice B) catalyzes the conversion of H2 O2, in the presence of a halide (e. g., chloride ion) to form hypochlorous acid. This powerful oxidant is a major bactericidal agent produced by phagocytic cells. Superoxide dismutase (choice E) reduces the superoxide radical to H2 O2. Diagnosis: Gonococcal arthritis",

        "exp": "Exudation of fluid from venules and capillaries is a key component of the acute inflammatory process. Several mechanisms of increased vascular permeability have been proposed, including formation of interendothelial gaps by contraction of endothelium. This contraction can be caused by mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes. The vessels then become more \"leaky, \" and the fluid leaves the intravascular space to accumulate extravascularly, forming effusions in body cavities or edema within tissues. Arteriolar vasoconstriction is a transient response to injury that helps diminish blood loss. Platelets adhere to damaged endothelium and promote hemostasis. Lymphatic obstruction results in the accumulation of protein-rich lymph and lymphocytes, producing a chylous effusion within a body cavity. After neutrophils reach the site of tissue injury outside of the vascular space, they release lysosomal enzymes that promote liquefaction.",
