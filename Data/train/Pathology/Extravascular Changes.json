Chemotaxis:-It is movement or migration of cell from from one place to another, eg, Migration of Neutrophils during inflammation Diapedesis:-Passage of blood cells through the intact walls of capillaries, eg, WBC at inflammed site.

        "exp": "C-X-C chemokines have one amino acid residue separating the first two of the four conserved cysteine residues. It is induced by microbial products and other cytokines, mainly IL-1 and TNF. These chemokines act on neutrophils primarily. IL 8 is typical of this group. It is secreted by activated macrophages, endothelial cells, and other cell types, and causes activation and chemotaxis of neutrophils, with limited activity on monocytes and eosinophils 1. C-X-C chemokines have one amino acid residue separating the first two of the four conserved cysteines Example: IL-8 2. C-C chemokines have the first two conserved cysteine residues adjacent. Example: monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1, CCL2), eotaxin (CCL11), and macrophage inflammatory protein- 1a (MIP-1a, CCL3), mainly serve as chemoattractants for monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes 3. C chemokines lack the first and third of the four conserved Cysteines. Example: lymphotactin, XCL1 are relatively specific for lymphocytes. 4. CX3C chemokines contain three amino acids between the first two cysteines. Example: fractalkine (CX3. CL1)",
