        "exp": "Pyroptosis is a form of apoptosis that is accompanied by the release of the fever-inducing cytokine IL-1 (pyro refers to fever). Microbial products that enter infected cells are recognized by cytoplasmic innate immune receptors and can activate the multiprotein complex called the inflammasome. The function of the inflammasome is to activate caspase-1 (also known as interleukin-1b-conveing enzyme), which cleaves a precursor form of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and releases its biologically active form. IL-1 is a mediator of many aspects of inflammation, including leukocyte recruitment and fever.",
