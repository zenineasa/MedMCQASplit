        "question": "A 40-year-old, moderately obese man presents with a persistent productive cough. The cough has been present for several weeks, but recently the man noted that his sputum has assumed a greenish color. Fuher questioning elicits a history of productive cough, usually in the winter months, over the past several years. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes per day since he was 16 years old. On examination, the man is febrile (100deg F), and coarse rhonchi and wheezes can be appreciated bilaterally. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "The diagnosis of chronic bronchitis requires the presence of chronic productive cough for over at least 3 months of the year for 2 successive years. The symptoms in this patient (green productive sputum, fever) suggest that he has an acute infection superimposed on chronic bronchitis (history of cigarette smoking, history of excessive mucus production over many years). Histologically, the mucus-producing glands in the bronchi would show hyperplasia and hyperophy and extend to a greater depth in the bronchial wall, resulting in a higher Reid index (ratio of thickness of mucus gland to thickness of bronchial wall). Although the patient is a smoker and is at increased risk for bronchogenic carcinoma, this is unlikely to be the cause of his symptoms. Hemoptysis and weight loss might also be present if he had cancer. Cystic fibrosis presents earlier in life and may be associated with severe production of mucus, especially if bronchiectasis supervenes. The age of the patient and the relative late onset of disease preclude this diagnosis. This patient may also have emphysema, as chronic bronchitis and emphysema are often coexistent. However, although pure emphysema might cause dyspnea, it would not be associated with a fever or a productive cough. Ref: Tallman T. A. (2011). Chapter 67.

        "question": "The surgical specimen is sent fresh from the surgical suite to the laboratory for frozen section examination. Before cutting into the specimen, the pathologist makes a careful gross examination, which demonstrates that most of the specimen has replacement of the normally fatty breast tissue with strands of dense, white, firm tissue. In a few areas, roughly spherical lesions up to 3-cm diameter with a bluish hue to them are seen. Palpation of these areas produces a fluctuant sensation. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis based on the gross evaluation?",
        "exp": "While a careful pathologist will wait for appropriate frozen or permanent tissue histologic examination, the description given in the question stem is most suggestive of fibrocystic disease. The fibrous pa of the lesion forms the dense, white tissue strands, while the blue lesions are what are called \"blue-domed cysts\". The blue color comes from the presence of darkly colored fluid (which usually means old hemorrhage) within the cyst. The interior cyst wall is usually smooth. These blue-domed cysts are a ourite of examiners because they produce a distinctive gross picture and should be specifically associated with fibrocystic disease, but you should be aware that in real life they do not occur with anything near the frequency of fibrocystic disease without obvious large cysts grossly (but many smaller cysts on microscopic examination). Fibrocystic disease of the breast is a very common lesion, and a frequent source of palpable lumps in the breast, which may require fuher evaluation through either excisional biopsy (as in this case), Tru-cut needle biopsy (producing a thin core about 1 cm long), or needle aspiration (producing fluid or cells for cytology). Also know: While a diagnosis of breast cancer should obviously be confirmed microscopically before telling the clinician, invasive breast cancer can be suspected when there is a hard, white, nodular area of the breast that has irregular (but often reasonably well-defined - in contrast to the fibrotic areas of fibrocystic disease) boundaries. The changes of pregnancy cannot be reliably picked up on gross examination of the breast. Fibroadenoma, like breast cancer, tends to produce a well-defined mass lesion, but it typically has smooth borders and may have a slightly gray and slightly mucoid (e. g., shiny or oily appearing) surface on cross-section.

Microcytic hypochromic anemia Low serum iron - Normal (50-170, ug/dI) High serum. ferritin Normal (30-400 ng/ml) High serum transferrin Normal (30-50%) Let's look at the options first Iron deficiency anemia Can be easily ruled out as serum ferritin is low in Iron deficiency anemia. Hemochromatosis Hemochromato. sis is characterized by increased serum iron level. So, we are left with two options - Atransferinemia and DMT1 mutation These are classified in genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia. - Here is a brief discussion on genetic, forms of iron deficiency anemia. Genetic forms of Iron deficiency anemia -Iron deficiency anemia is an acquired disease. It is generally associated with low cost diet and bleeding. - Recent advances in iron metabolism led to the recognition of new entices of iron deficiency anemia in nonbleeding and \"high cost diet\" nourished individuals. These are known as genetic, fonns of iron deficiency anemia. - Apparently rare these genetic. forms of iron deficiency anemia should be recognized by hematologists as they are refractory to classical oral or intravenous iron administration. These includes - Mutations in gene encoding DMT1 - Mutations in gene encoding glutaredoxin 5. - Hypotransferrinemia or Atransferriemia - Deficiency of ceruloplasmin - IRIDA (Iron Recractory, Iron Deficiency Anemia) Genetic forms of Iron deficiency anemia DMT1 Mutation Atransferrinemia Glutaredoxin 5 Aceruloplasminemia Age at diagnosis At bih Late onset Midlife Laic onset Anemia Microcytic hypochromic Microcytic hypochromic Microcytic hypochromic Microctic hypochromic Serum iron High Low High Low Transferrin saturation High High or non measurable High Low Serum ferritin Low or normal fen-itin High High High, o Ringed sideroblasts No No Yes No Liver iron overload Yes Yes Yes Yes Brain damage No No No Yes Hepcidin levels Low et Not y measured Not yet measured Not yet measured Coming back to the question The serum iron indices of the patient match those of Atransferrinemia i. e., low serum iron increased serum ferritn, increased transferring saturation. DMT1 can be ruled out as it has low ferritin level and high iron level. Atransferrinemia Transferrin is an iron carrying protein that transmits iron to the erythroblasts. Atransferrinemia or hypotransferrinemia results in reduced delivery of iron to erythroblasts and development of iron deficient anemia. This leads to massive but. futile iron absorption. The increased iron that is absorbed is not carried to the erythroid cell, instead. it is deposited elsewhere outside of erythroblasts. Iron is deposited in the visceral organs rather than in the bone marrow. DMT Lmutation DMT1 is a tran. smembrane protein involved in dietary nonheme iron uptake at the brush border of duodenal enterocytes and also plays crucial role in iron utilization at the endosomal membrane of the erythroid precursors. In DMT1 mutation the iron absorption in the duodenum continues because the absorption of heme iron is not affected. The mutation primarily affects iron utilization and not absorption. Iron utilization in erythroid precursors is disturbed leading to severe iron deficiency anemia.",

        "exp": "The patient is suffering from multiple myeloma, a neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells (or their precursors) found within the bone marrow. These malignant cells are responsible for the production of excessive amounts of immunoglobulin (usually IgG or IgA), producing an M- protein spike, and increasing the ESR. The decreased platelet count probably reflects infiltration of the bone marrow by myeloma cells. It is not unusual for patients with malignant myeloma to have recurring bacterial infections, paicularly pneumococcal pneumonia, because the overall production of normal immunoglobulins of all isotypes is decreased. Lytic bone lesions due to infiltration by myeloma cells may lead to pathological fractures. All of the other disorders listed can be associated with an M- protein spike, but this is a nonspecific finding. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is ruled out by the normal white count, since this type of leukemia is generally associated with an absolute lymphocytosis. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (choice B) are generally asymptomatic, although they have a predisposition for subsequently developing myeloma, lymphoma, amyloidosis, or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Plasmacytoma (solitary myeloma) is a rare, isolated plasma cell neoplasm in bone or soft tissues. If the primary cancer is in bone, it is likely to disseminate; extra osseous tumors tend to remain localized. Since this patient had multiple lytic bone lesions, multiple myeloma is the correct diagnosis.

For this reason, most pathologists pay paicular attention to the epithelial lining of the ducts and lobules when evaluating breast biopsy specimens with fibrocystic disease. Fibrocystic breasts without any evidence of epithelial changes do not appear to have any significant increased risk of progression to breast cancer.

Frequently, these epitheloid cells fuse to form giant cells in the periphery or some times in the center of granuloma. Pathogenesis of granuloma Immune granuloma (most common type of granuloma) is a type IV hypersensitivity that involved CD-4 helper T cell. On-exposure to paiculate antigen macrophages process and present this antigen to Helper T cells and also secretes IL-2. T-cells are activated on contact with this antigen and by IL-2. Activated T-cells (helper) produce IFN-y, the major cytokine of granulomatous inflammation. IFN-y has the following effects It is the most impoant activator of macrophages. It induce granuloma formation by conversion of activated macrophages into epitheliod cells and formation of giant cell. Augment the differentiation of T-cells. Finally there is formation of granuloma induced by IFN-y. Remember Foreign body (Nonimmune) granuloma consist almost entirely of epitheloid cells and multinucleated giant cells but no lymphocytes. Granulomas induced by parasites contain a large component of eosinophils. In lymphogranuloma venerum and Cat scratch disease granulomas have a characteristic central neutrophilic abscess surrounded by macrophages and other mononuclear cells.",

Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as liver and pancreas. The total body content of the iron is tightly regulated, as the daily losses are matched by gastrointestinal absorption. In hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of intestinal absorption of dietary iron is lost, leading to net iron accumulation of 0. 5 to 1. 0 gm/year. It may be recalled that the total body iron pool ranges from 2-6 gm in normal adults; about 0. 5 gm is stored in the liver 98% of which are hepatocytes. In hemochromatosis, the iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one-third of which accumulates in the liver. The iron accumulation is lifelong, the rate of net iron accumulation is 0. 5 to 1. 0 gm/year. The disease manifests itself typically after 20 gm of storage iron have accumulated. The disease first manifests itself in the fifth to sixth decades of life. Excessive iron is directly toxic to host tissues The clinical features of hemochromatosis are characterized principally by deposition of excess iron in the following organs in decreasing order of severity.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Platelet thrombus Thrombosis o Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) inside a blood vessel or hea, obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system. Then what is the difference between formation of normal hemostatic plug and thrombosis? o When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses platelet and fibrin to form a blood clot as the first step to prevent blood loss --> hemostasis. o If that mechanism causes too much doting, a thrombus is formed i. e., exaggeration of hemostatic process leads to thrombus formation. o In other terms, hemostasis is a self limited process i. e., there is spontaneous resolution of hemostatic plug with subsequent repair of the injury, while thrombosis is not self limited and the thrombotic clot does not undergo resolution spontaneously rather it causes obstruction to blood flow. o Thrombosis may occur without injury (e. g., in hypercoagulable state), while hemostatic plug is formed only after injury. Pathogenesis of thrombosis o Thrombosis is caused by abnormalities in one or more of the following three (Virchow's triad):? Vascular (endothelial) injury. Abnormal blood flow (stasis or turbulence). Blood hypercoagulability. How do these mechanisms lead to thrombosis? o Endothelial injury with formation of clot has already been explained earlier. o Blood hypercoagulability, as the name suggests, there is increase tendency of clot formation due to alteration in coagulation pathway that predisposes to thrombus. It may occur in many primary (genetic) or secondary (acquired) conditions. o Disturbances in blood flow Stasis Stasis is the major factor in the development of venous thrombus. Turbulence contributes to aerial and cardiac thrombosis. Normal blood flow is laminar such that the platelets flow centrally in the vessel lumen, separated from the endothelium by a slower-moving clear zone of plasma. Stasis and turbulence leads to thrombosis by? Disruption of laminar flow brings platelets into contact with endothelium. Prevent dilution of activated clotting factors by fresh flowing blood. Retard the inflow of clotting factor inhibitors. Turbulence can cause endothelial injury or dysfunction.",

Follicular lymphoma involves the lymph nodes and bone marrow of older people and is characterized by slow, but relentless, growth. Thus, this lymphoma allows a long survival even without any treatment. Indeed, follicular lymphoma is resistant to aggressive therapy because of its low mitotic activity. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a neoplasm of pre-B cells that affects children. Different molecular mechanisms probably account for different cases. Hyperdiploidy, the Philadelphia chromosome, t(12; 21), and t(4; 11) are variably found in patients with ALL. Burkitt lymphoma occurs in different clinical settings, including the African endemic, sporadic non endemic, and AIDS-associated forms. Histologically, all these forms are identical and are derived from neoplastic transformation of B cells expressing surface IgM. Common to all forms are translocations involving the c-myc oncogene (chromosome 8) and Ig loci (chromosome 14). These translocations lead to overexpression of c-myc, which encodes a nuclear transcription protein, resulting in sustained cell replication. The African form is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Multiple myeloma is a neoplasm of terminally differentiated B lymphocytes that secrete large amounts of monoclonal Ig or its fragments (light or heavy chains).

Tunica Intima o The inner most layer (towards lumen) of aery is intima. o It consists of endothelial cells which rest on basment membrane. o There is some subendothelial connective tissue. o Intima is separated from media by internal elastic lamina. Tunica Media o It is mainly contains smooth muscles and laminae of elastic tissue Media is separated from adventitia by external elastic lamina. Tunica Adyentitia o It is the outer most layer. o Contains collegen and elastic fibers. Structure of capillaries o Capillaries are thin walled vessels made up of single layer of endothelial cells with its basement membrane. o Capillaries are of three types? Continous capillaries? o These capillaries has continuous lining of endothelial cells with no fenestration. o Basement membrane is also continuous. Fenesterated capillaries o There are fenestration between the endothelial cells. o Basment membrane is continuous. Sinusoidal capillaries o Both endothelial cells and basement membrane have fenestration. o In resting tissues, most of the capillaries are collapsed and blood flows through the throughfare vessels from the aerioles to the venules. Structure of veins o Structure of vein is smiliar to aery except that? 1. Wall is thinner Three tunicae are less well demarcated. Elastic tissue is scanty and not clearly organized into distinct internal and external elastic lamina. 4. Have valves (except venae cavae and common iliac vein). Note?

Primary ciliary dyskinesia/PCD/immotile ciliary syndrome/ Kaagener Syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder which causes a defect in the action of the cilia lining the respiratory tract (lower and upper, sinuses, Eustachian tube, middle ear) and fallopian tube. PCD is a genetically heterogenous disorder affecting motile cilia. Around 90% of individuals have ultrastructural defects affecting protein(s) in the outer and/or inner dynein arms which give cilia their motility. When accompanied by the combination of situs inversus (reversal of the internal organs), chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis, it is known as Kaagener syndrome. The main consequence of impaired ciliary function is reduced or absent mucus clearance from the lungs, and susceptibility to chronic recurrent respiratory infections, including sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and otitis media. Infeility is common, due to defective ciliary action in the follopian tube in affected females or diminished sperm motility in affected males.",

It may arise de novo (i. e., without preexisting hypertension), or it may appear suddenly in a person who had mild hypertension. Pathogenesis The basis for this turn for the worse in hypertensive subjects is unclear, but the following sequence is suggested: The initial event seems to be some form of vascular damage to the kidneys. This most commonly results from long-standing hypertension, with eventual injury to the arteriolar walls. The result is increased permeability of the small vessels to fibrinogen and other plasma proteins, endothelial injury, and platelet deposition. This leads to the appearance of fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles and small arteries and intravascular thrombosis. Mitogenic factors from platelets (e. g., plateletderived growth factor) and plasma cause intimal hyperplasia of vessels, resulting in the hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis typical of organizing injury of malignant hypertension and of morphologically similar thrombotic microangiopathies (see later) and further narrowing of the lumina.

Infact this feature is used in suspecting the diagnosis of Down's Syndrome prenataly. DOWN'S SYNDROME o Down's syndrome is a condition in which extra genetic material causes delay in the way a child develops, and often leads to mental retardation. o In Down's syndrome the child gets an extra chromosome, he has total of 47 chromosome instead of 46 chromosome. o This extra genetic material causes the physical and cognitive delays associated with Down's syndrome. o There is a well recognised association with advancing maternal age, the risk considerably increases in women > 35 years of age. o Advanced paternal age has very little effect. Clinical features o Most striking feature in the neonate is hypotonia and although the diagnosis is usually evident at this time, it may sometimes be missed if the baby is very premature or his facial features are concealed by ventilatory apparatus. o Other clinical features include:? 1. General:- Mental retardation, sho stature 2. Cranio-facial Brachycephaly, epicanthic fold, protruding tongue, small ears, upward sloping palpebral fissures, strabismus, nystagmus, Brushfied spots in iris. 3.

The rate of sickling is influenced by the intracellular concentration of hemoglobin S and by the presence of other hemoglobins within the cell. In Sickle cell trait the low level of HbS is insufficient to produce sickling unless there is profound hypoxia. Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in which an abnormal hemoglobin leads to chronic hemolytic anemia with numerous clinical consequences. It is caused by a single DNA base change leading to an amino acid substitution of valine for glutamine in the sixth position on the beta-globin chain. In Sickle cell disease patients are homozygous and 80% of their hemoglobin is HbS. Hemoglobin S is unstable and polymerizes in the setting of various stressors, including hypoxemia and acidosis, leading to the formation of sickled red blood cells.

Mechanism of injury o Regardless of the nature of injurious agents, there are a number of common biochemical themes or mechanisms responsible for cell injury:? A. Diminished generation of. ATP o Diminished generation of ATP constitutes the critical mechanism of cellular injury and occurs in both reversible and irreversible phases. o Depletion of ATP to < 5% to 10% of normal levels has widespread effects on many critical cellular system:? Activity of Na+ K+ ATPase is reduced. It is ATP dependent pump that cause effux of Na+ and influx of K+. Decreased activity of this pump leads to intracellular accumulation of sodium. The net gain in solute is accompnied by isoosmotic water gain, causing cell swelling. Normally Na+ inhibits efflux of Ca' and promotes influx of Ca+2. When activity of Na+K+ ATPase is reduced, there is increased intracellular Na+--> T influx and efflux of Ca' --> T intracellular calclium. 3. Decreased ATP synthesis results in an increased rate of anaerobic glycolysis --> T Lactic acid accumulation. 1, pH --> decreased activity of many cellular enzymes and clumping of nuclear chromatin. 4. Depletion of ATP results in structural disruption of protein synthetic apparatus Detachment of ribosomes from rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) reduction in protein synthesis. B. Increased intracellular calcium o Sustained rise in intracellular calcium activates a number of enzymes ATPase fuher ATP depletion Phospholipases Membrane damage Proteases --> Damage to membrane and cystoskeleton proteins. Endonulcease --> Damage to DNA. C. Membrane damage o It occurs due to Mitochondrial dysfunction --> Defective mitochondrias function results in decrease phospholipid synthesis which is an impoant constituent of cell membrane and mitochondrial membrane. Increased intracellular Ca' activates phospholipase --> Damage to cell membrane, mitochondrial membrane and membrane of other organelles. Increase in intracellular Ca' results in activation of proteases --> damage to cystoskeletal filaments that serve as anchors connecting the plasma membrane to the cell interior. Free radicals cause damae to cell membrane. D.

Vegetations occur on structurally abnormal valves. Invasion does not tend to cause perforation or erosion of underlying valve leaflet, but often extend onto the adjacent mural endocardium- In prosthetic valves. Vegetations tend to form on margin of the sewing ring --> ring abscesses.

Primary amyloidosis is one of the more common forms of systemic amyloidosis, and can affect a variety of organs, including the hea, kidney, peripheral nerve, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract. In primary amyloidosis, the amyloid is composed of immunoglobulin light chains, and the disease is now interpreted as a plasma cell disorder closely related to multiple myeloma. This interpretation is clinically significant, as it has led to modern treatments of primary amyloidosis (which formerly had a dismal prognosis) with the chemotherapies designed for multiple myeloma. The treatments are effective only if the disease is recognized and passed to the appropriate specialists as early as possible in the clinical course. Amyloid AA is seen in inflammation-associated amyloidosis and familial Mediterranean fever. Beta-2-microglobulin comprises the amyloid of dialysis-associated amyloidosis.

Grossly -> There stages of the disease can be identified Patch (Ist stage) Plaque (intermediate stage) Nodule (last stage) Histologically - The changes are nonspecific in the early patch stage and more characteristic in the nodular stage which show. Sheets of plump proliferating spindle cells and endothelial in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue More on Kaposi Sarcoma C/f of Kaposi Sarcoma. Kaposi sarcoma lesions most commonly appear as raised macules, however, they can also be papular or nodular. Lesions often appear in the sun-exposed areas, particularly the tip of the nose. Confident lesions may give rise to surrounding lymphedema and may be disfiguring when they involve the face and disabling when they involve the lower extremities. Apart from skin, Kaposi sarcoma can involve almost any other organ such as lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract and lung. In contrast to most malignancies in which lymph node involvement implies metastatic spread and a poor prognosis, lymph node involvement is seen very early in Kaposi sarcoma and is of no special clinical significance. Management of Kaposi Sarcoma. Definitive treatment guidelines do not exist for the management of Kaposi sarcoma. In the majority of cases, effective antiretroviral therapy achieves control. Spontaneous regression has been noted in several cases. Fewer than 10% of AIDS patient with KS die as a consequence of their malignancy. Thus whenever possible one should avoid t/t. Treatment is indicated under two main circumstances I. Single lesion or a limited number of lesions are causing significant discomfort or cosmetic problems e. g. prominent facial lesions, lesions overlying joint or lesions in the oropharynx that cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing, t/t in these cases are Localized radiation Intralesional vinblastine Cryotherapy II. Patients with large no lesions or in patients with visceral involvement - t/t in these cases Interferon S is the first choice for single agent systemic therapy for early patients with disseminated disease other drugs which can be used in these cases are Liposomal daunorubicin Liposomal doxorubicin Paclitaxel Liposomal daunorubicin has been approved as first-line therapy for a patient with advanced KS. Various forms of Kaposi Sarcoma. There are at least four distinct epidemiological forms of Kaposi sarcoma. I. Classic form is seen in older men of Mediterranean or Eastern European origin.

When red blood cells with hemogblobin S are exposed to this low oxygen tension they tend to aggregate and polymerize. Sickled cells also express more adhesion molecules and appear more sticky. The sickle cells arrest in the hypoxic vascular bed in the spleen, resulting in a vicious cycle: decrease in 02, sickling and vascular obstruction from thrombus formation. Initially the spleen is enlarged, then progressively becomes smaller. The stasis of flow in the spleen causes hypoxic damage, thrombosis, infarction and fibrosis.

With only one gene, the synthesis of a-chain is markedly reduced and tetramers of excess b-globin, called HbH, form. HbH has extremely high affinity for oxygen and therefore is not useful for oxygen exchange, leading to tissue hypoxia dispropoionate to the level of hemoglobin. Patients have moderate to severe anemia that may require occasional blood transfusion. iv) Hydrops fetalis There is deletion of all four a-globin genes. In the fetus, excess y-globin chains form tetramers, known as hemoglobin has. Hemolgobin ba has such a high affinity for oxygen that it delivers almost no oxygen to tissues.

C125) that was generated by immunizing laboratory mice with a cell line established from human ovarian carcinoma. It circulates in the serum of patients with ovarian carcinoma and was therefore investigated for possible use as a marker. CAl25 is often elevated in patients with ovarian cancer, its level following the patient's clinical course. With surgical resection or chemotherapy, the level correlates with patient response. Thus, it is superior to other markers such as CEA. Because of the low prevalence of ovarian cancer, the test is not itself useful in screening.",

Low back pain and a stretching or pulling sensation are characteristic of ascites in some patients (ascites can also be asymptomatic). The etiology of the fluid accumulation in Meigs syndrome remains a mystery. Ectopic pregnancy would not be associated with hydrothorax. If an ectopic pregnancy ruptured, blood could accumulate in the abdominal cavity, but the patient would likely be hypotensive or dead. An endometrial implant could cause pain, or impair feility, but would not be expected to produce the combination of ascites and isolated right-sided hydrothorax.

Because in heart failure, there is an almost always excessive increase in both the right and left atrial pressures that stretch the atrial walls the circulating levels of ANP in the blood increase fivefold to tenfold in severe heart failure. The ANF, in turn, has a direct effect on the kidneys to increase greatly their excretion of salt and water.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., In Brutons agammaglobulinemia opsonisation is not affected o During phagocytosis there is rapid respiratory burst which is brought about by rapid burst in the activity of NADPH oxidase. o Increased NADPH oxidase activity leads to increased oxidative proesses and there by increased production of superoxide anion (0, -) Superoxide is then conveed to hydrogen peroxide (H202) free radical. o The H202 generated by NADPH oxidase system is not able to kill the bacteria itself. However, the azurophilic granules of the neutrophils contain the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) which in presence of halide such as CI-conves H20, to hypochlorite (HOCI). o Hypochlorite (HOCI) is a potent antimicrobicidal agent that destroys microbes by halogenation. o The H202 - MPO - halide system is the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils. Chediak higashi syndrome o It is an autosomal recessive disorder. o Chediak higashi syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene. o This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transpo of materials into lysosomes. o Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins. o During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias. o Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phatosome to form nhaeolysosome. Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation. o As a result, most people with chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, staing in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening. o Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected. o The other cells involved are - Melanosomes of melanocytes Dense bodies of platelets Granules of schwann cells o There are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells. o In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism i. e the colour ofskin, hair and eye is reduced. o Abnormality in platelets produce bleeding disorders. o Defective granules in schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e. g. peripheral neuropathy. o Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase (lymphoma like stage). o This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E. B. virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. o The accelarated phase is associated with lever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life threatening and lead to death. About option 'c' o Antibodies help in opsonization of encapsulated bacterias such as staphylococcus aureus, H influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae. o The polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the encapsulated bacteria is a potent virulent agent. It protects the bacteria from phagocytosis. o These bacterias can only be phagocytosed when they are opsonised (coated) with specific proteins (opsonins). Opsonized (coated) bacterias become attractive targets for phagocytes because phagocytes express high affinity receptors for opsonins. o The major opsonins present in the body are IgG antibody and C3b complement. o In Bruton's agammaglobulinemia antibodies are absent therefore opsonisation is defective.",

Negri bodies are discrete, intracytoplasmic, deeply eosinophilic inclusions that measure several microns in diameter. In about 75% of cases of rabies these can be seen on hematoxylin and eosin stained sections. They occur in neurons of the brain stem, paicularly those in the hippocampus, and in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Ultrastructural studies have shown that Negri body consists of a mass of nucleocapsids surrounded by viral paicles budding from intracytoplasmic membranes. Those bodies can be seen in axons, and it is in this way that virus spreads from the central nervous system to many organs of the body. Because Negri bodies are usually seen in intact neurons, they are found away from the inflammatory, nonspecific lesions. Rabies viral antigens can be demonstrated in infected cells by means of fluorescent antibody technique. Antigens can be shown to be present in cells in the absence of Negri bodies, and hence this technique is much more sensitive than the search of sections of brain for the pathognomonic cytoplasmic inclusions.",

Chylomicrons transpo the dietry lipid from intestine to liver. o In Diet the major lipids are triglyceride and Aolesterol. o Cholesterol is absorbed as such in proximal small intestine and is esterified to cholesteryl ester (ChE). o Triglycerides are hydrolysed by lipases to glycerol and fatty acids which are absorbed in intestine. o Inside intestinal cells triglyceride is synthesized by fatty acids. Chylomicrons are synthesized in the small intestine that contain triglyceride, cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, phospholipids and apoprotein B-48 (apo B-48). o These chylomicrons are secreted in the intestinal lymph and reach the systemic circulation thoracic duct. In the circulation Apo E and Apo C are transfered to chylomicrones by HDL, so now chylomicrons contain Apo B-48, Apo E, & Apo C. o In the circulation, Triglycerides of chylomicrones are hydrolysed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) present on endothelial cells of vessels of skeletal muscles, adipose tissue and hea. o The released fatty acids are utilized locally by these tissues. o The chilomicron paicle progressively shrinks in size by action of LPL and, cholesterol, phospholipids and apo C are transferred to HDL, creating chylomicron remnants that contains more cholesterol, less triglycerides, apo E & apo B-48. o Chylomicron remnants are removed by liver by the LDL receptors that require apo E as ligand. Note - Apo C-II, that is transfered from HDL to chylomicrons act as a cofactor for lipoprotein lipase. Apo A-V promotes LPL mediated triglyceride lipolysis in VLDL and chilomicrons. 2. Transpo of Hepatic lipids (Endogenous pathway)o VLDL is synthesized in liver that contains high triglyceride, ChE, cholesterol, phospholipid and Apo B-100. (VLDL paicles resembel chylomicrones in composition except that VLDL contains Apo B-100 instead of ApoB-48). o VLDL paicles are secreted in the plasma and as with chylomicron, Apo E and Apo C are transferred from HDLto VLDL. Now VLDL contains Apo B-100, Apo E and Apo C. o In plasma, triglycerides of VLDL are hydrolysed by same lipoprotein lipase (see above) and apo C is transferredto HDL and the remmants are called IDL. o 40-60% of IDL is removed by liver LDL receptor mediated endocytosis, this process require Apo E whichacts as ligand for LDL receptors. o Remaining 1 DL is remodeled by hepatic lipase to form LDL that contains maximum cholesterol. o 70% of LDL is removed by liver LDL receptor and 30% is utilized by peripheral tissues as a source ofcholesterol.",

Free radicals o Free radicals are chemical species that have a single unpaired electron in the outer orbit. o Most of these are paially reduced reactive oxygen forms that are produced as an unavoidable byproduct of mitochondrial respiration --> also known as reactive oxygen species. o The most impoant are hydrogen peroxide (11202), Superoxide anion (02) and hydroxyl radical (OH). o Free radicals are highly reactive species and toxic --> they can damage the cell membrane and nucleic acids. o Free radicals initiate autocatalytic reactions, whereby molecules with which they react are themselves conveed into free radicals to propagate the chain of damage. o Free radicals are produced in several ways:? I. Ionizing radiations (UV rays, X-rays) can hydrolyze water into hydroxyl (OH) and hydrogen (H) free radicals. Enzymatic metabolism of exogenous chemicals, e. g., CC14 can generate CC13. The reduction - oxidation reaction during normal metabolic process. During normal respiration, molecular oxygen is sequentially reduced by addition of electron to generate water. In this process small amount of H202, 02- and OH- are produced. o H202 generated, can interact with 02 to generate OH through the Haber-weiss reaction. H202+ 02 --> OH- + OH + 02 Rapid burst of superoxide (02) occur in activated neutrophils during inflammation with the help of. NADPH oxidase. Some intracellular oxidases, e. g., xanthine oxidase generate superoxide radicals.

Resorption atelectasis is caused principally by obstruction due to excessive secretions (mucus plug) or exudates within small bronchioles as seen in Bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis, Bronchiectasis and foreign body aspiration. 2. Compression atelectasis The collapse of lung occurs due to external pressure on the lung. It is seen most commonly in patients with cardiac failure who develop pleural effusion and in patients with neoplastic pleural effusion. 3.

An area of attachment to the underlying vessel or heart wall, frequently firmest at the point of origin, is characteristic of all thromboses. Arterial thrombi tend to grow in a retrograde direction from the point of attachment, whereas venous thrombi extend in the direction of blood flow (i. e., toward the heart). The propagating tail may not be well attached and, particularly in veins, is prone to fragmentation, creating an embolus. When formed in the heart or aorta, thrombi may have grossly (and microscopically) apparent laminations, called lines of Zahn; these are produced by alternating pale layers of platelets admixed with some fibrin and darker layers containing more red cells. Lines of Zahn are significant only in that they imply thrombosis at a site of blood flow; in veins or in smaller arteries, the laminations are typically not as apparent When arterial thrombi arise in heart chambers or in the aortic lumen, they usually adhere to the wall of the underlying structure and are termed mural thrombi. Arterial thrombi are usually occlusive; the most common sites, in descending order, are coronary, cerebral, and femoral arteries. Venous thrombosis, or phlebothrombosis, is almost invariably occlusive; the thrombus often creates a long cast of the vein lumen. Because these thrombi form in a relatively static environment, they tend to contain more enmeshed erythrocytes and are therefore known as red, or stasis, thrombi",

Antihypeensive therapy in acute aoic dissection aims specifically to lessen pulsatile load or aoic stress, in order to retard the propagation of the dissection and prevent aoic rupture. The goals of treatment are to prevent myocardial ischemia, decrease left ventricular afterload, decrease myocardial oxygen consumption, and prevent rupture and bleeding from suture lines. Nitroprusside is a potent direct aerial and venous dilator, acting through release of nitric oxide. It has a rapid onset of action, and a shoer half-life and thus is given in the form of continuous infusion. The hypotensive effects of nitroprusside can be unpredictable because it simultaneously causes potent venodilatation and peripheral aerial vasodilatation. This is especially the case for patients with severe left ventricular hyperophy and preload-dependent diastolic dysfunction. It has been shown to cause coronary steal; it can cause a significant reflex tachycardia, and it can decrease oxygen circulation. It is photosensitive, so it requires special handling. Its most serious adverse effect is in the form of cyanide toxicity, which occurs due to accumulation of its metabolites thiocyanate/ cyanide and its clinical presentation may vary leading to difficulty in diagnosis. Thus, it is recommended that this drug be used only when other intravenous antihypeensive agents are not available",

The sickle cells arrest in the hypoxic vascular bed in the spleen, resulting in a vicious cycle: decrease in 02, sickling and vascular obstruction from thrombus formation. Initially the spleen is enlarged, then progressively becomes smaller. The stasis of flow in the spleen causes hypoxic damage, thrombosis, infarction and fibrosis.

This type of necrosis is most frequently caused by sudden cessation of blood flow (ischemia) in organs such as hea (MI), Kidney (ATN), adrenal gland, and spleen. Note: Brain is the only exception, i. e.,. It is the only solid organ in which ischemia leads to liquifactive necrosis not coagulative necrosis. It is also seen with other types of injury e. g., liver necrosis in viral hepatitis, Coagulative necrosis of skin after burns (Thermal injury). Why there is predominant protein denaturation and no enzymatic digestion? Hypoxia causes intracellular acidosis (has been explained earlier). 1, pH results in denaturation of proteins which includes not only structural proteins but also enzymes --) So, there is no enzymatic digestion. The necrotic cells retain their cellular outline for several days. Liquefactive necrosis It is the necrotic degradation of tissue that rapidly undergo softening and liquefaction because of the action of hydrolytic enzymes. It occurs after Infection i. e., suppurative inflammation (most common). Ischemic necrosis in brain. Note: Brain lacks any substantial suppoive stroma, so ischemic necrosis in brain is liquifactive unlike other organs where it is coagulative. Mechanism of liquefactive necrosis --> Microbes stimulates accumulation of inflammatory cells and these cells release lysosomal enzymes. Caseous necrosis It is a variant of coagulative necrosis. It is most commonly encountered when cell death is attributable to ceain organisms e. g., mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and fungi (Histoplasma, Coccidioidomycosis). Why is it called caseous necrosis, not coagulative necrosis? In contrast to coagulative necrosis where tissue architecture is maintained, in caseous necrosis, the tissue architecture is completely obliterated. So, it has been called caseous because of its cheesy white appearance of the area of necrosis.",

HbS is formed by replacement of Glutamine by Valine at position 6 This substitution replaces the polar Glutamine residue with a nonpolar Valine. The replacement of Glutamine by Valine generates a sticky patch on the surface of HBS. The sticky patch is present on both oxygenated and deoxygenated HbS The deoxygenated HbS also contains a complementary site for the sticky patch. In oxygenated hemoglobin this complementary site is masked. When HbS is deoxygenated the sticky patch present on its surface binds to the complementary patch on another deoxygenated HbS molecules. This binding leads to polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin S forming long fibrous precipitates. These extend throughout the erythrocyte and mechanically distort it, causing lysis and multiple secondary clinical effect. So, if HbS can be maintained in an oxygenated state or if the concentration of deoxygenated HbS can be minimized, formation of these polymers will not occur and sickling can be prevented (Remember the complementary site for the sticky patch remains masked in case of Oxygenated HbS). Role of HbA in polymerization - Unlike HbS, A does not contain any sticky patch, but it does have a binding site for the sticky patch of 1,, S. Thus it can bind to HbS through its receptor site but this binding cannot extend the polymer because HbA does not contain any sticky patch to promote binding to still another hemoglobin molecule. So HbA interferes with the polymerization and aggregation of HbS and reduces the intensity of sickle cell anemia.",

Wide variations in the clinical expression of this syndrome are recognized, ranging from a complete, typical form manifesting all abnormalities listed below through incomplete, abortive, and atypical forms. The important clinical manifestations of the disease are: Antimongoloid palpebral fissures with a coloboma of the outer portion of the lower lids, and deficiency of the eye-lashes (and sometimes the upper lids). Hypoplasia of the facial bones, especially of the malar bones and mandible. Malformation of the external ear, and occasionally of the middle and internal ears. Macrostomia, high palate (sometimes cleft) and abnormal position and malocclusion of the teeth. Blind fistulas between the angles of the ears and the angles of the mouth. Atypical hair growth in the form of a tongue-shaped process of the hairline extending towards the cheeks. Other anomalies such as facial clefts and skeletal deformities. The characteristic faces of the patients have often been described as being bird like or fish like in nature. The syndrome is thought to result from a retardation or failure of differentiation of maxillary mesoderm at and after the 50 mm stage of the embryo. The fact that the teeth of the upper jaw are usually unaffected, and ordinarily are present by the sixth week, is further evidence of retardation or arrest of differentiation at or after the second month of fetal life. The first visceral arch of the visceral mesoderm also advances secondarily to form the mandible, and again retardation occurs on the same basis. A disease that has sometimes been confused with mandibulofacial dysostosis, because of certain clinical features in common is hemifacial microsomia (also known as oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia or Goldenhar syndrome). However, hemifacial microsomia is sporadic in the vast majority of cases, although familial cases have been reported. In addition as the name implies, this disease is unilateral and has been suggested to be related to an abnormality in the vascular supply of the head.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Retinoblastoma Retinoblastoma is a prime example of a tumour which is associated with loss of heterozygosity. This term is mostly used in the context of oncogenesis. o The mutations required to produce retinoblastomes involves the RB gene located on chromosome 13 q14. o RB gene is a tumour suppressor gene. RB gene is active in hypophosphorylated state and phosphorylation causes inactivation of RB, i. e. phosphorylated RB is inactive. o Retinoblastoma develops when both the normal alleles of the RB gene are inactivated or altered. o In familial case of retinoblastoma, children are born with one normal and one defective copy of the RB gene. Such a child is said to be heterozygous at the RB locus (one allele of the gene is normal while the other one is a mutant). This implies that heterozygosity for the RB gene does not affect cell behaviour i. e., (cancer does not develop as long as one gene is normal) o Cancer develops when both the alleles are mutant i. e., when the cell becomes homozygous for the mutant allele or you can put it in another way, when the cell loses heterozygosity for the normal RB gene (a condition known as loss of heterozygosity). o Make it clear that in oncology, loss of heterozygosity occurs when the remaining functional allete in a somatic cell of the off spring becomes inactivated by mutation. This results in no normal tumour suppressor gene being produced and almost ceainly results in tumourogenesis. o It is a common occurrence in cancer, where it indicates the absence of a functional tumour suppressor gene in the lost region. o Loss of heterozygosity is the basis of two hit hypothesis of cancers (Knudson's hypothesis) o In hereditary cases of Retinoblastoma one genetic change (first hit) is inherited from the affected parent therefore it is present in all the somatic cells of the body. But one genetic change is not sufficient to produce cancer. o The second mutation (second hit) is required to produce cancer. It occurs in the retinal cells (which are carrying the first mutation). The mutation occuring in Retinal cells is acquired. In sporadic cases both mutations (hits) occur somatically within a single retinal cell whose progeny then form the tumour.",

        "question": "A 22-year-old woman presents with painless cervical lymphadenopathy, night sweats, and generalized pruritus. An enlarged cervical lymph node is removed for diagnosis. On cut surface, it shows broads bands of fibrosis. Histologically, the affected lymph node contains a mixture of cells, including lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophils, plasma cells, and scattered large cells with prominent nucleoli. Which of the following is the most likely condition?",
        "exp": "The history is consistent with Hodgkin disease (HD). Impoant clinical clues include painless lymphadenopathy, night sweats, and generalized pruritus. All forms of lymphoma lead to effacement of the nodal architecture on cut surfaces. In this case, fibrotic bands appear to divide the node into multiple nodules. This finding is suggestive of the nodular sclerosis subtype of HD, which usually affects children and young adults. Fuhermore, the histologic finding of large cells with prominent nucleoli (Reed-Sternberg cells) within a polymorphic cellular background is consistent with HD. Remember that the nodular sclerosis type of HD is characterized by a subtype of Reed-Sternberg cells called lacunar cells. These are similar to classic Reed-Sternberg cells in their large, inclusion-like nucleoli, but appear surrounded by a clear halo (hence the attribute \"lacunar\"). Cat-scratch disease is due to a small gram-negative bacillus (Baonella henselae), which is transmitted to humans by a scratch or a bite by a cat. Swelling of lymph nodes develops days after the skin lesion. The history is generally sufficient for diagnosis, but occasionally a lymph node biopsy is performed for confirmation. This reveals characteristic stellate abscesses, which are also seen with tularemia and lymphogranuloma venereum. Reactive non-specific lymphadenitis results in hyperplasia of germinal centers of lymphoid follicles, where maturation of B-cells takes place--follicular hyperplasia. This is probably the most common form of lymphadenopathy in otherwise healthy individuals. However, a careful search of the inciting conditions (dental abscess, skin infection, etc.) must be undeaken before reaching a conclusion of reactive lymphadenitis without histologic analysis. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is associated with effacement of lymph node architecture, and replacement by a population of atypical or frankly anaplastic lymphocytes. The presence of a polymorphic cellular background, and especially the finding of Reed-Sternberg cells, excludes non-Hodgkin lymphomas.",

        "question": "All the following polyps are premalignant except: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Hyperplastic polyps It is now appreciated that hyperplastic polyps are without malignant potential Juvenile polyps that are single and have been completely excised carry no significant increased risk of malignancy. Multiple juvenile polyps can be a sign of the familial juvenile polyposis syndrome. This has a significant risk (approximately 10 per cent) of subsequent colon cancer and also a possible increased risk of cancers of the stomach and duodenum (first pa of the small intestine). Juvenile polyposis (JP) Autosomal dominant. Multiple hamaomatous polyps of the colorectum (98%), stomach (13%), small bowel (6%) Juvenile polyps are usually pedunculated, smooth, lobulated with a vulnerable surface. Diagnostic criteria: - 5 or more juvenile polyps in the colon or rectum; OR - One juvenile polyp and positive family history of JP; OR - Juvenile polyps outside the colon or rectum, i. e. stomach/small bowel. Family history positive in 20-50%, suggesting high incidence of spontaneous mutations or low penetrance. Children/ adolescents often presents with iron deficiency anemia, hypoproteinemia and retarded growth. Also rectal prolapse or other congenital abnormalities (15%) in CVS, Urogenital tract and CNS. Cancer risk: - Increased risk, lifetime risk of 20-60% for colorectal cancer. - Median age at diagnosis is 35-40 years. - Increased risk for gastric and duodenal cancers Genetic testing - Germline mutations of the SMAD4 and BMPR1A are detected in 11-25% and 18-30% of patients of JPC. - Gastric polyposis seems to be more frequent and severe in patients with SMAD4 mutations. Treatment - Colectomy and gastric surgery in severe polyposis. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) Autosomal dominant inherited disease, > 100 colorectal adenomas, caused by germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene APC (detectable in 80-90% of patients with typical FAP) Prevalence 1: 10000 with penetrance close to 100%. 25% of patients with FAP do not have positive family history. These are de novo germline mutations. Polyp development stas in distal colorectum at an average age of 15 Majority of patients become symptomatic with bloody diarrhea by the age of 25 Extracolonic manifestation: - Up to 90% of patients with FAP develop polyps in upper GIT - 30-40% gastric fundic gland polyposis and 5-10% gastric adenomas - Risk for gastric cancer not increased. Major causes of death in colectomized FAP patients are duodenal and ampullary cancer. Spigelman classification for polyposis in upper GIT to allow adequate follow up. Extra-intestinal manifestation of FAP include: - Desmoid tumours (10-20%) - Epidermoid cysts (30-50%) - Fibromas - Osteomas (often in the mandibula) Congenital hyperophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (70%) - Dental abnormalities. Gardner's syndrome: - Polyposis, epidermoid cysts, osteoma Turcot's syndrome in FAP - Polyposis, CNS tumours (medulloblastoma) Increased risk observed for: - Hepatoblastoma, follicular thyroid cancer, brain tumours (usually medulloblastoma). Treatment: - Procedure: Proctocolectomy with ileal-pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA): Gold standard. Peutz Jeghers syndrome (PJS) Autosomal dominant. Special type of hamaomatous GI polyp (PJ polyp) and mucocutaneous melanin pigmentations. PJ polyps occur throughout alimentary tract with predilection for the small bowel. Mostly jejunal. Esophagus is spared. Rarely nose, gallbladder and ureter. Polyps characterized by extensive smooth muscle aborization throughout polyp. Pigment lesions in 95% of patients but may disappear with age. Mostly lips, peri-oral and intra-oral mucosa. Diagnostic criteria: 2 or more PJ polyps - One PJ polyp and mucocutaneous pigment lesion - One PJ polyp and positive family history of PJS. Endoscopic or surgical excision of large or symptomatic polyps is recommended. Family history is negative in up to 45% of index cases indicating de novo germline mutations. Recurrent colicky abdominal pain due to intussusception in adolescence or young adulthood. Also occult bleeding with iron-deficiency anemia. Pigmentation not always present in childhood and may fade later in life. Intra-epithelial neoplasia predisposes to cancer - hamaoma-adenoma-carcinoma sequence Cancer risk: - 85% by age 70 years - 57% GI cancer. - Colorectal cancer most common with lifetime risk of 39%. Lifetime pancreatic cancer risk is 11%. Extraintestinal cancers include breast risk (31-50%), endometrium and ovary. Cancer uncommon before age 30 years. Almost all female patients with PJS develop potentially malignant ovarian tumour, the sex cord tumour with annular tubules (SCTAT). Malignant transformation in 20% of all cases. Seoli cell tumours considered as male equivalent of SCTAT with gynaecomastia. Genetic testing - PJS is caused by germline mutation of the STKII tumour suppressor gene.",

There are two types of adult stem cells A) Bone marrow stem cells These are hematopoietic stem cells which reside in bone marrow and differentiate into various blood cells. Although residing mainly in the marrow, a subset circulates normally in the peripheral blood. From 3 weeks to 3 months of intraembryonic life, hematopoietic stem cells in the yolk sac are the primary source of blood cells. From 3 months to just before birth stem cells, migrate to the liver, which is the major organ for hematopoiesis during that period. After birth bone marrow becomes the major source. A remarkable observation about hematopoietic stem cells is that they may capable of giving rise to neurons, hepatocytes, myocardium, bile duct cells, endothelial cells and skeletal muscle. This change in stem cell differentiation from one cell type to another is called transdifferentiation. Other types of bone marrow stem cells are bone marrow stromal cells which can differentiate, depending on the tissue environment, into chondrocytes, osteoblasts, adipocytes, myoblasts, endothelial cell precursors.

        "exp": "\"The most definitive investigation for Amyloidosis is biopsy\". For many years rectal biopsy was the first procedure of choice. An important clinical advance was the recognition that the capillaries in the subcutaneous fat are often involved in patients with systemic amyloidosis and can often provide sufficient tissues for the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Thus, a biopsy of the organ with the most severe clinical involvement is often unnecessary. For example in cardiac amyloidosis, the definitive diagnosis of the type of amyloid can be made using an endomyocardial biopsy specimen with Congo red and immunologic staining of the tissue sample. Alternatively, when a noninvasive testing suggests cardiac amyloidosis - A specific diagnosis is often made by studying a subcutaneous fat aspiration instead of endomyocardial biopsy thereby avoiding an invasive procedure. When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a firm diagnosis, biopsy samples can be collected from other organs. In addition, an advantage to performing a biopsy of an involved organ (e. g., kidney heart) is that it definitively establishes a cause and effect relationship between the organ dysfunction and amyloid. It is important to realize that not all biopsy sites offer the same sensitivity. The best sites of biopsy are: - Abdominal fat pad and (90% sensitivity) Rectal mucosa (73% - 84% sensitivity) Other sites that are often sampled but have poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of amyloid include: - Salivary glands Skin Tongue Gingiva Stomach Bone marrow",

Both HSV-1 (which produces most cold sores) and HSV-2 (which produces most genital herpes) are ubiquitous and contagious. They can be spread when an infected person is producing and shedding the virus. Symptoms of herpes simplex virus infection include watery blisters in the skin or mucous membranes of the mouth, lips or genitals. Lesions heal with a scab characteristic of herpetic disease. However, as neurotropic and neuroinvasive viruses, HSV-1 and -2 persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system in the cell bodies of neurons. After the initial or primary infection, some infected people experience sporadic episodes of viral reactivation or outbreaks. In an outbreak, the virus in a nerve cell becomes active and is transpoed the neuron's axon to the skin, where virus replication and shedding occur and cause new sores.

Factors that interfere with healing may be extrinsic (e. g., infection) or intrinsic to the injured tissue, and systemic or local: Infection is one of the most important causes of delayed healing; it prolongs inflammation and potentially increases the local tissue injury. Diabetes is a metabolic disease that compromises tissue repair for many reasons, and is an important systemic cause of abnormal wound healing. Nutritional status has profound effects on repair; protein malnutrition and vitamin C deficiency, for example, inhibit collagen synthesis and retard healing. Glucocorticoids (steroids) have well-documented anti-inflammatory effects, and their administration may result in weak scars because they inhibit TGF-\u03b2 production and diminish fibrosis. In some instances, however, the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are desirable. For example, in corneal infections, glucocorticoids may be prescribed (along with antibiotics) to reduce the likelihood of opacity due to collagen deposition. Mechanical factors such as increased local pressure or torsion may cause wounds to pull apart (dehisce). Poor perfusion, resulting either from arteriosclerosis and diabetes or from obstructed venous drainage (e. g., in varicose veins), also impairs healing. Foreign bodies such as fragments of steel, glass, or even bone impede healing. The type and extent of tissue injury affects subsequent repair. Complete restoration can occur only in tissues composed of cells capable of proliferating: even then, an extensive injury will probably result in incomplete tissue regeneration and at least partial loss of function. Injury to tissues composed of non-dividing cells must inevitably result in scarring; such is the case with healing of a myocardial infarct. The location of the injury and the character of the tissue in which the injury occurs also are important. Robins 10 th ed page no 93",

Kidney-Histologically, the mesangium and capillary basement membrane of glomeruli are the most frequent renal sites of amyloid deposition, followed by involvement of aeriolar and aerial walls and peritubular interstitial tissues. As the extent of the amyloid deposition increases, the glomerular capillary tufts become obliterated and replaced by functionless spherical masses of amyloid material. Liver- Microscopically, amyloid is initially deposited in the spaces (of Disse) between the hepatocytes and vascular sinusoids. As more amyloid accumulates, it compresses the hepatic cords and sinusoids. The hepatic cords undergo nutritional and pressure atrophy and become displaced or replaced by bands and nodules of amyloid. Spleen-Amyloidosis of the spleen has two different anatomical patterns. Most commonly, the amyloid deposition is limited to the splenic follicles, resulting in the gross appearance of a moderately enlarged spleen dotted with gray nodules (so called \"sago\" spleen). Alternatively, the amyloid deposits may spare the follicles and mainly infiltrate the red pulp sinuses, producing a large, firm spleen mottled with waxy discolorations (\"lardaceous\" spleen).",

This distinction requires extensive histologic sampling of the tumor-capsule-thyroid interface, to exclude capsular and/or vascular invasion. Extensive invasion of adjacent thyroid parenchyma makes the diagnosis of carcinoma obvious in some cases'. Ideal answer for a question for diagnosis of follicular cancer is capsular invasion (better than even vascular invasion) but in the given options, vascular invasion is the answer of choice. Follicular Carcinoma: brushing up key points It is the 2nd most common form of thyroid cancer Seen in women of older age (40-50 yrs.)

Major histocompatibility antigens are major antigens responsible for tissue recognition, and stimulate the acute, rapid type of graft rejection. Each person has unique HLA antigens. The presence of some HLA antigens have been correlated with the ceain autoimmune diseases. Susceptibility to MS is linked to the HLA-DR2 haplotype. The severity of iron overload in hemochromatosis is determined predominantly by genetic factors, namely the expression of HLA-A3 region of the major histocompatibility complex. 85% of patients with Reiter's syndrome will have HLA-B27 antigen present on leukocytes. There is a strong association between type 1 diabetes mellitus and specific HLA-D phenotypes, paicularly HLA-DR3. Also Know: The onset of multiple sclerosis is usually in the years from 20 to 40. Sixty percent of patients are female. There is an increased familial incidence, a 25% concordance in identical twins compared with 2-3% in fraternal twins, and an association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B7 and -DR2.
