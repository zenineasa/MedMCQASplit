Antihypeensive therapy in acute aoic dissection aims specifically to lessen pulsatile load or aoic stress, in order to retard the propagation of the dissection and prevent aoic rupture. The goals of treatment are to prevent myocardial ischemia, decrease left ventricular afterload, decrease myocardial oxygen consumption, and prevent rupture and bleeding from suture lines. Nitroprusside is a potent direct aerial and venous dilator, acting through release of nitric oxide. It has a rapid onset of action, and a shoer half-life and thus is given in the form of continuous infusion. The hypotensive effects of nitroprusside can be unpredictable because it simultaneously causes potent venodilatation and peripheral aerial vasodilatation. This is especially the case for patients with severe left ventricular hyperophy and preload-dependent diastolic dysfunction. It has been shown to cause coronary steal; it can cause a significant reflex tachycardia, and it can decrease oxygen circulation. It is photosensitive, so it requires special handling. Its most serious adverse effect is in the form of cyanide toxicity, which occurs due to accumulation of its metabolites thiocyanate/ cyanide and its clinical presentation may vary leading to difficulty in diagnosis. Thus, it is recommended that this drug be used only when other intravenous antihypeensive agents are not available",

Although nodular glomerulosclerosis is classically described in association with diabetes (the so-called \"Kimmelstiel. Wilson lesion\"), the lesion is not pathognomonic for diabetic nephropathy. In fact, a number of renal conditions have been seen in association with this distinctive, histologic pattern.

Fibronectin glomerulosnephritis. Cryoglobulinemic glomerulosnephritis. Amyloidosis. Light Chain Deposition Disease (LCDD). Heavy Chain Deposition Disease (HCDD). Idiopathic Nodular Glomerulosclerosis. In order to determine the specific disease responsible for nodular glomerulosclerosis, a deliberate inspection of the renal biopsy (paicularly, Congo red staining) is required.

When red blood cells with hemogblobin S are exposed to this low oxygen tension they tend to aggregate and polymerize. Sickled cells also express more adhesion molecules and appear more sticky. The sickle cells arrest in the hypoxic vascular bed in the spleen, resulting in a vicious cycle: decrease in 02, sickling and vascular obstruction from thrombus formation. Initially the spleen is enlarged, then progressively becomes smaller. The stasis of flow in the spleen causes hypoxic damage, thrombosis, infarction and fibrosis. In the end the spleen \"disappears\" completely (termed 'autosplenectomy').",

This type of necrosis is most frequently caused by sudden cessation of blood flow (ischemia) in organs such as heart (MI), Kidney (ATN), adrenal gland, and spleen. Note: Brain is the only exception, i. e.,. It is the only solid organ in which ischemia leads to liquifactive necrosis not coagulative necrosis. It is also seen with other types of injury e. g., liver necrosis in viral hepatitis, Coagulative necrosis of skin after burns (Thermal injury). Why there is predominant protein denaturation and no enzymatic digestion? Hypoxia causes intracellular acidosis (has been explained earlier). 1, pH results in denaturation of proteins which includes not only structural proteins but also enzymes --) So, there is no enzymatic digestion. The necrotic cells retain their cellular outline for several days. Liquefactive necrosis It is the necrotic degradation of tissue that rapidly undergo softening and liquefaction because of the action of hydrolytic enzymes. It occurs after Infection i. e., suppurative inflammation (most common). Ischemic necrosis in brain. Note: Brain lacks any substantial suppoive stroma, so ischemic necrosis in brain is liquifactive unlike other organs where it is coagulative. Mechanism of liquefactive necrosis --> Microbes stimulates accumulation of inflammatory cells and these cells release lysosomal enzymes. Caseous necrosis It is a variant of coagulative necrosis. It is most commonly encountered when cell death is attributable to ceain organisms e. g., mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and fungi (Histoplasma, Coccidioidomycosis). Why is it called caseous necrosis, not coagulative necrosis? In contrast to coagulative necrosis where tissue architecture is maintained, in caseous necrosis, the tissue architecture is completely obliterated. So, it has been called caseous because of its cheesy white appearance of the area of necrosis.",

Wide variations in the clinical expression of this syndrome are recognized, ranging from a complete, typical form manifesting all abnormalities listed below through incomplete, abortive, and atypical forms. The important clinical manifestations of the disease are: Antimongoloid palpebral fissures with a coloboma of the outer portion of the lower lids, and deficiency of the eye-lashes (and sometimes the upper lids). Hypoplasia of the facial bones, especially of the malar bones and mandible. Malformation of the external ear, and occasionally of the middle and internal ears. Macrostomia, high palate (sometimes cleft) and abnormal position and malocclusion of the teeth. Blind fistulas between the angles of the ears and the angles of the mouth. Atypical hair growth in the form of a tongue-shaped process of the hairline extending towards the cheeks. Other anomalies such as facial clefts and skeletal deformities. The characteristic faces of the patients have often been described as being bird like or fish like in nature. The syndrome is thought to result from a retardation or failure of differentiation of maxillary mesoderm at and after the 50 mm stage of the embryo. The fact that the teeth of the upper jaw are usually unaffected, and ordinarily are present by the sixth week, is further evidence of retardation or arrest of differentiation at or after the second month of fetal life. The first visceral arch of the visceral mesoderm also advances secondarily to form the mandible, and again retardation occurs on the same basis. A disease that has sometimes been confused with mandibulofacial dysostosis, because of certain clinical features in common is hemifacial microsomia (also known as oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia or Goldenhar syndrome). However, hemifacial microsomia is sporadic in the vast majority of cases, although familial cases have been reported. In addition as the name implies, this disease is unilateral and has been suggested to be related to an abnormality in the vascular supply of the head.

        "exp": "The disease is beta thalassemia major, which is a severe haemolytic anemia characterized by a failure to produce the beta chains of hemoglobin (some HbF, the fetal form of hemoglobin, is produced). The excess alpha chains are insoluble, leading to intra- and extravascular hemolysis. These patients require large numbers of transfusions, and iron overload with resulting secondary hemochromatosis can contribute to eventual cardiac failure. The heart is also damaged by the chronic high output state needed to compensate for the anemia.

An important clinical advance was the recognition that the capillaries in the subcutaneous fat are often involved in patients with systemic amyloidosis and can often provide sufficient tissues for the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Thus, a biopsy of the organ with the most severe clinical involvement is often unnecessary. For example in cardiac amyloidosis, the definitive diagnosis of the type of amyloid can be made using an endomyocardial biopsy specimen with Congo red and immunologic staining of the tissue sample. Alternatively, when a noninvasive testing suggests cardiac amyloidosis - A specific diagnosis is often made by studying a subcutaneous fat aspiration instead of endomyocardial biopsy thereby avoiding an invasive procedure. When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a firm diagnosis, biopsy samples can be collected from other organs. In addition, an advantage to performing a biopsy of an involved organ (e. g., kidney heart) is that it definitively establishes a cause and effect relationship between the organ dysfunction and amyloid. It is important to realize that not all biopsy sites offer the same sensitivity. The best sites of biopsy are: - Abdominal fat pad and (90% sensitivity) Rectal mucosa (73% - 84% sensitivity) Other sites that are often sampled but have poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of amyloid include: - Salivary glands Skin Tongue Gingiva Stomach Bone marrow",

Symptoms of herpes simplex virus infection include watery blisters in the skin or mucous membranes of the mouth, lips or genitals. Lesions heal with a scab characteristic of herpetic disease. However, as neurotropic and neuroinvasive viruses, HSV-1 and -2 persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system in the cell bodies of neurons. After the initial or primary infection, some infected people experience sporadic episodes of viral reactivation or outbreaks. In an outbreak, the virus in a nerve cell becomes active and is transpoed the neuron's axon to the skin, where virus replication and shedding occur and cause new sores.

There is a strong association between type 1 diabetes mellitus and specific HLA-D phenotypes, paicularly HLA-DR3. Also Know: The onset of multiple sclerosis is usually in the years from 20 to 40. Sixty percent of patients are female. There is an increased familial incidence, a 25% concordance in identical twins compared with 2-3% in fraternal twins, and an association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B7 and -DR2.

Sometimes the chamber radius is increased and the wall thickness is increased moderately - this is termed eccentric hyperophy - and can occur when there is both volume and pressure overload.

Subsequent investigations determine that she has idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In this disorder, the low platelet count is due to which of the following?",
        "exp": "ITP is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which antibodies against platelet glycoproteins cause platelet destruction and removal by the reticuloendothelial system. Secondary thrombocytopenia can also be produced by lupus, viral infections, and drugs. Only when secondary thrombocytopenia has been ruled out, can the diagnosis of ITP be made. Defective platelet aggregation is responsible for thrombasthenia, an autosomal dominant disease that causes prolonged bleeding time but normal numbers of platelets. Hypersplenism causes thrombocytopenia when an enlarged spleen traps normal platelets in the absence of other specific platelet disorders. This type of thrombocytopenia can be cured with splenectomy. Although the thrombocytopenia in ITP often improves with splenectomy, ITP does not cause splenomegaly. Megakaryopoiesis is disturbed in any disorder that causes bone marrow failure, including drug toxicity, leukemia, and infections. In this setting, thrombocytopenia is often pa of a pancytopenia.

        "exp": "Ans. D: Celiac disease Celiac sprue/celiac disease/gluten-sensitive enteropathy is a chronic disease of the digestive tract that interferes with the digestion and absorption of food nutrients. People with celiac sprue cannot tolerate gliadin, the alcohol-soluble fraction of gluten. Gluten is a protein commonly found in wheat, rye, and barley. Most patients with celiac disease tolerate oats, but they should be monitored closely. When people with celiac sprue ingest gliadin, the mucosa of their intestines is damaged by an immunologically mediated inflammatory response, resulting in maldigestion and malabsorption. Patients with celiac disease can present with failure to thrive and diarrhea (the classical form). However, some patients have only subtle symptoms (atypical celiac disease) or are asymptomatic (silent celiac disease). Blood for specific screening tests should be drawn before the patient is placed on a gluten-free diet. Current screening tests include IgA antibodies to tissue transaminase, IgA/IgG antigliadin antibodies and IgA antiendomysial antibody. Combined presence of antiendomysial antibody and antigliadin antibody is almost predictive of intestinal mucosal atrophy but if both antibody tests are negative, mucosa is almost normal. Antiendomysial antibody screening is an excellent test for the diagnosis and follow-up of celiac disease and for identification of asymptomatic patients. Antiendomysial antibodies are highly specific but less sensitive than other antibodies. The absence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 is useful for its high negative predictive value, but they are not helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Individuals with celiac disease have a higher than normal rate of malignancy. The most common celiac disease associated malignancy is enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and small intestinal adenocarcinoma.",

Neutrophils remain predominant cells for upto 72 hrs, after which the macrophages take over as predominant cell. Lymphocytes and plasma cells are also seen along with macrophages in the acute inflammatory response. Mast cells may also involve in acute inflammation. There are exceptions to this pattern of cellular reaction:- Pseudomonas infection - Neutrophils predominate over 2 to 4 days. Viral infection --> Lymphocytes are the first cells to arrive. In some hypersensitivity reactions --4 Eosinophils predominate. Why neutrophils are replaced by macrophages? Neutrophils can not regenerate their lysosomal enzymes, so these cells are not capable of sustained activity. On the other hand macrophages can regenerate their lysosomal enzymes and are capable of sustained activity. So, macrophages become the predominant cells after 48-72 hrs to sustaine inflammation. Cells in Chronic inflammation The macrophage is the dominant cellular player in chronic inflammation. Other cells present in chronic inflammation include lymphocytes, plasma cells, Eosinophils, mast cells.

Thrombembolism In thromboembolism, the thrombus is completely or paially detached from the site of thrombus.

Emboli from systemic vein ---> SVC & IVC --> Rt atrium --> Rt ventricle --> Pulmonary circulation Aerial emboli o Most systemic emboli arises from cardiac mural thrombi due to MI of Lt. ventricle.

The most common type of amyloid (type AA) is due to deposition of altered immunoglobulin light chains and is seen in diseases with chronic antigenic stimulation, such as tuberculosis. Acute urinary tract infection is an infection of too sho a duration to cause amyloidosis.

The lesions primarily affect the buccal and labial mucosa, soft palate, and ventral tongue. These lesions have been called \"snail track\" ulcerations, although in most instances, the lesions are probably not truly ulcerated.

Other features are a state of extreme irritability, photophobia with lacrimation, muscular weakness, tachycardia, hypertension, insomnia, gastrointestinal upset and stomatitis.

        "exp": "Cytokeratin Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochennstry is an impoant tool for determination of type of tissue by the presence (or absence) of tissue specific lineage markers. Basic principle of immunohistochemistty is to label an antibody with a probe (coloured marker) which is specific to an antigen of a paicular tissue. - This antibody is run on the tissue of unknown origin. If the tissue has that paicular antigen site (epitope), then the antibody will get attached to the tissue. Because this antibody is labeled, it can be seen under a microscope and the origin of the tissue can be diagnosed. Let's begin the discussion with intermediate filaments: Intermediate filaments are cytoskeleton components of both normal and neoplastic tissue. There are the major antigens used in immunohistochemistry. Five broad classes of intermediate filaments exist. Most neoplasms show a predominant expression of one of these: a) Keratins Carcinomas, mesothelioma and non? seminomous GCT b) Vimentin Sarcoma, melanomas, seminomas, lymphomas c) Neurofilament Neural and neuroendocrine tumours d) Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) Neoplasms of astroglial origin e) Desmin Tumours of muscular origin (leiomyoma and rhabdomyomas) Neoplastic cells can co-express more than one of these intennediate filaments i. e. they may be +ve for 2 markers of different origin. These. findings can also be helpful to diagnose a tumour. After this brief outline let us examine various markers in each neoplasia. Carcinomas Cytokeratins are the most sensitive markers for carcinoma. - These are. fuher subdivided into 20 subtypes based on molecular weight and isoelectric pH. - These individual keratins provide impoant information about site of origin of given carcinoma.

Although microscopic hematuria is frequently present in acute glomerulonephritis, the total amount of blood in the urine is usually not sufficient to result in gross hematuria. Renal trauma can produce enough damage to the renal vasculature to result in the loss of large amounts of blood into the urine and the development of gross hematuria. Ureteral calculi often present with gross hematuria secondary to injury to the mucosa of the ureter. Similarly, injury to the bladder mucosa in acute cystitis can result in considerable blood loss, hence the expression \"hemorrhagic cystitis\". Necrosis of tumor tissue can result in blood loss from bladder neoplasms, which often present with gross hematuria. Ref: Robbins Basic Pathology, 8th Ed, page 554-559",

Stomach cancers are commonly adenocarcinomas (90%). Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (\"back to back\" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically \"empty\" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumor cell, it pushes the nucleus at the purpley\"signet-ring cell\".

However, the capillaries in the subcutaneous fat are aften involved in patients with systemic amyloidosis and can often provide sufficient tissues for the diagnosis of amyloidosis. o Therefore, a needle aspiration biopsy of fat just under the skin of the belly (fat pad aspiration) offers a simple and less invasive method to diagnose systemic amyloidosis and biopsy of the organ with the most severe clinical involvement is often unnecessary. When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a final diagnosis, biopsy samples can be collected from other organs. o The best sites of biopsy are abdominal fat pad (90% sensitivity) and rectal mucosa (70-80% sensitivity).

These are the extra-nodal equivalent of monocytoid (marginal zone) B-cell lymphomas occurring in lymphoid organs such as the lymph node. These lymphomas arise in numerous extranodal sites such as the stomach, salivary gland and thyroid, most of which lack native lymphoid tissue but acquire MALT in close association with chronic inflammation or autoimmune processes. MALT lymphomas appear to have similar clinical, pathological and molecular features regardless of organs of origin. The most common cause of \"pro-lymphomatous\" inflammation in the stomach is chronic H. pylori infection, which is found in association with most cases of gastric MALToma. The most striking evidence linking H. pylori gastritis to MALToma is that eradication of the infection with infection with antibiotics induces durable remissions with low rates of recurrence in most patients.",

Elevated levels of FSPs (most notably fibrin-derived D-dimers) can be used for diagnosing abnormal thrombotic states including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), deep venous thrombosis, or pulmonary thromboembolism. Plasmin is generated by proteolysis of plasminogen, an inactive plasma precursor, either by factor XII or by plasminogen activators.

How, do the cells find out that now the), do'nt need to divide fuher. Cells achieve this through telomer shoening Telomers are sho repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosome that are impoant for ensuring complete replication of chromosome ends. It consists of many arrays of TTAGGG repeats at terminal of 3' ending strand. It confers stability to chromosomes. With each successive division there is some shoening of the telomers. Once the telomers are shoened beyond a ceain point the ends of the chromosome are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. The broken DNA leads to activation of p53 dependent cell cycle check points causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis. Thus telomere shoening functions as a clock that counts cell division. How do the germ cells keep on dividing throughout their life??? In germ cells telomere shoening is prevented by the sustained function of the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomer. It is RNA dependent DNA polymerase. It has one segment that is complimentary to TTAGGG repeat and is used as template for the replication of telomeric sequence. This enzyme is absent from most somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle. Telomerase is present in Germ cells thus explaining the ability of these cells to self replicate extensively. If loss of telomere is the basis of finite life span then how do cancer cells continue to divide actively???? In cancer cells telomerase activity is reactivated. Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 90% of human tumours. Thus telomerase activity and maintenance of telomere length are essential for the replicative potential in cancer cells.",

On physical examination, subungual splinter hemorrhages and a systolic murmur are detected. Blood cultures are positive for Staphylococcus aureus. She died of myocardial infarction on her third hospital day. Which of the following was the underlying condition leading to the patient's demise?",
        "exp": "Infective endocarditis leads to formation of bulky and friable vegetations on the valvular leaflets. The vegetations are composed of fibrin, neutrophils, and colonies of bacteria that cause erosion of underlying cardiac structures. Fragments of infected vegetations may detach and cause pulmonary or systemic septic embolism. Splinter hemorrhages in the nail bed and petechiae in skin and mucosae are also due to microscopic septic emboli. In this case, myocardial infarction was probably due to a septic embolus in the coronary circulation. If infective endocarditis is due to a virulent organism such as Staphylococcus aureus (a common cause of endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers), a tumultuous clinical course ensues, associated with high moality. With less virulent organisms, such as Streptococci viridans, Subacute infective endocarditis is the resultant clinical picture. Subacute endocarditis arises in patients with previously malformed or damaged valves and is associated with a slower course and a better prognosis. Also Know: Carcinoid heart disease is caused by serotonin-producing carcinoids in the liver or lungs. Fibrosis of the endocardium ensues, affecting the right heart in the case of hepatic carcinoids and the left heart for pulmonary carcinoids. Thickening and rigidity of valvular leaflets are characteristic gross findings. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a non-infective form of endocarditis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The vegetations are small and regularly aligned along the valvular margins. Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis was previously known as marantic endocarditis, being associated with debilitating conditions such as disseminated neoplasms. Increased coagulability is probably the underlying pathogenesis. The lesions are small vegetations similar to Libman-Sacks endocarditis.

In Wilson disease, main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. Liver disease may present as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and poal hypertension. On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia. About half the patients with Wilson's have neurological or psychiatric problems. Specific neurological symptoms then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (increased rigidity and slowing of routine movements) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of pa of the body). Various medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease: Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible around the iris. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea. They do not occur in all patients and may only be visible on slit lamp examination. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts, brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis, a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the PCT leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), weakening of the bone (due to calcium and phosphate loss) and occasionally aminoaciduria. Heart: cardiomyopathy and arrythmias. Hormones: hypoparathyroidism, infeility and habitual aboion.",

The measurement of plasma catecholamines can also be of value in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. However, the measurement of plasma catecholamines has limited sensitivity and specificity.

Natural killer cells (NK Cells) Possess spontaneous cytotoxicity towards various target cells: - (i) Virus infected cells (ii) Malignant cells (iii) Transplanted foreign cells Cytotoxicity is not antibody dependent or MHC restricted o Activity is nonimmune as it does not require sensitization by prior antigenic contact. They have CD-56 and CD-16 on their surface o 1L-2 acts as a growth factor o Natural killer cell activity is augmented by interferon. o They release perforin which causes transmembrane pores through which TNF-I3 enters the cell and induce apoptosis. o NK cells are activated to LAK cells in the presence of IL-2 o Usually CD-3 negative but subset of NK cells are CD-3 positive called NK/T cells. o NK cells secrete TNF-a, GMCSF, perforin, IL-4. o NK cells do not kill normal cells. Why is it so? lets see:? The NK cells express activating and inhibiting receptors. The functional activity of the NK cells is regulated by a balance between signal from these receptors. MHC class I molecules has inhibiting signal on NK cells and normal cell are not killed because inhibiting signals from normal MHC class I molecules overside activating signals. The ability of NK cells to kill target cells is inversly related to target cell expression of MHC class I molecule. If virus infection or neoplastic transformation reduces the expression of MHC I, inhibitory signals are interrupted and lysis of target cells occur. 3.

Circulating ceruloplasmin is desialylated as pa of normal plasma protein aging.

It is also seen with other types of injury e. g., liver necrosis in viral hepatitis, Coagulative necrosis of skin after burns (Thermal injury). Why there are predominant protein denaturation and no enzymatic digestion? Hypoxia causes intracellular acidosis (has been explained earlier) -> 4 pH results in denaturation of proteins which includes not only structural proteins but also enzymes -> So, there is no enzymatic digestion Liquefactive necrosis It is the necrotic degradation of tissue that rapidly undergoes softening and liquefaction because of the action of hydrolytic enzymes. It occurs after 1. Infection Le., suppurative inflammation (most common). 2. Ischemic necrosis in the brain. Note: Brain lacks any substantial supportive stroma, so ischemic necrosis in the brain is liquefactive, unlike other organs where it is coagulative. Mechanism of liquefactive necrosis -> Microbes stimulates accumulation of inflammatory cells and these cells to release lysosomal enzymes. Caseous necrosis It is a variant of coagulative necrosis. It is most commonly encountered when cell death is attributable to certain organisms e. g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and fungi (Histoplasma, Coccidioidomycosis). Why is it called caseous necrosis, not coagulative necrosis?

Electron micrographic studies show that the tumors are the result of the proliferation of fibroblasts or Schwann cells in the peripheral nerves, possibly due to ras inactivation. There is no treatment, except for surgical resection of symptomatic tumors. Ependymoma can occur wherever ependymal cells are found. They are more common in children, and most often originate in the fouh ventricle. They are the most common intramedullary glioma of the spinal cord. Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by severe degeneration of the caudate nucleus along with degenerative changes in the putamen and coex. In addition to chorea, these patients frequently suffer from athetoid movements, progressive dementia, and behavioral disorders. Marfan syndrome is due to a defect in the gene for fibrillin.

It is usually due to the reactivation of old lesions or gradual progression of primary tuberculosis into chronic form. The characteristics of secondary tuberculosis include extensive tissue damages due to immunologic reactions of the host to tubercle bacilli and their products. Primary vs Secondary Tuberculosis. When a host has first contact with tubercle bacilli:- An acute exudative lesion develops and rapidly spreads to the lymphatics and regional lymph nodes.- The exudative lesion in tissue often heals rapidly.- The lymph node undergoes caseation, which usually calcifies.- The tuberculin test becomes positive. If the primary lesion could not contained rapidly, the appearance of hypersensitivity to tuberculin provokes a dramatic change in the host's response to the organisms. The nonspecific inflammatory response evoked on first exposure to tubercle bacilli becomes granulomatous, evoking the formation of tubercles. The tubercle comprises an organized aggregation of enlarged macrophages that, because they resemble epithelial cells, are referred to as epithelioid cells. A peripheral collar of fibroblasts, macrophages, and lymphocytes surrounds the granuloma. Frequently the central region of epithelioid cells undergoes a characteristic caseous necrosis to produce a \"soft\" tubercle, the most characteristic hallmark of tuberculosis. When the antigen load at the initial infection site and regional lymph node is large, caseation necrosis may develop and lesions may later calcify. These calcified lesions of the primary site are referred to as the Ghon complex. After the development of hypersensitivity, the infection becomes quiescent and asymptomatic in the majority of patients (about 90%). In some, however, especially the very young and adults who are immunocompromised or who have other predisposing illnesses, the primary infection may evolve into clinical disease. The progression may be local at the site of the primary lesion, or it may be at one or more distant sites where bacilli have arrived during the early hematogenous spread. In a small number of persons whose initial tuberculous infection subsidies, secondary disease occurs in spite of acquired cellular immunity. In this phase of the disease, lesions are usually localized in the apices of the lungs (remember that tubercle bacilli require oxygen for growth). In about 5% of patients, apical pulmonary tuberculosis manifests itself within 2 years of the primary infection. Because of the acquired cellular immunity, bacilli are more promptly phagocytized and destroyed by the activated macrophages. As a result, in secondary tuberculosis, lesions remain localized and dissemination of organisms the lymphatic vessels is usually prevented. Hypersensitivity promotes a more rapid caseation and fibrotic walling-off of the focus. Histologically the reaction is characteristic of tubercle formation, manifested by a local accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages. T lymphocytes and their chemotactic lymphokines play a major role in the development of tuberculous granuloma. These differences between primary infection and post-primary or reactivation are attributed to (1) resistance and (2) hypersensitivity induced by the first infection of the host with tubercle bacilli.",

P, acute and chronic both are autoimmune disorders in which platelet destruction results from formation of antiplatelet antibodies. Pathogenesis Chronic ITP is caused by the formation of autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoproteins most often or Ib-IX. In overwhelming majority of cases the antiplatelet antibodies are of the IgG class. The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar to that seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Opsonized platelets are rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. The spleen is the major site of the destruction of platelets. Pathology The principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic. The point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in spleen. the spleen size remains normal. On histological examination there is congestion of the sinusoids and hyperactivity and enlargement of the splenic follicles manifested by the formation of prominent germinal centres. Sometimes scattered megakaryocytes are found within the sinuses and sinusoidal walls. This represents a very mild form of extramedullary hematopoiesis. These splenic findings are not sufficiently distinctive to be considered diagnostic. Bone Marrow Bone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes. These findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction. The impoance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure. A decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I. T. P.",

        "question": "Autoimmunity is caused by?",
        "exp": "Ans, is 'c' i. e., Negative selection of T cells in thymus Autoimmunity Autoimmunity is the reactivity of the body towards self antigen i. e. the immune system stas to consider the host cell as foreign antigen and mounts an immune response against it. Normally the immune system does not show any reactivity to self antigen. They are able to discriminate between foreign antigen and host cell. This is called immune tolerance or self tolerance How does immune tolerance develop? The immune system removes cells which show self reactivity to antigens. The process of removing these cells is broadly classified into two categories. a) Central tolerance b) Peripheral tolerance a) Central tolerance The premature lymphocytes which are self reactive are killed in the central organs i. e. organs where they mature (i. e. Bone marrow in case of B lymphocytes and Thymus in case of T lymphocytes) This process is called central deletion or negative selection i. e. the process which does not allow self reactive cells to grow. Sometimes instead of killing the self reactive cells only their receptors are deleted, this is called central editing or receptor editing. b) Peripheral tolerance Central tolerance is not able to kill all the premature self reactive cells. Some cells escape central tolerance; they mature and move out in the peripheral lymphoid system. The mechanism by which these cells are inactivated or removed in the peripheral lymphoid system is called peripheral tolerance. There are five main mechanisms operating in peripheral tolerance, these are: i) Anergy This refers to prolonged or irreversible functional inactivation of self reactive lymphocytes ii) Suppression by regulatory T cells Sometimes regulatory cells are present to suppress the self reactive T lymphocytes iii) Clonal deletion by activation induced cell death Self reactive lymphocytes receive signals that promote their death by apoptosis iv) Antigen Sequestration Some self reactive lymphocytes cannot react against the host cells because these cells or antigens are located in the tissues which do not communicate with blood e. g. testis, eye, and brain. These sites are called immune privileged sites, because it is difficult to induce immune response to antigen in these sites. v) Cytokine activation So, these are the layers of self tolerance for an autoimmune disease to develop in the body, these layers of self tolerance should be disrupted or bypassed. Mechanism of development of Autoimmunity 1. Exogenous a) Molecular mimicry - Cross reactivity between a microbial product and a self antigen might lead to activation of autoreactive lymphocytes. b) Superantigenic stimulation - Microbial superantigens, such as staphylococcal protein 'A' and enterotoxin, can stimulate a broad range of T and B cells irresepetive of their antigen specificity. c) Microbial adj uvanticity - Infectious agent may be able to overcome self tolerance because they possess molecules, such as bacterial endotoxin, that have adjuvant like effect which enhances immunogenicity of autoantigen. 2. Endogenous A. Altered antigen presention a) Loss of immunologic privilege - If the privileged site are damaged by trauma or inflammation, the sequestrated autoantigens (lens, brain protein) communicate with blood and lead to activation of autoreactive lymphocytes. b) Presentation of Cryptic epitopes (option b) - Protein determinants (eiptopes) of an antigen is not routinely seen by lymphocytes (cryptotic epitopes) are recognized as a result of immunologic reactivity to associated molecules. Infections may release and damage self antigen and expose epitopes of this antigen that are normally concealed from immune system, i. e., cryptic epitopes. c) Alteration of self antigen - Inflammation of drug exposure may cause a primary chemical alteration in proteins which may be recognized as autoantigen. d) Enhanced function of antigen presenting cells by costimulatory molecular expression and cytokine production may cause autoimmunity. Increased T cell help - Intese stimulation of T-cells can produce nonspecific signals that bypass the need for antigen-specific helper T cells and lead to polyclonal B cell activation with formation of multiple autoantibodies. Increased B cell function - Nonspecific stimulation of polyclonal B cell by B cell activators, such as bacterial endotoxin, may also lead to production of autoantibodies. Apoptotic defect - Clones of cells that had immunological reactivity with self antigen are eliminated during embryonic life by apoptosis. Such clones are called \"forbedden clones\". This negative selection of autoreactive T cells in the thymus requires expression of the autoimmune regular (AIRE) gene that enables the expression of tissue specific proteins of tissue specific ptoeins in thymic medullary cells. Peptides from these proteins are expressed in context of MHC molecules and mediate the elimination of autoreactive T cells. The absence of AIRE gene interferes expression of proteins in context MHC molecules and leads to failure of negative selection of autoreactive T cells. E Cytokine imbalance - Diminished production of IL-10 and TNF can lead to autoimmunity due to diminished inhibitory effect on autoreactive lymphocytes. F. Altered immunoregulation - Defect in the generation and expression of regulatory T cell activity may allow for the production of autoimmunity.",

Hyperplasia occurs when there is increased trophic stimulation (e. g., hormones, growth factors), increased functional demand, or persistent cell injury. Only labile and stable cells undergo hyperplasia; labile cells have stern cells that frequently divide, and stable cells have resting cells that are stimulated to enter the cell cycle. The presence of increased goblet cells in the mainstem bronchus of a smoker is an example of hyperplasia, because goblet cells are normally present in this area. However, their presence in the terminal bronchiole or gastric mucosa, where they are not normally found, is an example of metaplasia. Squamous epithelium in the bladder of a patient with Schistosoma haernatobium is an example of metaplasia, because the epithelium of a normal bladder is transitional. Irritation from the eggs of the schistosomes induces squamous metaplasia and the potential for dysplasia and squamous carcinoma. A distal esophagus with glandular epithelium intermixed with squamous epithelium is an example of Barrett esophagus. Chronic acid injury to the distal esophagus from gastroesophageal reflux stimulates the formation of mucoussecreting glandular epithelium, which is a type of glandular metaplasia and predisposes the patient to adenocarcinoma. Goblet and Paneth cells in the glands of the gastric mucosa is called intestinal metaplasia and is commonly seen in chronic atrophic gastritis of the body and fundus (type A) or pylorus and antrum (type B). It is a precursor lesion of adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Squamous epithelium in the mains tern bronchus of a smoker is squamous metaplasia, because normal epithelium is pseudostratifiecl, ciliated, and columnar.

It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma and is the most frequent sarcoma associated with radiotherapy. The tumor occurs more commonly in males and more frequently in the age group of 5th to 7th decades. Most common locations are the lower and upper extremities and retroperitoneum. It begins as a painless, enlarging mass, generally in relation to skeletal muscle, deep fascia or subcutaneous tissue.

        "exp": "Genetic polymorphism The occurrence of different DNA sequence in at least 1% of population, i. e. presence of more than one genetically distinct types in single population of a species. In very simple words, genetic polymorphism causes diversity between individuals, e. g. genetic polymorphism might give rise to blue eyes versus brown eyes, or straight hair versus curly hair. It should be noted that in genetic polymorphism there is variability in DNA sequence; However, the individuals are normal (not diseased); and this differentiate genetic polymorphism from mutation. The, term \"mutation\", as opposed to \"polymorphism\", is generally used to refer to changes in DNA sequence which have been associated with disease (or a risk of disease) and are not present in most individuals of a species (present in less than 0. 5-1% of individuals, in contrast to genetic polymorphism). Two types of genetic polymorphisms are there: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) -> as the name suggest there is variation in a single nucleotide in every stretch of approximately 1000 base pairs. Repeat-length Polymorphism -> In contrast to SNPs there are short repetitive sequences of variation: Microsatellites -> Repeat size of 2-6 base pairs and less than 1 kilobase. Minisatellites -> 15 to 70 base pairs and 1-3 kilobase. Most common type of polymorphism is single nucleotide polymorphis (SNP). These types of base substitutions are frequently encountered during genetic testing and should be differentiated from true mutation that alter protein expression. The best example of genetic polymorphism is blood groups.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Hereditary spherocytosis The normal red blood cell is a relatively impermeable biconcave disc which maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic, fluid will be taken into the cell to maintain stability. Eventually under very hypotonic conditions the cell will fill to capacity and rupture. Spherocytic red blood cells have a decreased capacity to expand, and will rupture in mildly hypotonic conditions that fail to lyse normal red cells. They thus exhibit increased osmotic fragility. Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solution. With the unincubated test, red cell osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occurs in a sodium chloride concentration > 0. 5%. Although increased osmotic fragility is characteristically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it may also be increased in other types of hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of spherocytes, paicularly auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and in hypernatermia (Na > 155 meq/L). Often the increased osmotic fragility in spherocytosis is limited to a small fraction of cells that are unusually susceptible to lysis. After incubation, the defect is magnified, and a striking increase in fragility will be seen in hereditary spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if hemolysis is not complete in a 0. 30% Na. C1 solution. Decreased osmotic fragility is associated with chronic liver disease, iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hyponatremia (Na < 130 meq/ L), polycythemia vera, and sickle cell anemia after splenectomy.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Myofibroblasts. Wound contraction is a feature of healing by secondary intention. This is the feature that most clearly differentiates primary from secondary healing. Contraction has been ascribed to the presence of myofibroblasis - altered fibroblasts that have the ultrastructual characteristics of smooth muscle cells. In above explanation, I have explained healing in general. Here I am giving brief description of wound healing. Skin wound healing. Skin wounds are classically described to heal by primary or secondary intention. A. Healing by primary intention. It occurs in wounds with opposed edges, e. g., surgical incision. The healing process follows a series of sequantial steps:? Immediate after incision. Incisional space filled with blood containing fibrin and blood cells. Dehydration of the surface clot forms scab that covers the wound. Within 24 hours. Neutrophils appear at the margins of wound. In 24-48 hours. Epithelial cells move from the wound edges along the cut margin of dermis, depositing basement membrane components as they move. They fuse in the midline beneath the surface scab, producing a continuous but thin epithelium layer that closes the wound. By day 3. Neutrophils are largely replaced by macrophages. Granulation tissue progressively invades the incision space. Collegen fibers now present in the margin but do not bridge the incision. ci By day SIncisional space is largely filled with granulation tissue. Neovascularization is maximum. Collegen fibrils become more abundant and begin to bridge the incision. The epidermis recovers its normal thickness. Et During second week. Leukocytes and edema have disappeared. There is continued accumulation of collegen and proliferation of fibroblast. o By the end of first month. Scar is made up of a cellular connective tissue devoid of inflammatory infiltrate covered now by intact epidermis. B. Healing by secondary intention. It occurs in wounds with seperated edges in which there is more extensive loss of cells and tissue. Regeneration of parenchymal cells cannot completely restore the original architecture, and hence abundant granulation tissue grows. Healing by secondary intention differ from primary intention in several respects:? 1. Inflammatory reaction is more intense. 2. Much larger amounts of granulation tissue are formed. 3. Wound contraction occurs --> Feature that most clearly differentiate secondary from primary healing. Permanent wound contraction requires the action of myolifibroblasts - Fibroblasts that have the ultrastructural characteristic of smooth muscle cells.",

MYC protein is rapidly translocated to the nucleus, sometimes as a dimer with another protein, called MAX. This heterodimer binds to DNA sequences in target genes and is a potent transcriptional activator. The range of activities attributed to MYC includes histone acetylation, reduced cell adhesion and increased cell motility, increased protein synthesis, and decreased proteinase activity. The MYC protooncogene contains separate sequences that encode the growth promoting and apoptotic activities. In contrast to the regulated expression of MYC during normal cell proliferation, persistent expression, and in some cases overexpression, of the MYC protein is commonly found in tumors. This may lead to sustained transcription of critical target genes and subsequent neoplastic transformation. Dysregulation of MYC expression resulting from translocation of the gene occurs in Burkitt lymphoma. MYC is amplified in some cases of breast, colon, lung, and many other carcinomas. The related N-MYC and L-MYC genes are amplified in neuroblastomas and small cell cancers of the lung, respectively.",

However, other cytogenetic variants may be responsible, especially 46. XY/47. XXY mosaicism. The principal pathological abnormality is dysgenesis of the seminiferous tubules. This is evident from infancy (and possibly even in utero) and progresses with age. By adolescence, hyalinisation and \ufb01brosis are present within the seminiferous tubules and Leydig cell function is impaired, resulting in hypogonadism. Clinical features The diagnosis is typically made in adolescents who have presented with gynecomastia and failure to progress normally through puberty. Affected individuals usually have small, \ufb01rm testes. Tall stature is apparent from early childhood, re\ufb02ecting characteristically long leg length associated with 47. XXY, and may be exacerbated by androgen de\ufb01ciency with lack of epiphyseal closure in puberty. Other clinical features may include learning dif\ufb01culties and behavioral disorders, as well as an increased risk of breast cancer and type 2 diabetes in later life. The spectrum of clinical features is wide and some individuals, especially those with 46. XY/47. XXY mosaicism, may pass through puberty normally and be identi\ufb01ed only during investigation for infertility. Klinefelter's syndrome is suggested by the typical phenotype in a patient with hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism and can be con\ufb01rmed by karyotype analysis.

Thalassemia screening o Widespead prevalence of thalessemia has led to a pressing demand for community screening. o Various methods for screening of thalassemia trait are available which include peripheral smear examination, RBC indices, Meintzer's fraction, discriminant functions, NESTROFT etc. o NESTROFT TEST is used in many centres in India for screening of thalassemia trait. o If mother is NESTROFT positive, the confirmatory test for Hb. A2 is done for mother and the father is subjected to screening by NESTROFT. If father is also NESTROFT positive, confirmatory test for Hb. A2 is done for father. o If both the parents have thalessemia trait, there is 1: 4 chance of fetus having thalassemia major. o Therefore, prenatal diagnosis is done by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in first trimester. o If CVS confirms the fetus to be having thalasemia major, termination of pregnancy is indicated after counseling the parents. o If the fetus has thalassemia minor (trait), pregnancy is continued as such and baby will have normal lifespan. o It is woh noting here that a positive NESTROFT test is seen in other conditions beside beta thalassemia trait. These are iron deficiency anemia, alpha thalassemia trait, homozygous and heterozygous HbE, HbS as well as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. o Therefore, a positive NESTROFT test should always be followed by a confirmatory test for HBA2 (eg. serum electrophoresis).",

Note: Epitope is the portion of an antigen that actually binds with antibody.

Secondary antiphospholipid syndrome When antiphospholipid syndrome is associated with SLE and other autoimmune disease like sjogren syndrome, RA, Bechet syndrome, systemic sclerosis etc. 2. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome When antiphopholipid syndrome develops without associated SLE.

On admission, her temperature is 38. 7 C (102 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, Pulse is 98/min, and Respiratory rate is 20/min. She appears disoriented to time and place. Physical examination reveals jaundiced sclerae and skin, purpura on the trunk, and bleeding gums. Her platelet count is 25, 000/mm3, hematocrit is 24%, and creatinine is 4. 9 mg/dL. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and indirect bilirubin are elevated. Coagulation tests are within normal limits, but the bleeding time is increased; fibrin-split products and Coombs test are negative. A peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes, helmet-shaped cells, and cells with a triangular shape. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology. It is characterized by an increased bleeding time but a decreased platelet count. It causes purpura, fever, renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and microthrombi, frequently in young women. Elevated indirect bilirubin and high LDH are characteristic, as are schistocytes in the blood smear, renal dysfunction, and neurologic and systemic symptoms. Negative findings impoant to rule out similar conditions include a negative Coombs test and absence of fibrin split products. TTP is thought to be initiated by endothelial injury, which releases ceain procoagulant materials into the circulation, causing platelet aggregation. This condition may be precipitated by pregnancy or use of estrogens. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia can cause anemia and an elevated indirect bilirubin, but generally produces only mild symptoms, is not associated with thrombocytopenia, and does not cause fragmentation of red blood cells on the peripheral smear. The negative Coombs test argues against autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation can be differentiated from TTP because of abnormal coagulation tests. In DIC, microangiopathic hemolysis is also present, but the prothrombin time (PT) and paial thromboplastin time (PTT) are prolonged, fibrinogen levels are reduced, and fibrin split products are elevated. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome is not significantly different from TTP. The two conditions, in fact, are considered manifestations of the same pathogenetic spectrum.
