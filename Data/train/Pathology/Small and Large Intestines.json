Both small intestine and colon are involved in 30% of cases, and only colon is involved in 30%. In the affected segment, mesenteric fat wraps around the bowel surface - creeping fato The intestinal wall is rubbery and thick, as a consequence of edema, inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy of the muscularis propria - lumen is almost always narrowed - string sign on barium mealo There are serpentine linear ulcer along the axis of bowel. o As the intervening mucosa tends to be relatively spared, the mucosa acquires a coarse texture - Cobblestone appearance. o There is transmural inflammation affecting all layers of bowel wall. o Sarcoid like noncaseating granulomas may be present in all tissue layerso Neutrophilic infiltration into the crypts results in formation of crypt abscesso On barium enema there is Hose pipe (lead pipe) appearance and cobble - stone appearanceo Screening test is presence of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisae antibody (ASCA).

        "exp": "Ans, is 'C' i. e., ileum o Most common site of intestinal T. B. is ileum. o Tuberculosis of the small intestine occurs in two forms, o Primary infection is usually due to bovine strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis and results from ingesting infected milk. In India the human strain may also cause such primary tuberculosis. This produces hyperplastic tuberculosis. o Secondary infection occurs due to swallowing of tubercle bacilli in a patient with pulmonar\\! tuberculosis. This leads to ulcerative tuberculosis, the more common form of intestinal tuberculosis, o Hyperplastic tuberculosiso Caused by ingestion of mycobacterium tuberculosis by pts with a high resistance to the organism. The infection established itself in lymphoid follicles and the resulting chronic inflammation causes thickening of the intestinal wall and narrowing of the lumen. There is early involvement of the regional lymph nodes which may caseate. o Untreated sooner or later subacute intestinal obstruction will supervene often together with the impaction of an enterolith in the narrowed lumen, o It usually occurs in the ileocecal region, o Clinical features. Attacks of acute abdominal pain with intermittent diarrhoea. Sometimes the presenting picture is of a mas in the rt iliac fossa in a pt with vague ill health. Features of blind loop syndrome may develop due to stasis, distention and chronic infection in the segment of ileum proximal to obstruction. o Barium meal radiography will reveal. Persistent narrowing of the affected segment ie the terminal ileum and the caecum. The caecum is pulled up and may become subhepatic. As the caecum is pulled up the ileo-caeca! angle is widened. Normal ileo-caecat angle is 90o. In ileocaecal tuberculosis this angle may increase upto 150o. o Treatment: This depends on the presence or absence of obstructive symptoms. A TT is given both cases. If obstruction is present ileocaecal resection is best method of t/t (along with ATT)o Thus, all the options are correct in this question but (d) option is partly correct as conservative nv'n is not the t/t of choice. The t/t of choice depends on the presence or absense of obstructive sympt. In case of obstruction, surgery is the t/t of choice, o Ulcerative tuberculosiso It is usually secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis and results from swallowing tubercle bacilli in the sputum (cf. Hyperplastic tuberculosis is usually primary there is no pulmonary tuberculosis), o Usually longer parts of the terminal ileum is involved. o There are multiple ulcers in the terminal ileum lying transversely o Pt presents with diarrhoea and wt loss. o Barium meal shows - absence of filling of the lower ileum, caecum and most of the ascending colon as a result of narrowing and hypermotility of the ulcerated segment, o TreatmentA course of A TT is adequate. Operation is rarely required, in rare events of perforation or intestinal obstruction.",
