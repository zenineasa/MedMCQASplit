After 12 hours, the axons first appear dilated, then club-shaped and finally appear as round balls known as 41retraction balls\", which indicates transected axons. The number of retraction balls begins to decrease 2 to 3weeks after injury, and clusters of microglial cells appear, followed by astrocytosis and demyelinisation\"- Reddy 27th/223.
