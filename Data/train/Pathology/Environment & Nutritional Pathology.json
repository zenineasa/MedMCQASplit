Hyperthermia is another complication with \"excited delirium\" in some cases of cocaine intoxication. The callus is caused by flicking a lighter for use of a crack cocaine pipe. Amphetamines are CNS stimulants. Barbiturates are CNS depressants. Acute ethanolism may lead to CNS depression, but it does not have serious immediate cardiac effects. Opiates can depress CNS and respiratory function, and heroin may produce acute pulmonary edema. Marijuana (with active agent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) has no serious acute toxicities.

About 5% to 8% of obese adults have a mutation in the MC4R gene, and even though there are abundant fat stores and plenty of leptin, the lack of MC4R to drive energy consumption leads to weight gain. Leptin is the product of the ob gene, and mutations reduce leptin levels that signal satiety, but such mutations are rare. Mutations in OB-R encoding the leptin receptor are seen in about 3% of cases of early-onset obesity with hyperphagia in children. POMC is in a catabolic pathway stimulated by leptin, but mutations are rare, and affected individuals typically have childhood-onset with hyperphagia.

On arrival, the patient is in a state of respiratory depression. He experiences convulsions for 2 minutes, followed by cardiac arrest. Advanced cardiac life support measures are instituted, and he is stabilized and intubated. On physical examination, there are needle tracks in the left antecubital fossa, miosis, and a loud diastolic heart murmur. His temperature is 39.2deg C. Use of which of the following substances by this man most likely produced these findings?",
        "exp": "Heroin is an opiate narcotic that is a derivative of morphine. Opiates are central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and overdoses are accompanied by respiratory depression, convulsions, and cardiac arrest. The typical mode of administration is by injection. An infection, such as endocarditis explaining his heart murmur, often results from such use because the nonsterile injection technique is employed. Cocaine is most often inhaled rather than injected, and acutely produces a state of excited delirium. Ethanol is typically ingested and, in excess, can lead to coma and death. Flurazepam is most often ingested; excessive use can lead to respiratory depression. Meperidine is an analgesic that can cause respiratory depression and bradycardia in overdosage. Phencyclidine (PCP) is a schizophrenomimetic and is usually ingested; users have a history of erratic behavior. Lysergic acid (LSD) is a hallucinogen.",

Metaplasia may be of two types1. Epithelial metaplasia* Here one type of adult epithelium is replaced by another type of adult epithelium. It may be :-a) Squamous metaplasia# It occurs most frequently in respiratory tract as a result of chronic irritation by cigarette smoking. The columnar epithelium is replaced by squamous epithelium. This squamous metaplasia represents an attempt by the host to repair or prepare an epithelial tissue that has been damaged by environmental toxicants with a more resistant tissue.# Squamous metaplasia is also encountered in other location such as pancreatic duct (Vit A deficiency, stones in pancreatic duct), gall bladder (gall stones), urinary bladder (bladder calculi, Schistosomiasis), and in endocervix.# Though the metaplasia is reversible, if the influences that predispose to metaplasia is persistent, malignant transformation may occur in metaplastic epithelium.b) Glandular metaplasia# It is a change of the squamous epithelium to glandular (columnar) epithelium e.g. development of Barrett's esophagus, i.e., Stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by gastric columnar epithelium. It is due to reflux of acid contents of stomach into esophagus. This necessitates the replacement of susceptible squamous epithelium of the lower third of esophagus with gastric acid resistant glandular epithelium.2. Connective tissue metaplasia* This transformation occurs between the mesodermally derived tissues i.e., one type of connective tissue is replaced by another type of connective tissue. This is characterized by conversion of fibroblast-derived soft tissue into muscle, Cartilage or bone. Example-Bone formation in muscle i.e., myositis ossificans.",
