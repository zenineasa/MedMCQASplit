Administration of uterotonic soon after bih of baby. Delayed cord clamping and cutting. Controlled cord traction for delivery of the placenta (Brandt Andrew&; s. Method). Uterine massage. Uterotonic Agents Used in AMTSLInjectable oxytocin is the first line agent as it is effective after 2-3 minutes and has minimal side effects. Recommended dose by WHO is 10 units IM. Injectable methylergometrine (methergine) 0. 2 mg IM/IV delivery of anterior shoulder or immediately after DELIVERY OF BABY. Syntometrine or Oxymatrine (ERGOMETRINE 0. 5 MG +OXYTOCIN 5 UNITS) IM after delivery of the baby. Misoprostol 600 microgram tablet orally or rectally (in home delivery). Oral administration of misoprostol should be reversed for situations when the safe administration and/or appropriate storageconditions for injectable oxytocin and ergot alkaloids are not possible. Cord Clamping. Early cord clamping which was included originally in AMTSL not recommended now. Delayed cord clamping is now recommended and not immediate cord clamping. Current evidence shows that delayed cord clamping is beneficial for the baby. Immediate cord clamping has been shown to increase the incidence of iron deficiency and anemia. For premature and low bih weight babies immediate cord clamping can also increase the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage and late-onset sepsis. Controlled Cord Traction. Recommended intervention for delivery of the placenta and a well-documented intervention in the active management of third stage of labour.

The degree of diaphragmatic weakness is best quantitated by measuring trans diaphragmatic pressures. Treatment of choice is assisted ventilation for all or pa of each day. If the nerve to the diaphragm is intact, diaphragmatic pacing may be a ble alternative. Unilateral palsy is MC than bilateral, MC cause is nerve invasion from malignancy, usually a bronchogenic carcinoma. Diagnosis is suggested by an elevated hemidiaphragm on the CXR. Confirmation is best established with the \"sniff test\"(when the patient is observed with fluoroscopy while sniffing, then paralyzed diaphragm will move paradoxically upward due to the negative intrathoracic pressure). Patients with unilateral paralyzed diaphragm are usually asymptomatic, vital capacity and total lung capacity is reduced about 25%.

        "exp": "Hypothermia during anesthesia. Mild hypothermia is extremely common during Anaesthesia and surgery. The physiological effects of hypothermia may have significant potential for detrimental effects on patient well-being. Major consequences of inadveent hypothermia include morbid myocardial events, reduced resistance to surgical wound infection, impaired coagulation, delayed recovery, and postoperative shivering. Heat loss occurs primarily from the skin of a patient to the environment through several processes, including radiation, conduction and convection, and evaporation. Hypothermia decreases the overall metabolic rate by 8% per degc to about half the normal rate at 28degC. Oxygen demand drops. This allows aerobic metabolism to continue through greater periods of compromised oxygen supply, thereby reducing the production of anaerobic byproducts such as superoxide radicals and lactate. Hypothermia lowers intracranial pressures and cerebral perfusion pressure. Warming of fluids can only help to minimize heat loss. (Refer: <a href=\"",

Several mechanisms silence potentially autoreactive T and B cells in peripheral tissues Anergy: Lymphocytes that recognize self-antigens may be rendered functionally unresponsive, a phenomenon called anergy.

Combined spinal-epidural analgesia during labour using intrathecal fentanyl 25 mcg produces good analgesia without major hemodynamic changes during the first stage of labour. During the second stage of labour, only the uterine contractile force should be allowed rather than the maternal expulsive effo that is always associated with the Valsalva maneuver. Therefore, the second stage of delivery should be cut sho by instrumentation. Supplementary analgesia for instrumentation with slow epidural boluses of fentanyl and a low concentration of bupivacaine reduces SVR and the cardiac pre-load. One of the major advantages of epidural analgesia is that it can be administered in incremental doses and that the total dose could be titrated to the desired sensory level. This coupled with the slower onset of anesthesia, allows the maternal cardiovascular system to compensate for the occurrence of sympathetic blockade, resulting in a lower risk of hypotension and decreased uteroplacental perfusion. Moreover, the segmental blockade spares the lower extremity \"muscle pump, \" aiding in venous return, and also decreases the incidence of thromboembolic events. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring, judicious intravenous administration of crystalloid and administration of small bolus doses of phenylephrine maintain maternal hemodynamic stability.

Diagnosis of Soft tissue sarcoma. STS tends to grow along fascial planes, with the surrounding soft tissue compressed to form a pseudocapsule. Clinical behavior of STS is determined by: Anatomic location (depth), grade & sizeM/C route of spread in soft tissue sarcoma: HematogenousM/C site of metastasis: Lung. Core-cut or true-cut biopsy (CT or USG guided) is diagnostic. Incisional biopsy is done if core-cut biopsy is non-diagnostic. FNAC: To confirm or rule out presence of metastatic focus or local recurrence. MRI: IOC for assessing extremity STSCECT: IOC for assessing retroperitoneal sarcoma. Clinical features. TreatmentM/C symptom of STS: Painless mass. Size at presentation is dependent on the location of tumor. Smaller tumors - distal extremities. Larger tumors - proximal extremity & retroperitoneum.

Autophagy is a highly conserved process that degrades ceain intracellular contents in both physiological and pathological conditions. Autophagy-related proteins (ATG) are key players in this pathway, among which ATG5 is indispensable in both canonical and non-canonical autophagy. Recent studies demonstrate that ATG5 modulates the immune system and crosstalks with apoptosis. However, our knowledge of the pathogenesis and regulatory mechanisms of autophagy in various immune related diseases is lacking. Thus, a deeper understanding of ATG5&; s role in the autophagy mechanism may shed light on the link between autophagy and the immune response, and lead to the development of new therapies for autoimmune diseases and autoinflammatory diseases like TB, T2. DM, SLE. In this focused review, we discuss the latest insights into the role of ATG5 in autoimmunity. Although these studies are at a relatively early stage, ATG5 may eventually come to be regarded as a \"guardian of immune integrity. \" Notably, accumulating evidence indicates that other ATG genes may have similar functions.

The ribosomal clumps in lead poisoning are large because of the inactivation by lead of ribonuclease, which normally breaks down the ribosomes. In addition, a routine Wright-Giemsa stain specifically identifies Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear remnants), malarial pigments, marrow reticulocytes (polychromatic cells or shift cells with a bluish-gray discoloration), and intraerythrocytic parasites (malaria, babesiosis). Special stains are necessary to identify Pappenheimer bodies (hemosiderin requires a Prussian blue stain), reticulocytes (supravital stain detects residual RNA), Heinz bodies (clumps of denatured hemoglobin in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency), and globin chain inclusions (excess a-chains) in severe thalassemia..",

The blood component transfused is not pa of the case definition. Pathogenesis of TRALI The exact pathogenesis of TRALI is not known thus several theories have been proposed. Two basis mechanism have been proposed for the pathogenesis of TRALI for immune competent hosts. * It is hypothesized that TRALI may be precipitated by the infusion of donor antibodies directed against recipient leukocytes. The infusion of donor anti-HLA (human leukocyte antigens) or anti-HNA (human neutrophil antigens) antibodies is thought to directly cause complement activation, resulting in the influx of neutrophils into the lung, followed by neutrophil activation and release of cytotoxic agents, with subsequent endothelial damage and capillary leak. Immediate management of TRALI * Stop the transfusion immediately * Suppo the patient * If the patient is intubated, obtaine undiluted edema fluid as soon as possible(within 15 min) and simultaneous plasma for determination of total protein. * Obtain CBC with DC and chest radiography * Notify the blood bank of possible trali request a different unit and quarantine other unit from the same donor ref: robbins 10th ed",

Tenecteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator produced by recombinant DNA technology using an established mammalian cell line. Tenecteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (t. PA) produced by recombinant DNA technology using an established mammalian cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells). Tenecteplase is a 527 amino acid glycoprotein developed by introducing the following modifications to the complementary DNA (c. DNA) for natural human t. PA: a substitution of threonine 103 with asparagine, and a substitution of asparagine 117 with glutamine, both within the kringle 1 domain, and a tetra-alanine substitution at amino acids 296-299 in the protease domain. Tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-PA by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. It binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus (blood clot) and selectively conves thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus. Tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) compared to native t-PA. pharmacokinetics: Distribution: approximates plasma volume Metabolism: Primarily hepatic Half-life elimination: Biphasic: Initial: 20-24 minutes; Terminal: 90-130 minutes Excretion: Clearance: Plasma: 99-119 mL/minute Ref Robbins 9/e pg 234",

Without the apoprotein, triglyceride and cholesterol cannot be packaged into chylomicrons and VLDL. The disease has its onset in childhood. Malabsorption occurs because dietary fat cannot be packaged into chylomicrons, and intestinal cells fill with lipid. This blocks the reabsorption of fat and other nutrients.

This rare (but often considered diagnostically) tumor is most often found in the adrenal medulla, although it can also be found in other tissues derived from neural crest cells. The tumor cells secrete catecholamine hormones or their precursors, which can cause either paroxysmal (as in this case) or persistent hypertension. Urinary metabolites of epinephrine and norepinephrine are vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid, so screening 24 hour urine collections for these substances can be helpful in establishing or excluding these diagnoses even in cases in which a physician does not observe one of the paroxysms and thus blood cannot be drawn for serum catecholamine levels at that time. DHEA is the adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone (made by the adrenal coex rather than the adrenal medulla), and is measured in serum in cases where adrenal virilism is suspected. h. CG is human chorionic gonadotropin, and both serum and urine levels can increase in pregnancy or trophoblastic disease. 17-ketosteroids are measured in urine during evaluation of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (a disorder of the adrenal coex rather than medulla)..",

Effect of blood volume on mean circulatory filling pressure. The greater the volume of blood in the circulation, the greater is the mean circulatory filling pressure, because extra blood volume stretches the walls of the vasculature. Blood volume of about 4000 milliliters, the mean circulatory filling pressure is close to zero because this is the\"unstressed volume\" of the circulation, but at a volume of 5000 mL the filling pressure is the normal value of 7 mm Hg. Similarly, at still higher volumes, the mean circulatory filling pressure increases almost linearly. Critical Closing Pressure. When pressure falls below a critical level in blood vessels, called the critical closing pressure, blood flow ceases as the blood vessels and completely collapsed.
