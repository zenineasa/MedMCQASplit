They appear as clear, yellow-brown, oval to round, dome-shaped papules that project from the surface of the iris. They are detected by slit lamp examination. These nodules typically do not affect vision, but are very useful in diagnosis. NF-1 is diagnosed if two of following sevens are present:-1) Six or more cafe-au-lait macules: > 5mm in prepubertal age and > 15 mm in postpubertal age. 2) Axillary or inguinal freckling. 3) Two or more Lisch nodules (hamartomas on iris). 4) Two or more neurofibroma or one plexiform neurofibroma. 5) A distinctive osseous lesion: Sphenoid dysplasia or cortical thinning of long bones. 6) Optic glioma. 7) A first degree relative with NF-1.",
