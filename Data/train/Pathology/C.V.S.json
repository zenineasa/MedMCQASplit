        "question": "Amyloidosis causes which type of cardiomyopathy?",
        "exp": "Ans. B. Restrictive. (Ref. Robbins Basic Pathology 8th/ Table 11-5).Restrictive cardiomyopathy results in a stiff, noncompliant myocardium and can be due to depositions (e.g., amyloidosis and hemochromatosis), increased interstitial fibrosis (e.g., caused by irradiation), or to endomyocardial scarring. Myocarditis results from muscle injury caused by an inflammatory process that may be secondary to infections or immune reactions. Coxsackieviruses A and B are the most common causes in the U.S. Clinically, myocarditis may be asymptomatic, give rise to acute heart failure, or evolve into dilated cardiomyopathy.Cardiomyopathy is a term applied to intrinsic disease of the cardiac muscle; there may be specific causes, or it may be idiopathic. There are three general pathophysiologic categories of cardiomyopathy: dilated (90%), hypertrophic, and restrictive (least common). Dilated cardiomyopathy results in systolic (contractile) dysfunction. It may be acquired, for example, following myocarditis, toxic exposures (e.g., alcohol), or pregnancy (peripartum). In 25% to 35% of cases genetic defects in cytoskeletal proteins are causal. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy results in diastolic (relaxation) dysfunction. The vast majority of cases are due to autosomal dominant mutations in the genes encoding the contractile apparatus, in particular ?-myosin heavy chain.

Because of the wall thinning that accompanies dilation, the ventricular thickness may be less than, equal to, or greater than normal. Mural thrombi are common and may be a source of thromboemboli. By definition there is no primary valve pathology. Microscopically most myocytes are hypertrophied with enlarged nuclei, but many are attenuated, stretched, and irregular. There is variable interstitial and endocardial fibrosis.# The essential gross feature of HCM is massive myocardial hypertrophy without ventricular dilation. The classic pattern of HCM involves disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum relative to the left ventricle free wall (so-called asymmetrical septal hypertrophy). On longitudinal sectioning, the ventricular cavity loses its usual round- to-ovoid shape and \"banana-like\" configuration. The characteristic histologic features in HCM are severe myocyte hypertrophy, myocyte (and myofiber) disarray, and interstitial and replacement fibrosis.# In idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy the ventricles are of approximately normal size or slightly enlarged, the cavities are not dilated, and the myocardium is firm. Biatrial dilation is commonly observed. Microscopically there is interstitial fibrosis, varying from minimal and patchy to extensive and diffuse. Restrictive cardiomyopathy of disparate causes may have similar gross morphology. However, endomyocardial biopsy can reveal disease-specific features (e.g., amyloid, iron overload, sarcoid granulomas).",

Rheumatic heart disease is now uncommon, and the number of children that require prophylactic antibiotic therapy to prevent just one case is >10,000. Chronic inflammatory conditions may produce reactive systemic amyloidosis, but this is unlikely to occur given the limited and episodic nature of the streptococcal infection that causes rheumatic heart disease. Fibrinous pericarditis can produce an audible friction rub, but it is not constrictive, and the amount of fluid and fibrin is not great, so no tamponade occurs. Myocardial necrosis associated with myocarditis is patchy, and the ventricle does not rupture to produce tamponade. Fibrosis and fusion of the mitral valve leaflets develop over weeks to months and indicate chronic rheumatic valvulitis.

Barlow's syndrome, Floppy-valve syndrome, and bellowing mitral leaflet syndromeIn MVP, one or both mitral valve leaflets are \"floppy\" and prolapse, or balloon back, into the left atrium during systole.Common in young womenInheritance in familial cases is autosomal dominantQ.Morphology:Characteristic anatomic change in MVP: Interchordal ballooning (hooding) of the mitral leaflets or portions thereof.Affected leaflets are often enlarged, redundant, thick and rubbery.The associated tendinous cords may be elongated, thinned, or even ruptured, and the annulus may be dilated.The tricuspid, aortic, or pulmonary valves may also be affected.Elongated, redundant or ruptured chordae tendinae (patients with ruptured chordae tendinae are usually symptomatic with significant regurgitation - MR)Dysfunction and Ischemia of papillary musclesProgressive dilatation and calcification of mitral valve annulusHistologically, there is attenuation of the collagenous fibrosa layer of the valve, on which the structural integrity of the leaflet depends, accompanied by marked thickening of the spongiosa layer with deposition of mucoid (myxomatous) material.Key histologic change in MVP: Myxomatous degeneration.Clinical Features:Most patients are asymptomaticDiscovered incidentally by detection of a mid-systolic click on physical examination.Associated with a systolic murmurMajority of patients with MVP have no untoward effectsClinical course is usually benignPatients may present with non-specific chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue and palpitationsQAuscultatory findings are characteristic and most importantCharacteristic mid systolicQ or late systolic non ejectionQ clicks which may be multipleQLate systolic ejection murmurQ (Often but not always)Accentuation of findings by Valsalva and standingQDiminished by squatting and isometric exercisesQComplications of MVP (seen in 3% of cases)Infective endocarditisQMitral insufficiencyQ, sometimes with chordal ruptureArrhythmiasQ, both ventricular and atrial.Transient ischemic attackSudden deathQStroke or other systemic infarcts, resulting from embolism of leaflet thrombi.Diagnosis:Diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiographyQ.ECG is normal in most casesQRHD is characterized principally by deforming fibrotic valvular disease, particularly mitral stenosis, of which RHD is virtually the only causeQ.Morphology:During acute RF, focal inflammatory lesions are found in various tissues.Distinctive lesions occur in the heart, called Aschoff bodies, which consist of foci of lymphocytes (primarily T cells), occasional plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cells (pathognomonic for RF).These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round to ovoid nuclei in which the chromatin is disposed in a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation \"caterpillar cells\"), and may become multinucleatedQ.During acute RF, diffuse inflammation and Aschoff bodies may be found in any of the three layers of the heart, causing pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis (pancarditis)Q.Inflammation of the endocardium and the left-sided valves typically results in fibrinoid necrosis within the cusps or along the tendinous cords.Overlying these necrotic foci are small (1-2 mm) vegetations, called verrucae, along the lines of closureQ.Subendocardial lesions, perhaps exacerbated by regurgitant jets, may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques, usually in the left atriumQ.The cardinal anatomic changes of the mitral valve in chronic RHD are leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shortening, and thickening and fusion of the tendinous cordsQ.Fibrous bridging across the valvular commissures and calcification create \"fish mouth''' or \"buttonhole\" stenosesQ.",

Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve results from a defect in connective tissue, whether well-defined or unknown; the mitral valve leaflets are enlarged, hooded, and redundant.

Larger accumulations of calcium in the mitral ring can impinge on the conduction system, however, causing arrhythmias or disrupting the endocardium to provide a focus for infective endocarditis and thrombus formation (which can embolize and cause a stroke, as in this patient). Some cases are associated with mitral valve prolapse. Carcinoid heart disease leads to endocardial and valvular collagenous thickening. Hyperparathyroidism can cause metastatic calcification, which usually does not involve the heart, and deposits would not be so focal; this patient does not have hypercalcemia. Infective endocarditis is a destructive process, and healing may lead to fibrosis, but not to nodular calcium deposition. The most common infiltrative cardiomyopathies are hemochromatosis and amyloidosis. Rheumatic heart disease can lead to scarring with some calcium deposition, but the valve leaflets undergo extensive scarring, with shortening and thickening of the chordae tendineae that preclude upward prolapse. Senile calcific stenosis involves the aortic valve; in this case, there is no evidence of stenosis.",

There is a direct relationship between the degree of troponin elevation and mortality.# However, minor troponin elevations have been reported and can be caused by congestive heart failure, myocarditis, or pulmonary embolism, or they may be false-positive readings. Thus, in patients with an unclear history, small troponin elevations may not be diagnostic of an ACS.In the first 6 hours, ECG is the gold standard. Cardiac troponin I rises after 4 hours and is*for 7-10 days; more specific than other protein markers. CK-MB is predominantly found in myocardium but can also be released from skeletal muscle.Useful in diagnosing reinfarction following acute Ml because levels return to normal after 48 hours.

The most common neoplasm involving the heart is metastatic cancer because primary cardiac neoplasms are rare. The most common primary sites are nearby-lung, breast, and esophagus. The skin lesion in this patient is likely to be a malignant melanoma, which tends to metastasize widely, including to the heart. Most cardiac metastases involve the epicardium/pericardium. (By convention, even though epicardial surfaces are often involved most severely, the term pericardial effusion is typically used when fluid is present, or pericarditis is used when inflammation is present.) A large effusion can cause tamponade, which interferes with cardiac motion. Calcific aortic stenosis leads to left-sided congestive heart failure, with pulmonary edema as a key finding. Coronary atherosclerosis may lead to myocardial infarction, which can be complicated by ventricular rupture and hemopericardium, but the level of troponin I, in this case, suggests that infarction did not occur.
