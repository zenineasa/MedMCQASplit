        "exp": "The clinical and histologic features are consistent with Crohn disease, one of the idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases. Crohn disease is marked by segmental bowel involvement and transmural inflammation that leads to strictures, adhesions, and fistula. Ulcerative colitis has mucosal involvement extending variable distances from the rectum. In contrast to Crohn disease, the mucosal involvement is diffuse and does not show \"skip areas.\" Fissures and fistulas are not frequently seen in ulcerative colitis. The findings in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis overlap, and at least 10% of cases it may be impossible to differentiate between them - so-called indeterminate colitis. Generally, crypt abscesses are more typical of ulcerative colitis, and granulomas are more typical of Crohn disease, but these features are not present in most biopsy specimens from patients with either condition. A story is told of an attending physician at an academic medical center who was known to berate students and residents on rounds for not definitively diagnosing ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. When he retired, incomplete records for patients with idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease were found in his office; the records represented about one-sixth of the total cases of inflammatory bowel disease that he had seen. Amebiasis and shigellosis are infectious processes that can cause mucosal ulceration, but they do not produce granulomas or fissures.

Robbin's, Pathology, 7th/ pg. 815; Harrison 18th/Ch. 151)Essentially all persons colonized with H. pylori develop a host response, which is generally termed chronic gastritis. The nature of the interaction of the host with the particular bacterial population determines the clinical outcome. H. pylori colonization increases the lifetime risk of peptic ulcer disease, noncardia gastric cancer, and B cell non-Hodgkin's gastric lymphoma. In contrast, a growing evidence indicates that H, pylori colonization (especially with cagA+- strains) protects against adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (and the sometimes related gastric cardia) and premalignant lesions such as Barrett's esophagusH. PYLORI# Most infected persons also have the associated gastritis but are asymptomatic.Morphology# H. pylori is a nonsporing, curvilinear gram-negative rod measuring approximately 3.5 x 0.5 mm.# H. pylori is part of a genus of bacteria that have adapted to the ecologic niche provided by gastric mucus.# The specialized traits that allow it to flourish include:- Motility (via flagella), allowing it to swim through viscous mucus- Elaboration of a urease, which produces ammonia and carbon dioxide from endogenous urea, thereby buffering gastric acid in the immediate vicinity of the organism- Expression of bacterial adhesins, such as Bab A, which binds to the fucosylated Lewis B blood-group antigens, enhances binding to blood group O antigen bearing cells.- Expression of bacterial toxins, such as cytotoxin association gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin gene A (VacA).# After initial exposure to H. pylori, gastritis occurs in two patterns:- A predominantly antral-type gastritis with high acid production and elevated risk for duodenal ulcer, and- A pangastritis that is followed by multifocal atrophy (multifocal atrophic gastritis) with lower gastric acid secretion and higher risk for adenocarcinoma.# IL-1b is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine and a powerful gastric acid inhibitor. Patients who have higher IL-1b production in response to H. pylori infection tend to develop pangastritis, while patients who have lower IL-1b production exhibit antral-type gastritis.TRANSMISSION# Oral-oral transmission,# Fecal-oral transmission, and# Environmental spread.Diseases associated with helicobacter pylori in fectionDisease AssociationChronic gastritisStrong causal associationPeptic ulcer diseaseStrong causal associationGastric carcinomaStrong causal associationGastric MALT lymphomaDefinitive etiologic roleDiagnostic Test# Noninvasive tests include a serologic test for antibodies, fecal bacterial detection, and a urea breath test.# Invasive tests are based on the identification of H. pylori in gastric biopsy tissue.# Detection methods in gastric tissue include visualization of the bacteria in histologic sections, bacterial culture, a rapid urease test, and bacterial DNA detection by the polymerase chain reaction.Current Treatment# Patients with chronic gastritis and H. pylori usually improve when treated with antibiotics.# Treatment includes antibiotics and hydrogen pump inhibitors.Tissue Morphology# Gastritis in the setting of environmental etiologies (including infection by H. pylori) tends to affect antral mucosa or both antral and body-fundic mucosa (pangastritis).# Several histologic features are characteristic:- Regenerative Change. In the neck region of the gastric glands mitotic figures are increased.- Metaplasia. The antral, body, and fundic mucosa may become partially replaced by metaplastic columnar absorptive cells and goblet cells of intestinal morphology (intestinal metaplasia)- Atrophy. Atrophy is quite frequently associated with autoimmune gastritis and pangastritis caused by H. pylori. Parietal cells, in particular, may be clearly absent in the autoimmune form.- Dysplasia. Dysplasia is thought to be a precursor lesion of gastric cancer in atrophic forms of gastritis, particularly with pernicious anemia (autoimmune gastritis) and H. pylori-chronic gastritis.",

The infant's length and weight are at the 55th percentile. There is no significant passage of meconium. Three days after birth, the infant vomits all oral feedings. On physical examination, the infant is afebrile, but the abdomen is distended and tender, and bowel sounds are reduced. An abdominal ultrasound scan shows marked colonic dilation above a narrow segment in the distal sigmoid region. A biopsy specimen from the narrowed region shows an absence of ganglion cells in the muscle wall and submucosa. Which of the following is most likely to produce these findings?",
        "exp": "In Hirschsprung disease, seen in 1 in 5000 live births, the aganglionic segment (either a short or long segment) of the bowel wall produces a functional obstruction with proximal distention. Most familial cases and some sporadic cases have RET gene mutations affecting neural crest cell migration. Atresia is congenitally narrowed segments of the bowel (usually the small intestine) that occur with other anomalies. Patients with trisomy 21 may have intestinal (usually duodenal) atresia. The complete absence of the colonic lumen at a point of atresia is a rare congenital anomaly and is not associated with the loss of ganglion cells. Intussusception also is a cause of bowel obstruction in infants, but it is not caused by an aganglionic segment of bowel. Necrotizing enterocolitis is a complication of prematurity. A volvulus is a form of mechanical obstruction that occurs from the twisting of the small bowel on the mesentery or twisting of a segment of the colon (sigmoid or cecal regions).",

These may also be seen in mesenteric lymph nodes.oCutaneous granuloma as form nodules are known as metastatic Crohn's disease.oAbsence of granulomas does not preclude a diagnosis of Crohn's disease.oTransmural involvement is characteristic feature of Crohn's diseaseoSkip lesions is characteristic of Crohn's disease & may help in differentiating from ulcerative colitis.Other Options[?]Ulcerative ColitisoGrossly, ulcerative colitis always involves the rectum and extends proximally in a continuous fashion to involve part or all of the colon.oDisease of the entire colon is termed pancolitis, while left-sided disease extends no farther than the transverse colon. Limited distal disease may be referred to descriptively as ulcerative proctitis or ulcerative proctosigmoiditis.oSmall intestine is normal, although mild mucosal inflammation of the distal ileum, termed backwash ileitis, may be present in severe cases of pancolitis.oSkip lesions are not seen (although focal appendiceal or cecal inflammation may occasionally be present in left-sided ulcerative colitis).oGrossly, involved colonic mucosa may be slightly red and granular or have extensive, broad-based ulcers.oThere can be an abrupt transition between diseased and uninvolved colon.oUlcers are aligned along the long axis of the colon but do not typically replicate the serpentine ulcers of Crohn disease. Isolated islands of regenerating mucosa often bulge into the lumen to create pseudopolyps & the tips of these polyps may fuse to create mucosal bridges. Chronic disease may lead to mucosal atrophy with a flat and smooth mucosal surface that lacks normal folds.oUnlike Crohn disease, mural thickening is not present, the serosal surface is normal, and strictures do not occur. However, inflammation and inflammatory mediators can damage the muscularis propria and disturb neuromuscular function leading to colonic dilation and toxic megacolon, which carries a significant risk of perforation,oSubmucosal fibrosis, mucosal atrophy, and distorted mucosal architecture remain as residua of healed disease but histology may also revert to near normal after prolonged remission.oGranulomas are not present in ulcerative colitis.

In includes mutation ofAPC early in the neoplastic process. APC protein normally binds to and promotes the degradation of b-catenin. When both copies of the APC gene are inactivate by mutation, loss of APC function results in b-catenin accumulation.# b-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it inactivates the transcription of genes, such as those encoding MYC and Cyclin D1, which promote proliferation. This is followed by additional mutation in K-RASy which also promote proliferation.# Neoplastic progression is also associated with mutation in other tumour suppressur genes such as those encoding SMAD2 and SMAD4, which are effectors of TGF-b signaling. The tumor suppressor p53 is mutated in 70-80% of colon cancers.# Expression of telomerase is also increased as lesions become more advanced.2) Microstatellite instability pathway (DNA mismatch repair deficiency)# Mutations accumulate in microsatellite repeat, a conditions referred to as microsatellite instability.
