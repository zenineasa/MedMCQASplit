        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Reticulocytosis REF: Harrison's 18th ed ch: 103. Monitoring iron therapy: Clinically, the effectiveness of iron therapy is best evaluated by tracking the reticulocyte response and the rise in the hemoglobin or the hematocrit. An increase in the reticulocyte count is not observed for at least 4 to 7 days after beginning therapy. A measurable increase in the hemoglobin level takes even longer. A decision as to the effectiveness of treatment should not be made for 3 to 4 weeks after the start of treatment. An increase of 20 g per liter or more in the concentration of hemoglobin by that time should be considered a positive response, assuming that no other change in the patient s clinical status can account for the improvement and that the patient has not been transfused. A few important points about oral iron therapy: According to good man gillman the oral drug of choice for iron deficiency anemia is ferrous sulfate. Remember ferrous sulfate contains 32% elemental iron and ferrous fumarate contains 33% elemental ironiron usually is absorbed in the upper small intestine. Typically, for iron replacement therapy, up to 300 mg of elemental iron per day is given, usually as three or four iron tablets (each containing 50-65 mg elemental iron) given over the course of the day. Ideally, oral iron preparations should be taken on an empty stomach, since food may inhibit iron absorption. The goal of therapy in individuals with iron-deficiency anemia is not only to repair the anemia, but also to provide stores of at least 0. 5-1 g of iron. Sustained treatment for a period of 6-12 months after correction of the anemia will be necessary to achieve this. Of the complications of oral iron therapy, gastrointestinal distress is the most prominent and is seen in 15-20% of patients",

Adult males have serum ferritin levels that average -100 mg./L, corresponding to iron stores of-1 g. Adult females have lower serum ferritin levels averaging 30 mg/L, reflecting lower iron stores (-300 mg). o A serum ferritin level of 10-15 mg/L represents depletion of body iron stores. However, ferritin is also an acute- phase reactant and, in the presence of acute or chronic inflammation, may rise several-fold above baseline levels. As a rule, a serum ferritin 200 pg/L means there is at least some iron in tissue stores.",

Robbings pathology 9th ed. /650* Ferritin is the storage and transferring the transport form of iron.* Hepcidin is released by liver in setting of anemia of chronic disease. Ferroportin is a transmembrane protein that transports iron from the inside of a cell to the outside of it. Ferroportin-1 plays an important role in neural tube closure and forebrain patterning.* REMEMBER: Ferroportein is inhibited by hepcidin, which binds to ferroportin and internalises it within the cell. This results in the retention of iron within cells, and a reduction in iron levels within the plasma. This is especially significant in enterocytes which are shed at the end of their lifespan where ferroportein is expressed on the basolateral membranes. The extra iron retained within them is not only prevented from entering the bloodstream but ends up being excreted into the faeces. Hepcidin is thus the \"master regulator\" of human iron metabolism.* In the setting of anemia, low serum ferritin is the most specific lab test for iron deficiency anemia. However it is less sensitive, since its levels are increased in the blood by infection or any type of chronic inflammation, and these conditions may convert what would otherwise be a low level of ferritin from lack of iron, into a value in the normal range. For this reason, low ferritin levels carry more information than those in the normal range. Low ferritin may also indicate hypothyroidism, vitamin C deficiency or celiac disease.",
