        "exp": "Ans. d. Codominance (Ref Robbins 9/e p140; Ganong 23/e p527). Inheritance of ABO blood group is Codominance. \"Although Mendelian traits are usually described as dominant or recessive, in some cases both of the alleles of a gene pair contribute to the phenotype--a condition called codominance. Histocompatibility and blood group antigens are good examples of codominant inheritance. \"--Robbins 9/e p140. Codominance is a relationship between two versions of a gene, individuals receive one version of a gene, called an allele, from each parent. If the alleles are different, the dominant allele usually will be expressed, while the effect of the other allele, called recessive, is masked. In Codominance, however, neither allele is recessive nor are the phenotypes of both alleles are expressed, e. g., ABO blood group, where in AB blood group both A and B are dominant. \"Codominance: When both alleles of a gene pair contribute to the phenotype. E. g., Blood group AB. ABO Blood Group SystemA and B antigens of the ABO blood group system are glycoproteins present on the RBC membrane. H substance is the immediate precursor on which A and B antigens are added. H substance is formed by the addition of fucose to the glycolipid or glycoprotein backbone. The subsequent N-acetyl glucosamine creates the A antigen, while the addition of galactose produces the B antigen. Bombay phenotype. Individuals with the rare Bombay phenotype (hh) do not express the H antigen (also called the H substance), the antigen, which is present in blood group OQ. As a result of the absence of the H antigen they cannot make either the A antigen or the B antigenQ. These individuals have antibodies not only against A and B antigens but also against the H antigenQ.",

Mitochondrial inheritance. \"In 20% to 50% of cases, DCM is familial and caused by inherited genetic abnormalities. In the genetic forms of DCM, autosomal- dominant inheritance is the predominant pattern; X-linked, autosomal-recessive, and mitochondrial inheritance are less common. The genetic abnormalities identified as causes of familial DCM in humans most commonly affect genes that encode cytoskeietal proteins expressed by myocyte. \" Ref: Robbins\"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), or arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease of the cardiac muscle that causes right ventricular failure and various rhythm disturbances, particularly ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation that can lead to sudden death. primarily in young people Left-sided involvement with left-sided heart failure may also occur Morphologically, the right ventricular wall. is severely thinned because of loss of myocytes, with extensive fatty infiltration and fibrosis. The condition appears to have autosomal- dominant inheritance and variable penetrance The disease seems to be related to defective cell adhesion proteins in the desmosomes that link adjacent cardiac myocytes. \" Ref: Robbins\"HOCM is caused by mutations in any one of several genes that encode sarcomeric proteins. In most cases the pattern of transmission is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance Remaining cases seem to be sporadic. More than 400 different mutations have been found in nine different genes in HCM, most being missense mutations. Mutations causing HOCM are found most commonly in the gene encoding b-myosin heavy chain (b-MHC), with the genes for cardiac TnT, a-tropomyosin. and myosin-binding protein C (MYBP- C) being the next most frequently mutated. Mutations in b-MHC, MYBP- C, and TnT account for 70% to 80% of all cases of HOCM. \" Ref: Robbins\"The basis for the changes that weaken the valve leaflets and associated structures is unknown in most cases.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., 46, XY o Presence of abdominal or inguinal testis suggests testicular feminisation syndrome. o The characteristic features of these disorders are that they are genotypically male (AT) while phenotypically they are female. o These cases usually present as female with abdominal testis. Prepubertal children with this disorder are often detected when inguinal masses prove to be a testis or when a testis is unexpectedly found during herniorrhapy in phenotypically female. o It is called testicular feminisation syndrome but the name is both stigmatising and inaccurate (the testes do not produce feminising factors). o The preferred name, complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) reflects the underlying aetiology, o The cause of androgen insensitivity svndrome is the abnormality of the androgen receptor. o In the fetus with CAIS testes forms normally due to the presence of the (SRY gene) on chromosome Y. o At the appropriate time, these testes secretes anti Mullerian hormone leading to the regression of mullerian ducts. Hence CAIS 'women ' do not have a uterus. o Testosterone is also produced at the appropriate time. However due to the complete inability of the androgen receptor to respond, the external genitalia do not virilise and instead undergo female development. o These patients have vagina instead of penis. o Other areas where testosterone may have important fetal effects, such as \\hc brain, will also develop along the female path, o The result is a female (both physically and psychologically) with no uterus, testis present which is found at some point in their line of descent through the abdomen from the pelvis to the inguinal canal. o During puberty, breast development will be normal: however, the effects of androgens will not be seen, so pubic and axillary hair growth will be minimal. o Majority of women with CAIS have shortened vagina, when compared with normal average length of 10-12 cm. o The cause of this lies in the embroyological development of the vagina, * Upper portion of vagina-develops from mullerian ducts* Lower portion of vagina-develops from urogenital sinus. o In CAIS mullerian duct regresses, under the effect of mullerian inhibiting hormone, leaving just the part derived from the urogenital sinus.

        "question": "Classic example of missense mutation -",
        "exp": "Ans. is i. e., Sickle cell disease. In sickle cell anemia there is missense type of point mutation. Mutationso A mutation is a permanent change in the DNA. o Mutations that affect germ cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease. o Mutations that affect somatic cells are not transmitted to progeny but are important in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations. o Mutations may be classified into three categories -1. Gene mutationso The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations. o These may of different types depending w'hether it involves complete gene or single base -(a) Point mutationo A single nucleotide base is substituted by a different base. o When a pyrimidine base is substituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine - Transition. o When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa - Transversion. o This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i. e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product. o Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation. o Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in [3-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine. o Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon. o Example is [3-thalassemia in which CAG codon in p-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation. Deletion and insertionso Deletion or insertion of one or two base lead to alterations in the readi ng frame of the DNA strand - frame shift mutation. o If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three ffamshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized. Trinucleotide repeat mutationo Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide. o In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain, o For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG. Chromosome mutationo Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome..

It is an X-linked recessive disorder. It is caused by a mutation in gene responsible for producing dystrophin (a sarcolemmal protein). o The usual age of onset is 3-5 years (does not present at birth or infancy), i. e., disease begin to manifest when child starts walking. o There is progressive muscle weakness affecting proximal muscles of limbs. Child walks clumsily, has difficulty in climbing stairs and the gait is waddling (Trendelenburg). Because of weakness of proximal (thigh) muscles, there is compensatory hypertrophy of distal (calf) muscles. This is called pseudohypertrophy because it is not true hypertrophy of muscles, instead the muscle is replaced by fat and connective tissue. Extraocular muscles are spared. o Other features are scoliosis, epilepsy and mild mental retardation. Patient die in the second decade of life because of respiratory failure and cardiomy opathy. Gower sign is positive, i. e. the child uses hand support to stand from sitting position because of proximal weakenss. o Serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels are elevated many folds. Histopathology demonstrates diffuse degeneration and muscle fibres of varying size. o Becker's muscular dystrophy is a milder version of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in which dystrophin is not completely absent.

(Gonadal dysgensis)o Short stature in Turner *s syndrome is also attributed to the loss ofhomeobox (SHOX) gene. o Homeobox gene is present on both the X chromosomes and is responsible for skeletal development. o Loss of this gene in Turner's syndrome results in short stature, o Congenital cardiac defects occur in Turner's syndrome. o Turner's syndrome results from complete or partial monosomy of the X chromosome and is characterized primarily by hypogonadism in phenotypic females. o It is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in females. Features of Turner syndrome in childreno The most severely affected patients generally present during infancy writh edema (owing to lymph stasis) of the dorsum of the hand and foot and sometimes swelling of the nape of the neck. o Swelling of the neck is related to markedly distended ly mphatic channels, producing so called cystic hygroma. o As these infants develop, the swelling subsides but often leave bilateral neck webbing and persistent looseness of skin on the back of the neck. o Congenital heart disease is also common, particularly preductal coarctation of Aorta and bicuspid Aortic valve, o C. V. S abnormalities are most important cause of mortality in children with Turner s syndrome. Features of Turner's syndrome in Adolescents and Adulto At puberty there is failure to develop normal secondary sex characteristics. o The genitalia remains infantile, breast development is inadequate and there is little pubic hair. Nipples are widely- spaced. o Turner syndrome is the single most important cause of primary- amenarrhoea accounting for approximately 1/3 of the cases. a Short stature (height rarely exceeds 150 cm). o The mental status of these patients is usually normal but subtle defects in nonverbal, visual spatial information processing have been noted (Recall that mental retardation is associated with the presence of extra chromosome) not with loss of X chromosome. o About 50% of the patients develop autoantibodies directed to the thyroid gland and upto one half of these patients develop hypothyroidism. o Glucose intolerance, obesity and insulin resistance are also seen.",

Microfibrils (containing fibrillin) are mainly distributed to Aorta, ligaments of joint and ciliary zolules of lens - So, in marfan syndrome these tissues are primarily affected.",
