DIC is caused by the systemic activation of coagulation and results in the for- mation of thrombi throughout the microcirculation. As a conse- quence, platelets and coagulation factors are consumed and, secondarily, fibrinolysis is activated. Thus, DIC can give rise to either tissue hypoxia and microinfarcts caused by myriad microthrombi or to a bleeding disorder related to patho- logic activation of fibrinolysis and the depletion of the ele- ments required for hemostasis (hence the term consumptive coagulopathy). This entity probably causes bleeding more commonly than all of the congenital coagulation disorders combined. 2)nutritional deficiency: B12 and folate deficiency. 3) Bone marrow failure: aplastic anemia 4) Bone marrow replacement: Leukemia, disseminated cancer 5).

Ceain morphologic features are common to all forms of megaloblastic anemia. The bone marrow is markedly hyper- cellular and contains numerous megaloblastic erythroid pro- genitors. Megaloblasts are larger than normal erythroid progenitors (normoblasts) and have delicate, finely reticu- lated nuclear chromatin (indicative of nuclear immaturity) (Fig. 11-11). As megaloblasts differentiate and acquire hemo- globin, the nucleus retains its finely distributed chromatin and fails to undergo the chromatin clumping typical of normo- blasts. The granulocytic precursors also demonstrate nuclear- cytoplasmic asynchrony, yielding giant metamyelocytes. Megakaryocytes may also be abnormally large and have bizarre multilobed nuclei. In the peripheral blood the earliest change is the appear- ance of hypersegmented neutrophils, which appear before the onset of anemia. Normal neutrophils have three or four nuclear lobes, but in megaloblastic anemias they often have five or more. The red cells typically include large, egg- shaped macro-ovalocytes; the mean cell volume often is greater than 110 fL (normal, 82 to 92 fL). Although macro- cytes appear hyperchromic, in reality the mean cell hemoglo- bin concentration is normal. Large, misshapen platelets also may be seen. Morphologic changes in other systems, espe- cially the gastrointestinal tract, also occur, giving rise to some of the clinical manifestations.

        "exp": "Hemoglobin S (Hb S) is formed by the replacement of glutamic acid by valine in the sixth position in the b chain of hemoglobin. On deoxygenation, Hb S polymerizes and the red cells sickle. In patients heterozygous for Hb S (sickle cell trait, Hb AS), there is approximately 45% Hb S and 55% Hb A. Because of the content of Hb A, erythrocytes only sickle at low oxygen tension and symptoms are much milder than in sickle cell disease. Hb F does not react with hemoglobin S, so that patients who have Hb S and large amounts of Hb F, as occurs in newborns with sickle cell disease, are asymptomatic. Clinically, sickle cell disease is characterized by the triad of chronic hemolytic anemia, vascular occlusion, and vulnerability to infection. The severe chronic hemolytic anemia leads to chronic hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), which leads to pigmented gallstones. Vascular occlusion results in leg ulcers, renal papillary necrosis, and multiple infarcts, which may cause severe bone pain. Repeated splenic infarcts cause progressive fibrosis and splenic atrophy (autoinfarction). Rather than hypersplenism, most adults have a small, functionless, fibrotic spleen. The lack of splenic function along with defects in the alternate complement pathway predispose to infections such as Salmonella osteomyelitis and pneumococcal infections. The vasoocclusive disease also leads to painful crises, hand-foot syndrome in children (consisting of the typical triad of fever, pallor, and symmetric swelling of hands and feet), and infarctive crises. In patients not having yet undergone splenic autoinfarction (usually children), massive splenic sequestration (sequestration crisis) may lead to rapid splenic enlargement, hypovolemia, and shock. Patients with sickle cell disease have a normocytic anemia with a corrected reticulocyte count of greater than 3%. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is zero because the sickled red cells cannot aggregate and settle in the test tube. Hydroxyurea has recently been approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease because it increases the synthesis of hemoglobin F, thus reducing the severity of the disease Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",

        "exp": "Examination of the peripheral blood reveals erythrocytes with a membrane defect forming \"bite\" cells; when crystal violet stain is applied, many Heinz bodies are seen. Glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6. PD) is an enzyme of the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway that maintains glutathione in a reduced (active) form. Glutathione normally protects hemoglobin from oxidative injury. If the erythrocytes are deficient in G6. PD, as occurs in G6. PD deficiency, exposure to oxidant drugs, such as the antimalarial drug primaquine, denatures hemoglobin, which then precipitates with erythrocytes as Heinz bodies. Macrophages within the spleen remove these bodies, producing characteristic \"bite\" cells. These red cells then become less deformable and are trapped and destroyed within the spleen (extravascular hemolysis). The gene for G6. PD is located on the X chromosome and has considerable pleomorphism at this site. Two variants are the A type, which is found in 10% of African Americans and is characterized by milder hemolysis of younger red cells, and the Mediterranean type, which is characterized by a more severe hemolysis of red cells of all ages. Hereditary spherocytosis (HS), an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by an abnormality of the skeleton of the red cell membrane that makes the erythrocyte spherical, less deformable, and vulnerable to splenic sequestration and destruction (extravascular hemolysis). In HS, there is a defect in the spectrin molecule, which then is less binding to protein 4. 1. This disorder can be diagnosed in the laboratory by the osmotic fragility test. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), an acquired clonal stem cell disorder, is characterized by abnormal red cells, granulocytes, and platelets. The red cells are abnormally sensitive to the lytic activity of complement due to a deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) linked proteins, namely decay-accelerating factor (DAF, or CD55), membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (CD59), or CD59 (a C8 binding protein). omplement is activated by acidosis, such as with exercise or sleep, which can produce red morning urine. Complications of PNH include the development of frequent thromboses and possibly acute leukemia. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia refers to hemolysis of red cells caused by narrowing within the microvasculature and is seen in patients with prosthetic hea valves or those with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, or hemolytic-uremic syndrome Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",

This blood test is also called protime INRand PT/INR. They are used to determine the clotting tendency of blood, in the measure of warfarindosage, liver damage, and vitamin K status. PT measures the following coagulation factors: I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V (proaccelerin), VII (proconvein), and X (Stua-Prower factor). The reference range for prothrombin time depends on the analytical method used, but is usually around 12-13 seconds (results should always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that performed the test), and the INR in absence of anticoagulation therapy is 0. 8-1. 2.

        "question": "Mutation of which of the following gene is most impoant in paroxysmal nocturnal hemaglobinuria-",
        "exp": "in PNH, these GPI(Glycosyl Phosphatidyl Inositol) -linked proteins are deficient because of somatic mutations that inactivate PIGA. PIGA is X linked and subject to lyonisation. PNH stems from acquired mutations in gene PIGA, which is required for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG), a membrane anchor that is a component of many proteins. Without the \"PIG-tail, \" these proteins cannot be expressed on the cell surface. The affected proteins include several that limit the activation of complement. As a result, PIGA-deficient precursors give rise to red cells that are inordinately sensitive to complement-mediated lysis. Leukocytes are also deficient in these protective pro- teins, but nucleated cells are generally less sensitive to com- plement than are red cells, and as a result the red cells take the brunt of the attack. The paroxysmal nocturnal hemolysis that gives the disorder its name occurs because the fixation of complement is enhanced by the slight decrease in blood pH that accompanies sleep (owing to CO2 retention). However, most patients present less dramatically with anemia due to chronic low-level hemolysis. Another complication that is often serious and sometimes fatal is venous throm- bosis. The etiopathogenesis of the prothrombotic state is somehow also related to the activity of the complement membrane attack complex, as inhibitors of this complex (described below) greatly lessen the incidence of thrombosis. Because PIGA is X-linked, normal cells have only a single active PIGA gene, mutation of which is sufficient to give rise to PIGA deficiency. Because all myeloid lineages are affected in PNH, the responsible mutations must occur in an early myeloid progenitor with self-renewal capacity. Remarkably, many normal individuals harbor small numbers of bone marrow cells bearing PIGA mutations identical to those that cause PNH. It is believed that clinically evident PNH occurs only in rare instances in which the PIGA mutant clone has a survival advantage. One setting in which this may be true is in primary bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia), which most often appears to be caused by immune-mediated destruction or suppression of marrow stem cells. It is hypoth- esized that PIGA-deficient stem cells somehow escape the immune attack and eventually replace the normal marrow elements. Targeted therapy with an antibody that inhibits the C5b-C9 membrane attack complex is effective at diminishing both the hemolysis and the thrombotic complications, but also places patients at high risk for Neisseria infections, includ- ing meningococcal sepsis.

Sickle cell hemoglobin is HbS. some are heterozygous for HbS called as sickle cell trait. In them only about half of HbA is replaced by HbS. Parasite densities(falciparum malaria) are relatively lower in heterozygous due to 1-Metabolically active intracellular parasites consume oxygen and decrease intracellular pH, both of which promote Hb sickling in AS red cells. These distoed and stiffened cells may be cleared more rapidly by phagocytes in spleen and liver helping to keep parasite load down. 2-Sickling impairs the formation of membrane knobs containing a protein made by the parasite called Pf. EMP-1. These membrane knobs are implicated in adhesion of infected red cells to endothelium which is believed to have an impoant pathogenic role in the most severe form of the disease cerebral malaria.

        "exp": "TEXTBOOK OF PATHOLOGY HARSHMOHAN 6. TH EDITION PG NO 332&333 THROMBOCYTOPENIAS Thrombocytopenia is defined as a reduction in the peripheral blood platelet count below the lower limit of normal i. e. below 150, 000/ml. Thrombocytopenia is associated with abnormal bleeding that includes spontaneous skin purpura and mucosal haemorrhages as well as prolonged bleeding after trauma. However, spontaneous haemorrhagic tendency becomes clinically evident only after severe depletion of the platelet count to level below 20, 000/ml. SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues Thrombocytopenia may result from 4 main groups of causes: 1. Impaired platelet production. 2. Accelerated platelet destruction. 3. Splenic sequestration. 4. Dilutional loss. A list of causes of thrombocytopenia is given in Table 13. 2. Three of the common and impoant causes-- drug-induced thrombocytopenia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), are discussed below. Drug-induced Thrombocytopenia Many commonly used drugs cause thrombocytopenia by depressing megakaryocyte production. In most cases, an immune mechanism by formation of drug-antibody complexes is implicated in which the platelet is damaged as an 'innocent bystander'. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is associated with many commonly used drugs and includes: chemotherapeutic agents (alkylating agents, anthracyclines, TABLE 13. 2: Causes of Thrombocytopenia. I. II. IMPAIRED PLATELET PRODUCTION 1. Generalised bone marrow failure e. g. Aplastic anemia, leukaemia, myelofibrosis, megaloblastic anemia, marrow infiltrations (carcinomas, lymphomas, multiple myeloma, storage diseases). 2. Selective suppression of platelet production e. g. Drugs (quinine, quinidine, sulfonamides, PAS, rifampicin, anticancer drugs, thiazide diuretics), (heparin, diclofenac, acyclovir), alcohol intake. ACCELERATED PLATELET DESTRUCTION 1. Immunologic thrombocytopenias e. g. ITP (acute and chronic), neonatal and post-transfusion (isoimmune), drug-induced, secondary immune 'thrombocytopenia (post-infection, SLE, AIDS, CLL, lymphoma). 2. Increased consumption e. g. DIC, TTP, giant haemangiomas, microangiopathic haemolytic anemia. III. SPLENIC SEQUESTRATION Splenomegaly IV. DILUTIONAL LOSS Massive transfusion of old stored blood to bleeding patients. antimetabolites), ceain antibiotics (sulfonamides, PAS, rifampicin, penicillins), drugs used in cardiovascular diseases (digitoxin, thiazide diuretics), diclofenac, acyclovir, heparin and excessive consumption of ethanol. Clinically, the patient presents with acute purpura. The platelet count is markedly lowered, often below 10, 000/ml and the bone marrow shows normal or increased number of megakaryocytes. The immediate treatment is to stop or replace the suspected drug with instruction to the patient to avoid taking the offending drug in future. Occasional patients may require temporary suppo with glucocoicoids, plasmapheresis or platelet transfusions. Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia due to administration of heparin is distinct from that caused by other drugs in following ways: i) Thrombocytopenia is generally not so severe to fall to level below 20, 000/ml. ii) Unlike drug-induced thrombocytopenia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is not associated with bleeding but instead these patients are more prone to develop thrombosis. The underlying mechanism of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is formation of antibody against platelet factor 4 (PF-4)-heparin complex. This specific antibody activates the endothelial cells and initiates thrombus formation. It occurs in a small propoion of cases after the patient has received heparin for 5-10 days. Diagnosis is made by a combination of laboratory and clinical features with 4 Ts: thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, time of fall of platelet count, absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia. Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), is characterised by immunologic destruction of platelets and normal or increased megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. PATHOGENESIS. On the basis of duration of illness, ITP is classified into acute and chronic forms, both of which have different pathogenesis. Acute ITP. This is a self-limited disorder, seen most frequently in children following recovery from a viral illness (e. g. hepatitis C, infectious mononucleosis, CMV infection, HIV infection) or an upper respiratory illness. The onset of acute ITP is sudden and severe thrombocytopenia but recovery occurs within a few weeks to 6 months. The mechanism of acute ITP is by formation of immune complexes containing viral antigens, and by formation of antibodies against viral antigens which crossreact with platelets and lead to their immunologic destruction. Chronic ITP. Chronic ITP occurs more commonly in adults, paicularly in women of child-bearing age (20-40 years). The disorder develops insidiously and persists for several years. Though chronic ITP is idiopathic, similar immunologic thrombocytopenia may be seen in association with SLE, AIDS and autoimmune thyroiditis. The pathogenesis of chronic ITPis explained by formation of anti-platelet autoantibodies, usually by platelet-associated IgG humoral antibodies synthesised mainly in the spleen. These antibodies are directed against target antigens on the platelet glycoproteins, Gp IIb-IIIa and Gp Ib-IX complex. Some of the antibodies directed against platelet surface also interfere in their function. The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar to that seen in autoimmune haemolytic anemias. Sensitised platelets are destroyed mainly in the spleen and rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by cells of the reticuloendothelial system.<\\p>",

        "question": "Invovled in Hereditiary spherocytosis -",
        "exp": "the pathogenic mutations of HS affect ankyrin, band3, spectrin, or band 4. 2. Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by abnormalities in the membrane skeleton, a network of proteins that underlies lipid bilayer of the red cell (Fig. 11-1). The major membrane skeleton protein is spectrin, a long, flexible het- erodimer that self-associates at one end and binds sho actin filaments at its other end. These contacts create a two- dimensional meshwork that is linked to the overlying mem- brane through ankyrin and band 4. 2 to the intrinsic membrane protein called band 3, and through band 4. 1 to glycophorin. The mutations in hereditary spherocytosis most frequently involve ankyrin, band 3, and spectrin, but mutations in other components of the skeleton have also been described. A shared feature of the pathogenic mutations is that they weaken the veical interactions between the membrane skeleton and the intrinsic membrane proteins. This defect somehow destabilizes the lipid bilayer of the red cells, which shed membrane vesicles into the cir- culation as they age. Little cytoplasm is lost in the process and as a result the surface area to volume ratio decreases progressively over time until the cells become spherical (Fig. 11-1). The spleen plays a major role in the destruction of sphe- rocytes. Red cells must undergo extreme degrees of defor- mation to pass through the splenic cords. The floppy discoid shape of normal red cells allows considerable latitude for shape changes. By contrast, spherocytes have limited deform- ability and are sequestered in the splenic cords, where they are destroyed by the plentiful resident macrophages. The critical role of the spleen is illustrated by the beneficial effect of splenectomy; although the red cell defect and spherocytes persist, the anemia is corrected. Ref: Robbins 9/, e pg: 633",

        "question": "Which of the following is most common hemoglobinopathy",
        "exp": "On deoxygenation, HbS molecules form long polymers by means of intermolecular contacts that involve the abnormal valine residue at position 6. These polymers disto the red cell, which assumes an elongated crescentic, or sickle, shape (Fig. 11-3). The sickling of red cells initially is reversible upon reoxygenation. However, the distoion of the membrane that is produced by each sickling episode leads to an influx of calcium, which causes the loss of potassium and water and also damages the membrane skeleton. Over time, this cumu- lative damage creates irreversibly sickled cells, which are rapidly hemolyzed. Many variables influence the sickling of red cells in vivo. The three most impoant factors are * The presence of hemoglobins other than HbS. In heterozygotes approximately 40% of Hb is HbS and the remainder is HbA, which interacts only weakly with deox- ygenated HbS. Because the presence of HbA greatly retards the polymerization of HbS, the red cells of het- erozygotes have little tendency to sickle in vivo. Such persons are said to have sickle cell trait. HbC, another mutant b-globin, has a lysine residue instead of the normal glutamic acid residue at position 6. About 2. 3% of Ameri- can blacks are heterozygous carriers of HbC; as a result, about 1 in 1250 newborns are compound heterozygotes for HbC and HbS. Because HbC has a greater tendency to aggregate with HbS than does HbA, HbS/HbC com- pound heterozygotes have a symptomatic sickling disorder called Hb. SC disease. HbF interacts weakly with HbS, so newborns with sickle cell anemia do not manifest the disease until HbF falls to adult levels, generally around the age of 5 to 6 months. * The intracellular concentration of HbS. The polyA merization of deoxygenated HbS is strongly concentration- dependent. Thus, red cell dehydration, which increases the Hb concentration, facilitates sickling. Conversely, the coexistence of a-thalassemia (described later), which decreases the Hb concentration, reduces sickling. The relatively low concentration of HbS also contributes to the absence of sickling in heterozygotes with sickle cell trait. * The transit time for red cells through the micro- vasculature. The normal transit times of red cells through capillaries are too sho for significant polymeriza- tion of deoxygenated HbS to occur. Hence, sickling in microvascular beds is confined to areas of the body in which blood flow is sluggish. This is the normal situation in the spleen and the bone marrow, two tissues promi- nently affected by sickle cell disease. Sickling also can be triggered in other microvascular beds by acquired factors that retard the passage of red cells. As described previ- ously, inflammation slows the flow of blood by increasing the adhesion of leukocytes and red cells to endothelium and by inducing the exudation of fluid through leaky vessels. In addition, sickle red cells have a greater tendency than normal red cells to adhere to endothelial cells, appar- ently because repeated bouts of sickling causes mem- brane damage that make them sticky. These factors conspire to prolong the transit times of sickle red cells, increasing the probability of clinically significant sickling. Two major consequences arise from the sickling of red cells (Fig. 11-4). First, the red cell membrane damage and dehydration caused by repeated episodes of sickling produce a chronic hemolytic anemia. The mean life span of red cells in sickle cell anemia is only 20 days (one sixth of normal). Second, red cell sickling produces widespread microvascular obstructions, which result in ischemic tissue damage and pain crises. Vaso-occlusion does not cor- relate with the number of irreversibly sickled cells and there- fore appears to result from factors such as infection, inflammation, dehydration, and acidosis that enhance the sickling of reversibly sickled cells.

WF. von Willebrand Disease von Willebrand disease is transmitted as an autosomal dominant disorder. It usually presents as spontaneous bleed- ing from mucous membranes, excessive bleeding from wounds, and menorrhagia. It is underrecognized, as the diagnosis requires sophisticated tests and the clinical manifestations often are quite mild. Actually, this disease is surprisingly prevalent, paicularly in persons of European descent. It is estimated that approximately 1% of people in the United States have von Willebrand disease, making it the most common inher- ited bleeding disorder. People with von Willebrand disease have compound defects in platelet function and coagulation, but in most cases only the platelet defect produces clinical findings. The exceptions are rare patients with homozygous von Willebrand disease, in whom there is a concomitant defi- ciency of factor VIII severe enough to produce features resembling those of hemophilia (described later on). The classic and most common variant of von Willebrand disease (type I) is an autosomal dominant disorder in which the quantity of circulating v. WF is reduced. There is also a measur- able but clinically insignificant decrease in factor VIII levels. The other, less common varieties of von Willebrand disease are caused by mutations that produce both qualita- tive and quantitative defects in v. WF. Type II is divided into several subtypes characterized by the selective loss of high- molecular-weight multimers of v. WF. Because these large mul- timers are the most active form, there is a functional deficiency of v. WF. In type IIA, the high-molecular-weight multimers are not synthesized, leading to a true deficiency. In type IIB, abnormal \"hyperfunctional\" high-molecular- weight multimers are synthesized that are rapidly removed from the circulation. These high-molecular-weight multiA mers cause spontaneous platelet aggregation (a situation reminiscent of the very-high-molecular-weight multimer aggregates seen in TTP); indeed, some people with type IIB von Willebrand disease have mild chronic thrombocytope- nia, presumably due to platelet consumption.

In this stage, liver cells are filled with multiple fat droplets that do not displace the centrally located nucleus. In the late stages, the size of the vacuoles increases, pushing the nucleus to the periphery of the cell, giving characteristic signet ring appearance (macrovesicular fatty change). These vesicles are well-delineated and optically \"empty\" because fats dissolve during tissue processing. Large vacuoles may coalesce and produce fatty cysts, which are irreversible lesions. Macrovesicular steatosis is the most common form and is typically associated with alcohol, diabetes, obesity, and coicosteroids. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy and Reye's syndrome are examples of severe liver disease caused by microvesicular fatty change.

        "question": "What is not associated with DIC -",
        "exp": "Plasma fibrinogen levels are reduced due to consumption in microvascular coagulation by which intravascular clotting occurs. Reference to earlier comments on normal blood coagulation (Chapter 3) may be helpful at this point. It suffices here to recall that clotting can be initiated by either the extrinsic pathway, which is triggered by the release of tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin); or the intrinsic pathway, which involves the activation of factor XII by surface contact, collagen, or other negatively charged substances. Both pathways lead to the generation of throm- bin. Clotting normally is limited by the rapid clearance of activated clotting factors by the macrophages and the liver, endogenous anticoagulants (e. g., protein C), and the con- comitant activation of fibrinolysis. DIC usually is triggered by either (1) the release of tissue factor or thromboplastic substances into the circulation or (2) widespread endothelial cell damage (Fig. 11-28). Throm- boplastic substances can be released into the circulation from a variety of sources--for example, the placenta in obstetric complications or ceain types of cancer cells, paicularly those of acute promyelocytic leukemia and adenocarcino- mas. Cancer cells can also provoke coagulation in other ways, such as by releasing proteolytic enzymes and by expressing tissue factor. In gram-negative and gram-positive sepsis (impoant causes of DIC), endotoxins or exotoxins stimu- late the release of tissue factor from monocytes. Activated monocytes also release IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor, both of which stimulate the expression of tissue factor on endo- thelial cells and simultaneously decrease the expression of thrombomodulin. The latter, you may recall, activates protein C, an anticoagulant (Chapter 3). The net result of these alterations is the enhanced generation of thrombin and the blunting of inhibitory pathways that limit coagulation. Severe endothelial cell injury can initiate DIC by causing the release of tissue factor and by exposing subendothelial col- lagen and von Willebrand factor (v. WF). However, even subtle forms of endothelial damage can unleash procoagulant activity by stimulating the increased expression of tissue factor on endothelial cell surfaces. Widespread endothelial injury can be produced by the deposition of antigen-antibody complexes (e. g., in systemic lupus erythematosus), by tem- perature extremes (e. g., after heat stroke or burn injury), or by infections (e. g., due to meningococci or rickettsiae). As discussed in Chapter 3, endothelial injury is an impoant consequence of endotoxemia, and, not surprisingly, DIC is a frequent complication of gram-negative sepsis. Disorders associated with DIC are listed in Table 11-12. Of these, DIC is most often associated with sepsis, obstetric complications, malignancy, and major trauma (especially trauma to the brain). The initiating events in these conditions are multiple and often interrelated. For example, in obstetric conditions, tissue factor derived from the placenta, retained dead fetus, or amniotic fluid enters the circulation; however, shock, hypoxia, and acidosis often coexist and can lead to widespread endothelial injury. Trauma to the brain releases fat and phospholipids, which act as contact factors and thereby activate the intrinsic arm of the coagulation cascade. Whatever the pathogenetic mechanism, DIC has two con- sequences. First, there is widespread fibrin deposition within the microcirculation. The associated obstruction leads to ischemia in the more severely affected or vulnerable organs and hemolysis as red cells are traumatized while passing through vessels narrowed by fibrin thrombi (micro- angiopathic hemolytic anemia). Second, a bleeding diathesis results from the depletion of platelets and clotting factors and the secondary release of plasminogen activators. Plasmin cleaves not only fibrin (fibrinolysis) but also factors V and VIII, thereby reducing their concentration fuher. In addition, fibrinolysis creates fibrin degradation products. These inhibit platelet aggregation, have antithrombin activity, and impair fibrin polymerization, all of which contribute to the hemostatic failure (Fig. 11-28).

Its a disease results from acquired mutation in PIGA an enzyme that is essential for the synthesis of ceain membrane associated complement regulatory proteins. Thrombosis is the leading cause of disease related death in PNH. About 40% patient suffer from venous thrombosis of hepatic, poal or cerebral veins. In PNH GPI linked proteins are deficient because of somatic mutation that inactivate PIGA. In RBC proteins are attached to cell membrane through a linkage to a specialised phospholipid called GPI. It is hypothesised that bone marrow cells with PIGA mutation increase in numbers only in rare instances where they have selective advantages such as in setting autoimmune reaction against GPI linked antigens. This explains the frequent association of PNH with aplastic anemia. Red cell deficient in these GPI linked factors are abnormally susceptible to lysis or injury by complement.

Two mechanisms contribute to the anemia in b-thalassemia. The reduced synthesis of b-globin leads to inadequate HbA formation and results in the production of poorly hemoglobinized red cells that are pale (hypochro- mic) and small in size (microcytic). Even more impoant is the imbalance in b-globin and a-globin chain syn- thesis, as this creates an excess of unpaired a chains that aggregate into insoluble precipitates, which bind and severely damage the membranes of both red cells and erythroid pre- cursors. A high fraction of the damaged erythroid precursors die by apoptosis (Fig. 11-6), a phenomenon termed ineffec- tive erythropoiesis, and the few red cells that are produced have a shoened life span due to extravascular hemoly- sis. Ineffective hematopoiesis has another untoward effect: It is associated with an inappropriate increase in the absorption of dietary iron, which without medical intervention inevitably leads to iron overload. The increased iron absorption is caused by inappropriately low levels of hepcidin, which is a negative regulator of iron absorption (see later). Ref: Robbins pathologic basis of disease 9/e.

        "question": "Which propey of hemoglobin is affected in sickle cell anemia",
        "exp": "On deoxygenation, HbS molecules form long polymers by means of intermolecular contacts that involve the abnormal valine residue at position 6. These polymers disto the red cell, which assumes an elongated crescentic, or sickle, shape (Fig. 11-3). The sickling of red cells initially is reversible upon reoxygenation. However, the distoion of the membrane that is produced by each sickling episode leads to an influx of calcium, which causes the loss of potassium and water and also damages the membrane skeleton. Over time, this cumu- lative damage creates irreversibly sickled cells, which are rapidly hemolyzed. Many variables influence the sickling of red cells in vivo. The three most impoant factors are * The presence of hemoglobins other than HbS. In heterozygotes approximately 40% of Hb is HbS and the remainder is HbA, which interacts only weakly with deox- ygenated HbS. Because the presence of HbA greatly retards the polymerization of HbS, the red cells of het- erozygotes have little tendency to sickle in vivo. Such persons are said to have sickle cell trait. HbC, another mutant b-globin, has a lysine residue instead of the normal glutamic acid residue at position 6. About 2. 3% of Ameri- can blacks are heterozygous carriers of HbC; as a result, about 1 in 1250 newborns are compound heterozygotes for HbC and HbS. Because HbC has a greater tendency to aggregate with HbS than does HbA, HbS/HbC com- pound heterozygotes have a symptomatic sickling disorder called Hb. SC disease. HbF interacts weakly with HbS, so newborns with sickle cell anemia do not manifest the disease until HbF falls to adult levels, generally around the age of 5 to 6 months. * The intracellular concentration of HbS. The polyA merization of deoxygenated HbS is strongly concentration- dependent. Thus, red cell dehydration, which increases the Hb concentration, facilitates sickling. Conversely, the coexistence of a-thalassemia (described later), which decreases the Hb concentration, reduces sickling. The relatively low concentration of HbS also contributes to the absence of sickling in heterozygotes with sickle cell trait. in the spleen and the bone marrow, two tissues promi- nently affected by sickle cell disease. Sickling also can be triggered in other microvascular beds by acquired factors that retard the passage of red cells. As described previ- ously, inflammation slows the flow of blood by increasing the adhesion of leukocytes and red cells to endothelium and by inducing the exudation of fluid through leaky vessels. In addition, sickle red cells have a greater tendency than normal red cells to adhere to endothelial cells, appar- ently because repeated bouts of sickling causes mem- brane damage that make them sticky. These factors conspire to prolong the transit times of sickle red cells, increasing the probability of clinically significant sickling. Two major consequences arise from the sickling of red cells (Fig. 11-4). First, the red cell membrane damage and dehydration caused by repeated episodes of sickling produce a chronic hemolytic anemia. The mean life span of red cells in sickle cell anemia is only 20 days (one sixth of normal). Second, red cell sickling produces widespread microvascular obstructions, which result in ischemic tissue damage and pain crises. Vaso-occlusion does not cor- relate with the number of irreversibly sickled cells and there- fore appears to result from factors such as infection, inflammation, dehydration, and acidosis that enhance the sickling of reversibly sickled cells.

They are typically inherited from one's parents through an X chromosome with a nonfunctional gene.

Other types include haemophilia C, which occurs due to low levels of factor XI, and parahaemophilia, which occurs due to low levels of factor V.

After half an hour the contents of both the tubes are shaken and the tubes held against a white paper on which a thin black line is drawn. The line is clearly visible through the contents of the tube containing distilled water due to complete lysis. If the line is visible through the contents of the tube with buffered saline, the test is negative, whereas if the line is not visible, the test is positive.*Interpretation: A positive NESTROFT indicates that all red cells in the tested sample have not undergone lysis in 0. 36% buffered saline.

The excessive red cell destruction and resultant anemia lead to a compensatory hyperplasia of red cell progenitors in the marrow and an increase in red cell production marked by reticulocytosis. Splenomegaly is more common and prominent in hereditary spherocytosis than in any other form of hemolytic anemia. The splenic weight usually is between 500 and 1000 g. The enlargement results from marked congestion of the splenic cords and increased numbers of tissue macrophages. Phagocytosed red cells are seen within macrophages lining the sinusoids and, in paicular, within the cords. In long-standing cases there is prominent systemic hemosiderosis. The other general fea- tures of hemolytic anemias also are present, including cho- lelithiasis, which occurs in 40% to 50% of patients with hereditary spherocytosis. Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by abnormalities in the membrane skeleton, a network of proteins that underlies lipid bilayer of the red cell (Fig. 11-1). The major membrane skeleton protein is spectrin, a long, flexible het- erodimer that self-associates at one end and binds sho actin filaments at its other end. These contacts create a two- dimensional meshwork that is linked to the overlying mem- brane through ankyrin and band 4. 2 to the intrinsic membrane protein called band 3, and through band 4. 1 to glycophorin. The mutations in hereditary spherocytosis most frequently involve ankyrin, band 3, and spectrin, but mutations in other components of the skeleton have also been described. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 410",

The bone marrow is markedly hyper- cellular and contains numerous megaloblastic erythroid pro- genitors. Megaloblasts are larger than normal erythroid progenitors (normoblasts) and have delicate, finely reticu- lated nuclear chromatin (indicative of nuclear immaturity) (Fig. 11-11). As megaloblasts differentiate and acquire hemo- globin, the nucleus retains its finely distributed chromatin and fails to undergo the chromatin clumping typical of normo- blasts. The granulocytic precursors also demonstrate nuclear- cytoplasmic asynchrony, yielding giant metamyelocytes. Megakaryocytes may also be abnormally large and have bizarre multilobed nuclei. In the peripheral blood the earliest change is the appear- ance of hypersegmented neutrophils, which appear before the onset of anemia. Normal neutrophils have three or four nuclear lobes, but in megaloblastic anemias they often have five or more. The red cells typically include large, egg- shaped macro-ovalocytes; the mean cell volume often is greater than 110 fL (normal, 82 to 92 fL). Although macro- cytes appear hyperchromic, in reality the mean cell hemoglo- bin concentration is normal. Large, misshapen platelets also may be seen. Morphologic changes in other systems, espe- cially the gastrointestinal tract, also occur, giving rise to some of the clinical manifestations. Refer robbins 9/e pg 422",

The severity of the disease is propoional to the number of a-globin genes that are missing (Table 11-3). For example, the loss of a single a-globin gene produces a silent- carrier state, whereas the deletion of all four a-globin genes is lethal in utero because the red cells have viually no oxygen-delivering capacity. With loss of three a-globin genes there is a relative excess of b-globin or (early in life) g-globin chains. Excess b-globin and g-globin chains form relatively stable b4 and g4 tetramers known as HbH and Hb Ba, respectively, which cause less membrane damage than the free a-globin chains that are found in b-thalassemia; as a result, ineffective erythropoiesis is less pronounced in a-thalassemia.

Recent evidence suggests a pathological role of persistent glomerular microhematuria in the progression of renal disease. Moreover, gross hematuria, or macrohematuria, promotes acute kidney injury (AKI), with subsequent impairment of renal function in a high propoion of patients. In this pathological context, hemoglobin, heme, or iron released from red blood cells in the urinary space may cause direct tubular cell injury, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and fuher monocyte/macrophage recruitment.

Author information Abstract To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain in the diagnosis of acute leukemia in light of the finer characterization of this disorder now available through immunophenotyping, we examined the blasts from 51 patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia by morphological, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic analyses. The 51 patients represented every new case of acute leukemia subjected to cytochemical stains and flow cytometry between July 1987 and February 1989. By cell-surface marker analysis, 29 exhibited lymphocytic lineage, while 21 were myelocytic. One was mixed lineage. The PAS positivity, defined by the presence of blocks or coarse granules in 5% or more of the blasts, was found in 15 of 29 lymphoblastic leukemias and in four of the myeloblastic leukemias. However, PAS-positive lymphoblastic leukemias were negative with the other cytochemical stains: myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase. The PAS-positive myeloblastic leukemias were positive with at least one other stain. Three cases of myeloblastic leukemia exhibited greater than 10% PAS-positive blasts, with all three being acute monoblastic leukemia. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the PAS stain alone for lymphoblastic leukemia was 52% (15 true positives of 29) and 81% (four false positives), respectively.",

Symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Often there will be non-painful enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, under the arm, or in the groin. Those affected may feel tired or be itchy. About half of cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma are due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Other risk factors include a family history of the condition and having HIV/AIDS. There are two major types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. Diagnosis is by finding Hodgkin's cells such as multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells (RS cells) in lymph nodes. Hodgkin lymphoma may be treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplant. The choice of treatment often depends on how advanced the cancer is and whether or not it has orable features. In early disease a cure is often possible. The percentage of people who survive five years in the United States is 86%. For those under the age of 20 rates of survival are 97%. Radiation and some chemotherapy drugs, however, increase the risk of other cancers, heart disease, or lung disease over the subsequent decades.",

With the establishment of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for detecting the JAK2 V617F mutation, this may become the first molecular diagnostic marker for PV, similar to BCR/ABL for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, because of a paucity of centers doing red blood cell mass measurements, demonstrating an elevated red blood cell mass continues to become more difficult. The diagnostic criteria set by the PVSG are organized into two categories, A and B. The diagnosis of PV is established if all three category A criteria are present, or if criteria A1 plus A2 plus any two criteria from category B are present. Category A criteria are as follows: Total red blood cell mass >=36 mL/kg in males or >=32 mL/kg in females Aerial oxygen saturation >=92% Splenomegaly Category B criteria are as follows: Thrombocytosis, with platelet count >400, 000/mL Leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count >12, 000/mL Increased leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (ALP) >100 U/L emedicine. medscape. com",

        "exp": "Iron deficiency anemia develops when body stores of iron drop too low to suppo normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Inadequate dietary iron, impaired iron absorption, bleeding, or loss of body iron in the urine may be the cause. Iron equilibrium in the body normally is regulated carefully to ensure that sufficient iron is absorbed in order to compensate for body losses of iron (see the image below). The total body iron in a 70-kg man is about 4 g. This is maintained by a balance between absorption and body losses. Although the body only absorbs 1 mg daily to maintain equilibrium, the internal requirement for iron is greater (20-25 mg). An erythrocyte has a lifespan of 120 days so that 0. 8% of red blood cells are destroyed and replaced each day. A man with 5 L of blood volume has 2. 5 g of iron incorporated into the hemoglobin, with a daily turnover of 20 mg for hemoglobin synthesis and degradation and another 5 mg for other requirements. Most of this iron passes through the plasma for reutilization. Iron in excess of these requirements is deposited in body stores as ferritin or hemosiderin Ref Robbins 9/e pg 440",

One of the interesting ones is a mutation in a transcription factor that is required for the TH17 response. The resulting disease manifestations include fungal (and occasionally bacterial) skin infections and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. By contrast, mutations in genes involved in TH1 responses result in susceptibility to infections with atypical mycobacteria. These observations emphasize the impoance of TH17 cells for defense against fungal infec- tions and of TH1 cells for combating intracellular bacterial infections.
