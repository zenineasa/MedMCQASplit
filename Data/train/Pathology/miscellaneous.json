        "exp": "Gastritis is a nonspecific term that describes any inflammation of the gastric mucosa. Acute gastritis refers to the clinical situation of gastric mucosal erosions (not mucosal ulcers). Acute gastritis is also known as hemorrhagic gastritis or acute erosive gastritis. Acute gastritis is associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and coicosteroids, and also with alcohol, chemotherapy, ischemia, shock, and even severe stress. Two types of stress ulcers are Curling's ulcers, seen in patients with severe burns, and Cushing's ulcers, seen in patients with intracranial lesions. Grossly acute gastritis appears as multiple, scattered, punctate (less than 1 cm) hemorrhagic areas in the gastric mucosa. This is helpful in differentiating acute gastritis from peptic ulcers, which tend to be solitary and larger. Microscopically the gastric mucosa from a patient with acute gastritis is likely to reveal mucosal erosions, scattered neutrophils, edema, and possibly hemorrhage. Acute gastritis. Erosion and complete effacement of the epithelium is observed. The residual glands, on the left, display regenerative changes with basophilic epithelium.

Clinically, fibroadenomas are rubbery, freely movable, oval nodules that usually measure 2 to 4 cm in diameter. Numerous neutrophils are seen in acute bacterial infection of the breast (acute mastitis), which is usually seen in the postpaum lactating or involuting breast. Dilation of the breast ducts (ectasia) with inspissation of breast secretions is characteristic of mammary duct ectasia, which is common in elderly women.

        "exp": "Symptoms not caused by either local or metastatic effects of tumors are called paraneoplastic syndromes. Bronchogenic carcinomas are associated with the development of many different types of paraneoplastic syndromes. These syndromes are usually associated with the secretion of ceain substances by the tumor cells. For example, ectopic secretion of ACTH may produce Cushing's syndrome, while ectopic secretion of antidiuretic hormone (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion) may produce hyponatremia. Hypocalcemia may result from the production of calcitonin, while hypercalcemia may result from the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is a normal substance produced locally by many different types of tissue. PTHrP is distinct from parathyroid hormone (PTH) patients with this type of paraneoplastic syndrome have increased calcium levels and decreased PTH levels. As a result of decreased PTH production, all of the parathyroid glands in these patients are atrophic. Other tumors associated with the production of PTHrP include clear cell carcinomas of the kidney, endometrial adenocarcinomas, and transitional carcinomas of the urinary bladder. Lung cancers are also associated with multiple, migratory venous thromboses. This migratory thrombophlebitis is called Trousseau's sign and is more classically associated with carcinoma of the pancreas. Hyperophic osteoahropathy is a syndrome consisting of periosteal new bone formation with or without digital clubbing and joint effusion. It is most commonly found in association with lung carcinoma, but it also occurs with other types of pulmonary disease. Erythrocytosis is associated with increased erythropoietin levels and some tumors, paicularly renal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and cerebellar hemangioblastomas.

        "exp": "The metabisulfite test is used to detect the presence of hemoglobin S, but it does not differentiate the heterozygous sickle cell trait from the homozygous sickle cell disease. The test is based on the fact that erythrocytes with a large propoion of hemoglobin S sickle in solutions of low oxygen content. Metabisulfite is a reducing substance that enhances the process of deoxygenation. The osmotic fragility test is a diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis. Spherocytes lyse at a higher concentration of salt than do normal cells, thus causing an increased osmotic fragility. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT), or Coombs' test, is used to differentiate autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) due to the presence of anti-red cell antibodies from other forms of hemolytic anemia. In this test, antibodies to human immunoglobulin cause the agglutination (clotting) of red cells if these anti-red cell antibodies are present on the surface of the red cells. In patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, the erythrocytes are excessively sensitive to complement-mediated lysis in low ionic environments (the basis for the sucrose hemolysis test) or in acidotic conditions, such as sleep, exercise, or the Ham's acid hemolysis test. The Schilling test, which measures intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 with and without intrinsic factor, is used to diagnose decreased vitamin B12 caused by pernicious anemia, which is characterized by a lack of intrinsic factor.

        "exp": "Germ cell tumors of the testis often secrete enzymes or polypeptide hormones, examples of which include a fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (h. CG). AFP is synthesized by the fetal gut, liver, and yolk sac. It may be secreted by either yolk sac tumors (endodermal sinus tumors) or embryonal carcinomas. AFP may also be secreted by liver cell carcinomas. b-h. CG is a glycoprotein that is normally synthesized by placental syncytiotrophoblasts. Markedly elevated serum levels are most often associated with choriocarcinomas, which are characterized histologically by a mixture of malignant cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Mildly elevated serum levels of b-h. CG may be found in patients with other types of germ cell tumors if they contain syncytiotrophoblast-like giant cells. This is found in about 10% of classic seminomas, which are characterized histologically by large cells with distinct cell membranes and clear cytoplasm. An impoant, distinct variant of seminoma is the spermatocytic seminoma. It is characterized by being found in older individuals and by the fact that it does not metastasize. Histologically, a spermatocytic seminoma is characterized by maturation of the tumor cells, some of which histologically resemble secondary spermatocytes. To summarize: markedly elevated levels of h. CG are associated with choriocarcinomas, while elevated levels of AFP are most characteristic of yolk sac tumors and embryonal carcinomas. But there are many areas of overlap between tumors, and many tumors are composed of multiple types of germ cell cancers. The only definitive statement that can be made is that elevated serum levels of AFP cannot be seen in a tumor that is a pure seminoma.

        "exp": "IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Iron Metabolism The amount of iron obtained from the diet should replace the losses from the skin, bowel and genitourinary tract. These losses together are about 1 mg daily in an adult male or in a non-menstruating female, while in a menstruating woman there is an additional iron loss of 0. 5-1 mg daily. ABSORPTION. Iron is absorbed mainly in the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Iron from a diet containing haem is better absorbed than non-haem iron. Absorption of non-haem iron is enhanced by factors such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), citric acid, amino acids, sugars, gastric secretions and hydrochloric acid. Iron absorption is impaired by factors like medicinal antacids, milk, pancreatic secretions, phytates, phosphates, ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and tannates contained in tea. Transpo across the membrane is accomplished by divalent metal transpoer 1 (DMT 1). Once inside the gut cells, ferric iron may be either stored as ferritin or fuher transpoed to transferrin by two vehicle proteins--ferropoin and hephaestin. The major mechanism of maintaining iron balance in the body is by intestinal absorption of dietary iron. When the demand for iron is increased (e. g. during pregnancy, menstruation, periods of growth and various diseases), there is increased iron absorption, while excessive body stores of iron cause reduced intestinal iron absorption. TRANSPO. Iron is transpoed in plasma bound to a b-globulin, transferrin, synthesised in the liver. Transferrin-bound iron is made available to the marrow where the developing erythroid cells having transferring receptors utilise iron for hemoglobin synthesis. Transferrin is reutilised after iron is released from it. But in conditions where transferrin-iron saturation is increased, parenchymal iron uptake is increased. The storage form of iron (ferritin and haemosiderin) in RE cells is normally not functional but can be readily mobilised in response to increased demands for erythropoiesis.

It results from a genetic deficiency of one of the enzymes required for the synthesis of haem, resulting in excessive production of porphyrins. Often, the genetic deficiency is precipitated by the intake of some drugs. Porphyrias are associated with excretion of intermediate products in the urine--delta-aminolaevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and protoporphyrin. Porphyrias are broadly of 2 types--erythropoietic and hepatic. (a) Erythropoietic porphyrias: These have a defective synthesis of haem in the red cell precursors in the bone marrow. These may be fuher of 2 subtypes: Congenital erythropoietic porphyria, in which the urine is red due to the presence of uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin. The skin of these infants is highly photosensitive. Bones and skin show red-brown discolouration. Erythropoietic protoporphyria, in which there is an excess of protoporphyrin but no excess of porphyrin in the urine. (b) Hepatic porphyrias. These are more common and have a normal erythroid precursor but have a defect in the synthesis of haem in the liver. Its fuher subtypes include the following: Acute intermittent porphyria is characterised by acute episodes of 3 patterns: abdominal, neurological, and psychotic. These patients do not have photosensitivity. There is excessive delta-aminolaevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in the urine. Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common of all porphyrias. Porphyrins collect in the liver and a small quantity is excreted in the urine. Skin lesions are similar to those of invariegate porphyria. Most of the patients have associated haemosiderosis with cirrhosis which may eventually develop into hepatocellular carcinoma. Mixed (Variegate) porphyrias.

Lichen sclerosis is seen histologically as atrophy of the epidermis with underlying dermal fibrosis. This abnormality is seen in postmenopausal women, who develop pruritic white plaques of the vulva. It is not thought to be premalignant. Loss of pigment in the epidermis (vitiligo) can also produce leukoplakia. Inflammatory skin diseases, such as chronic dermal inflammation, squamous hyperplasia (characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis), and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (characterized by epithelial atypia or dysplasia), can also present with leukoplakia. A term related to leukoplakia is vulvar dystrophy, but this refers specifically to either lichen sclerosis or squamous hyperplasia. Because the latter is sometimes associated with epithelial dysplasia, it is also referred to as hyperplastic dystrophy. It is most commonly seen in postmenopausal women. The male counterpa of lichen sclerosis, called balanitis xerotica obliterans, is found on the penis. Paget's disease is a malignant tumor that can be found in the breast or the vulva.

        "question": "During a viral infection, a 23-year-old female develops enlarged lymph nodes at multiple sites (lymphadenopathy). A biopsy from one of these enlarged lymph nodes reveals a proliferation of reactive T immunoblasts, cells that have prominent nucleoli. These reactive T cells are most likely to be found in which one of the following regions of the lymph node?",
        "exp": "Lymph nodes may be enlarged (lymphadenopathy) secondary to reactive processes, which can be either acute or chronic. Acute reaction (acute nonspecific lymphadenitis) can result in focal or generalized lymphadenopathy. Focal lymph node enlargement is usually the result of bacterial infection. Sections from involved lymph nodes reveal infiltration by neutrophils. In contrast, generalized acute lymphadenopathy is usually the result of viral infections and usually produces a proliferation of reactive T lymphocytes called T immunoblasts. These reactive T cells tend to have prominent nucleoli and can be easily mistaken for malignant lymphocytes or malignant Hodgkin cells. Reactive processes involving lymph nodes typically involve different and specific poions of the lymph nodes depending upon the type of cell that is reacting. For example, reactive B lymphocytes typically result in hyperplasia of the lymphoid follicles and germinal centers (follicular hyperplasia). Examples of diseases that are associated with follicular hyperplasia include chronic inflammation caused by organisms, rheumatoid ahritis, and AIDS. Lymph nodes from patients with AIDS undergo characteristic changes that begin with follicular hyperplasia with loss of mantle zones, intrafollicular hemorrhage (\"follicle lysis\"), and monocytoid B cell proliferation. Subsequently there is depletion of lymphocytes (CD4+ lymphocytes) in both the follicles and the interfollicular areas. In contrast to reactive B cell processes, reactive T lymphocytes typically result in hyperplasia involving the T cell areas of the lymph node, namely the interfollicular regions and the paracoex. Examples of clinical situations associated with a T lymphocyte response include viral infections, vaccinations, use of some drugs (paicularly Dilantin), and systemic lupus erythematosus. The sinusoidal pattern of reaction involves expansion of the sinuses by benign macrophages, as seen in reactive proliferations of the mononuclearphagocytic system. Stellate microabscesses (irregular areas composed of central necrotic cellular and neutrophil debris surrounded by palisading macrophages) are characteristic of cat-scratch disease, lymphogranuloma venereum, and tularemia Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",

        "exp": "The two inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are both chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorders of unknown etiology. They both may show very similar morphologic features and associations, such as mucosal inflammation, malignant transformation, and extragastrointestinal manifestations that include erythema nodosum (especially ulcerative colitis), ahritis, uveitis, pericholangitis (especially with ulcerative colitis, in which sclerosing pericholangitis may produce obstructive jaundice), and ankylosing spondylitis. CD is classically described as being a granulomatous disease, but granulomas are present in only 25 to 75% of cases. Therefore, the absence of granulomas does not rule out the diagnosis of CD. CD may involve any poion of the gastrointestinal tract and is characterized by focal (segmental) involvement with \"skip lesions. \" Involvement of the intestines by CD is typically transmural inflammation, which leads to the formation of fistulas and sinuses. The deep inflammation produces deep longitudinal, serpiginous ulcers, which impa a \"cobblestone\" appearance to the mucosal surface of the colon. Additionally in Crohn's disease, the mesenteric fat wraps around the bowel surface, producing what is called \"creeping fat, \" and the thickened wall narrows the lumen, producing a characteristic \"string sign\" on x-ray. This narrowing of the colon, which may produce intestinal obstruction, is grossly described as a \"lead pipe\" or \"garden hose\" colon. In contrast to CD, UC affects only the colon, and the disease involvement is continuous. The rectum is involved in all cases, and the inflammation extends proximally. Since UC involves the mucosa and submucosa, but not the wall, fistula formation and wall thickening are absent (but toxic megacolon may occur). Grossly, the mucosa displays diffuse hyperemia with numerous superficial ulcerations.

It is most likely associated with an endocrine imbalance that causes an abnormality of the normal monthly cyclic events within the breast. These fibrocystic changes are subdivided into nonproliferative and proliferative changes. Nonproliferative changes include fibrosis of the stroma and cystic dilation of the terminal ducts, which when large may form blue-domed cysts. A common feature of the ducts in nonproliferative changes is apocrine metaplasia, which refers to epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with apical snouts. Proliferative changes include epithelial hyperplasia of the ducts. This hyperplastic epithelium may form papillary structures (papillomatosis when pronounced), or may be quite abnormal (atypical hyperplasia). Two benign, but clinically impoant, forms of proliferative fibrocystic change include sclerosing adenosis and radial scar. Both of these may be mistaken histologically for infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but the presence of myoepithelial cells is a helpful sign that points to the benign nature of the proliferation. Sclerosing adenosis is a disease of the terminal lobules that is typically seen in patients 35 to 45 years old. It produces a firm mass, most often located in the upper outer quadrant. Microscopically there is florid proliferation of small ductal structures in a fibrous stroma, which on low power is stellate in appearance and somewhat maintains the normal lobular architecture.

        "exp": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal stem cell disorder that is characterized by abnormal red cells, granulocytes, and platelets. The red blood cells (RBCs) are abnormally sensitive to the lytic activity of complement due to a deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) linked proteins, namely decay-accelerating factor (DAF, or CD 55), membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (CD55), or CD59 (a C8 binding protein). Complement is normally activated by acidotic states, such as occur with exercise or sleep. In patients with PNH, the acidotic condition that develops during sleep (which is usually at night) causes hemolysis of red blood cells and results in red urine in the morning. The erythrocytes of these patients lyse in vitro with acid (Ham's test) or sucrose (sucrose lysis test). Complications of PNH include the development of frequent thromboses, paicularly of the hepatic, poal, or cerebral veins. Since PNH is a clonal stem cell disorder, patients are at an increased risk of developing aplastic anemia or acute leukemia. The autoimmune hemolytic anemias are impoant causes of acute anemia in a wide variety of clinical states and can be separated into two main types: those secondary to \"warm\" antibodies and those reactive at cold temperatures. Warm-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemias react at 37degC in vitro, are composed of IgG, and do not fix complement. They are found in patients with malignant tumors, especially leukemia-lymphoma; with use of such drugs as a-methyldopa; and in the autoimmune diseases, especially lupus erythematosus.

Histologic changes depend on the stage of the disease. Cystic dysplasia is characterized by undifferentiated mesenchyme and immature cailage and collecting ductules.

This histologic diversity has given rise tothe alternative, albeit less preferred name mixed tumor. Thetumors consistently overexpress the transcription factor.

Pleomorphic adenomas typically manifest as rounded, well-demarcatedmasses rarely exceeding 6 cm in the greatestdimension. Although they are encapsulated, in some locations(paicularly the palate), the capsule is not fully developed, and expansile growth produces protrusions into thesurrounding tissues. The cut surface is gray-white and typicallycontains myxoid and blue translucent chondroid(cailage-like) areas. The most striking histologicfeature is their characteristic heterogeneity. Epithelial elements resembling ductal or myoepithelial cells are arrangedin ducts, acini, irregular tubules, strands, or evensheets. These typically are dispersed within a mesenchyme-likebackground of loose myxoid tissue containingislands of chondroid and, rarely, foci of bone (Fig. 14-6). Sometimes the epithelial cells form well-developed ductslined by cuboidal to columnar cells with an underlying layerof deeply chromatic, small myoepithelial cells. In otherinstances, there may be strands or sheets of myoepithelialcells. Islands of well-differentiated squamous epithelium alsomay be present.

Plasma cell interstitial nephritis is seen in immunologic rejection of transplanted kidneys. Nodular glomerulosclerosis is an effect of diabetes mellitus. The presence of red blood cell casts in the urine nearly always indicates that there has been glomerular injury but is not specific for any given cause. Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane caused by subepithelial immune deposits is seen in membranous glomerulonephritis. While the morphology of membranous glomerulonephritis is different from that of nephritis caused by circulating antigen-antibody complexes (immune complexes), there are similarities in the pathogenesis in that both disorders may be a consequence of or exist in association with infections such as hepatitis B, syphilis, or malaria. Other causes of membranous glomerulonephritis include reactions to penicillamine and gold, and ceain malignancies such as malignant melanoma.

In the late stage, glandular parenchyma is replaced by fat and fibrous tissue. The ducts are also fibrosed and hyalinised. CLINICAL FEATURES. It is clinically characterized by: Symptoms referable to eyes such as blurred vision, burning, and itching. Symptoms referable to xerostomia such as fissured oral mucosa, dryness, and difficulty in swallowing.

It is equally common in men and women. There are 3 distinctive features which distinguish medullary carcinoma from the other thyroid carcinomas. They are: its familial occurrence, secretion of calcitonin and other peptides, and amyloid stroma. 1. Familial occurrence. Most cases of medullary carcinoma occur sporadically, but about 10% have a genetic background with point mutation in RET-protooncogene located on chromosome 10q. The familial form of medullary carcinoma in association with pheochromocytoma and parathyroid adenoma (multiple endocrine neoplasias, MEN II A), or with pheochromocytoma and multiple mucosal neuromas (MEN II B). 2. Secretion of calcitonin and other peptides. Like normal C-cells, tumour cells of medullary carcinoma secrete calcitonin, the hypocalcaemic hormone. In addition, the tumour may also elaborate prostaglandins, histaminase, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and ACTH. These hormone elaborations are responsible for a number of clinical syndromes such as carcinoid syndrome, Cushing's syndrome and diarrhoea. 3. Amyloid stroma. Most medullary carcinomas have amyloid deposits in the stroma which stains positively with usual amyloid stains such as Congo red. The amyloid deposits are believed to represent stored calcitonin derived from neoplastic C-cells in the form of prohormone. Most cases of medullary carcinoma present as solitary thyroid nodule but sometimes an enlarged cervical lymph node may be the first manifestation. Most medullary carcinomas are slow-growing. Regional lymph node metastases may occur but distant organ metastases are infrequent. The prognosis is better in familial form than in the sporadic form: overall 10-year survival rate is 60-70%.

        "exp": "The differential diagnosis of microcytosis includes b thalassemia (due to a defect in globin chain synthesis) and iron-deficiency anemia. It is impoant to distinguish between these two disorders because therapy with iron benefits patients with iron-deficiency anemia, but harms patients with thalassemia because these patients are at risk for iron overload. Both thalassemia minor and iron-deficiency anemia are microcytic disorders in which the mean corpuscular hemoglobin is usually found to be reduced. Red blood cell indexes may be useful in differentiating the two disorders because, while the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is often normal or only slightly reduced in association with thalassemia minor, the MCHC is often definitely reduced in association with iron-deficiency anemia. (Both pernicious and folate-deficiency anemias lead to megaloblastic changes in erythrocytes.) The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of variation in the size of the red cells (anisocytosis). The RDW is increased in patients with iron-deficiency anemia, but is normal in patients with b thalassemia. Also unique to the microcytic anemias is the fact that patients with b thalassemia have increased red blood cell counts, while patients with all of the other microcytic anemias have decreased red blood cell counts. This increased red cell count in b thalassemia may be due to the increased hemoglobin F, which shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. This in turn causes an increased release of erythropoietin. Unlike iron-deficiency anemia, b thalassemia begins as a microcytic anemia. In contrast, irondeficiency anemia progresses through several stages. First there is decreased storage iron, which is followed by decreased circulating iron. At this time patients are still not clinically anemic. Next patients develop a normocytic normochromic anemia that transforms into a microcytic normochromic anemia and finally a microcytic hypochromic anemia.

They arise in the myometrium, submucosally, subserosally, and midwall, both singly and several at a time. Sharply circumscribed, they are benign smooth-muscle tumors that are firm, gray-white, and whorled on cut section. Their malignant counterpa, leiomyosarcoma of the uterus, is quite rare in the de novo state and arises even more rarely from an antecedent leiomyoma. Whereas cell pleomorphism, tissue necrosis, and cytologic atypia per se are established criteria in assessing malignancy in tumors generally, they are impoant to the pathologist in uterine fibroids only if mitoses are also present. Regardless of cellularity or atypicality, if 10 or more mitoses are present in 10 separate high-power microscopic fields, the lesion is a leiomyosarcoma. If five or fewer mitoses are present in 10 fields with bland morphology, the leiomyoma will behave in a benign fashion. Problems arise when the mitotic counts range between three and seven per 10 fields with varying degrees of cell and tissue atypicality. These equivocal lesions should be regarded by both pathologist and clinician as \"gray-area\" smooth-muscle tumors of unpredictable biologic behavior.

The infection is transmitted through vaginal or anal intercourse and by autoinoculation. Initially, the lesion is in the form of a papule, a subcutaneous nodule or an ulcer. Within a few weeks, it develops into a raised, soft, painless, reddish ulcer with exuberant granulation tissue. Depending upon whether the individual is heterosexual or homosexual, the lesions are located on the penis, scrotum, genito-crural folds and inguinal folds, or in the perianal and anal area respectively. Regional lymphadenopathy generally does not occur. Microscopically, the margin of the ulcer shows epithelial hyperplasia. The ulcer bed shows neutrophilic abscesses.

Patients present with chronic rejection late after transplantation (months to years) with a progressive rise in serum creatinine levels (an index of renal function) over a period of 4 to 6 months. Chronic rejection is dominated by vascular changes, interstitial fibrosis, and loss of renal parenchyma; there are typically only mild or no ongoing cellular parenchymal infiltrates. The vascular changes occur predominantly in the aeries and aerioles, which exhibit intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. These lesions ultimately compromise vascular perfusion and result in renal ischemia manifested by loss or hyalinization of glomeruli, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. The vascular lesion may be caused by cytokines released by activated T cells that act on the cells of the vascular wall, and it may be the end stage of the proliferative aeritis described earlier.

This disease entity has many names, such as chronic interstitial pneumonitis and diffuse fibrosing alveolitis, but the common name is usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP). The form of this disease that progresses very rapidly is called Hamman-Rich syndrome. The pathogenesis of UIP involves damage to type I pneumocytes with the subsequent proliferation of type II pneumocytes and secretion of factors by macrophages that cause fibrosis. The end-stage form of IF is characterized by large cysts with intervening fibrosis, which impas the gross appearance of a \"honeycomb lung. \" There are several subtypes of IF, which are characterized by their histologic appearance. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) has numerous lymphocytes, Giant cell interstitial pneumonitis (GIP) has giant cells, and plasma cell interstitial pneumonitis (PIP) has numerous plasma cells. LIP is seen in patients with Sjogren's syndrome or AIDS and is associated with an increased risk of developing lymphoma. An impoant subtype is desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP), which is characterized histologically by sheets of cells within the alveoli. This type of IF may respond to the use of steroids.

The most common neoplasm of the parotid gland is the pleomorphic adenoma (mixed tumor), which histologically reveals epithelial structures embedded within a mesenchyme-like stroma consisting of mucoid, myxoid, or chondroid tissue. A malignant tumor may develop from a pleomorphic adenoma, in which case it is called a carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. The second most common tumor is Wahin's tumor (papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum), which histologically reveals cleftlike spaces lined by oncocytic epithelial cells overlying a stroma with a dense lymphocytic infiltrate. The epithelial cells are oncocytic because their pink cytoplasm is packed with mitochondria Three malignant tumors of the salivary glands are mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and acinic cell carcinoma. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas consist of a mixture of squamous epithelial cells and mucus-secreting cells. The mucus-secreting cells of a mucoepidermoid carcinoma can demonstrate intracellular mucin with a special mucicarmine stain. Adenoid cystic carcinomas form tubular or cribriform patterns histologically and have a tendency to invade along perineural spaces, especially the facial nerve. Acinic cell carcinomas contain glands with cleared or vacuolated epithelial cells. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",

        "exp": "The causes of malabsorption are vast, but in a few cases biopsy specimens of the small intestine may provide clues to a specific diagnosis. Whipple's disease is a systemic disease associated with malabsorption, fever, skin pigmentation, lymphadenopathy, and ahritis. Biopsy of the small intestine typically reveals the lamina propria to be infiltrated by numerous PAS-positive macrophages that contain glycoprotein and rod-shaped bacteria. The organism, Tropheryma whippelii, is a gram-positive actinomycete. The disease responds promptly to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Abetalipoproteinemia is a genetic defect in the synthesis of apolipoprotein B that leads to an inability to synthesize prebetalipoproteins (VLDLs), betalipoproteins (LDLs), and chylomicrons. These individuals have no chylomicrons, VLDLs, or LDLs in their blood. A biopsy of the small intestine reveals the mucosal absorptive cells to be vacuolated by lipid (triglyceride) inclusions, and peripheral smear reveals numerous acanthocytes, which are red blood cells that have numerous irregular spikes on their cell surface. The symptoms of malabsorption may be paially reversed by ingestion of medium-chain triglycerides rather than long-chain triglycerides, because these medium-chain triglycerides are absorbed directly into the poal system and are not incorporated into lipoproteins. Tropical and nontropical (celiac) sprue are both characterized by shoened to absent villi in the small intestines (atrophy). Celiac sprue is a disease of malabsorption related to a sensitivity to gluten, which is found in wheat, oats, barley, and rye. This disease is related to HLA-B8 and to previous infection with type 12 adenovirus. These patients respond to removal of gluten from their diet. Tropical sprue is an acquired disease found in tropical areas, such as the Caribbean, the Far East, and India. It is the result of a chronic bacterial infection. Granulomas in mucosa and submucosa of an intestinal biopsy, if infectious causes have been excluded, are highly suggestive of Crohn's disease. Fibrosis of the lamina propria and submucosa may be seen in patients with systemic sclerosis. Bacterial overgrowth, a result of numerous causes such as the blind loop syndrome, strictures, achlorhydria, or immune deficiencies, may also cause malabsorption.

Male infants with Bruton's disease begin having trouble with recurrent bacterial infections at about the age of 9 months, which is when maternal antibodies are no longer present in the affected infant. Therapy for Bruton's disease consists primarily of IV gamma globulin. Isolated deficiency of IgA is probably the most common form of immunodeficiency. It is due to a block in the terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes. Most patients are asymptomatic, but some develop chronic sinopulmonary infections. Patients are prone to developing diarrhea (Giardia infection) and also have an increased incidence of autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

        "exp": ") Pulmonary edema refers to excess accumulation of fluid in the extravascular spaces of the lung. Pulmonary edema can be classified based on the etiology into cardiogenic pulmonary edema and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema results from abnormalities of hemodynamic (Starling) forces, while noncardiogenic pulmonary edema results from cellular injury. Causes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema include increased hydrostatic forces, as seen with congestive heart failure (the most common cause of pulmonary edema); decreased oncotic pressure, such as resulting from decreased albumin levels; and lymphatic obstruction. Noncardiogenic edema may be the result of either endothelial injury (infections, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, or trauma) or alveolar injury (from inhaled toxins, aspiration, drowning, or near drowning). Microscopically, pulmonary edema reveals the alveoli to be filled with pale pink fluid. Cardiogenic edema may lead to alveolar hemorrhages and hemosiderin-laden macrophages (heart failure cells). Where cardiogenic edema is present, chest x-rays show an increase in the caliber of the blood vessels in the upper lobes, perivascular and peribronchial fluid (\"cuffing\"), and Kerley B lines (fluid in the interlobular septa). Noncardiogenic edema produces a \"whiteout\" of the lungs. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",

Cune-Albright syndrome ). MAS results from somatic mutations occurring during early development, resulting in a widespread mosaic of normal and mutant-bearing cells, which predicts that the clinical presentation of each patient is determined by the extent and distribution of abnormal cells. These mutations encode constitutively active forms of G(s)alpha, the ubiquitously expressed G protein alpha-subunit that couples hormone receptors to intracellular c. AMP generation. These mutations lead to substitution of amino acid residues that are critical for the intrinsic GTPase activity that is normally required to deactivate the G protein.

Histologic examination of sections taken from an exophytic lesion of the urinary bladder reveal groups of atypical cells with frequent mitoses forming finger-like projections that have thin, fibrovascular cores. These groups of atypical cells do not extend into the lamina propria and muscularis. No glands or keratin production are found. What is the most accurate diagnosis for this bladder tumor?",
        "exp": "Neoplastic lesions of the urinary bladder may either be benign or malignant. There is some controversy involving some types of benign lesions of the bladder. In paicular, there is disagreement as to whether papillary lesions may be benign (papillomas). Many pathologists would classify papillary transitional lesions that lack cellular atypia or numerous mitoses as grade I (low-grade) papillary transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) and not papillomas. Pathologists do agree, however, on the existence of a rare type of benign lesion called an inveed papilloma, which is characterized by nodular mucosal lesions that histologically have an endophytic growth pattern. Malignant neoplasms of the bladder may be transitional cell carcinomas, which are by far the most common type of tumor of the urinary bladder; squamous cell carcinomas, which produce keratin; or adenocarcinomas, which form glandular structures. TCCs may be either papillary or flat lesions. Papillary TCCs, which are the most common type of bladder cancer, may be either invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasive papillary TCCs are not referred to as being in situ, as that term implies a noninvasive, nonpapillary lesion. Nonpapillary (flat) TCCs may also be invasive (into the lamina propria or muscularis) or noninvasive (in situ). In contrast, squamous cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder are quite rare except in Egypt and other areas of the Middle East, where they are associated with schistosomiasis. Similarly, adenocarcinomas of the urinary bladder are quite rare, except that they may be associated with urachal epithelial remnants located in the dome of the bladder, glandular metaplasia, or cystitis glandularis.

        "exp": "Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) may produce oliguria, decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased fractional excretion of sodium, and an abnormal urinary sediment. ATN may be caused by renal ischemia (ischemic ATN) or chemical toxins (toxic ATN). Renal ischemia is the most common cause of ATN, while toxic ATN may be caused by antibiotics (such as aminoglycosides and amphotericin B), heavy metals (such as cisplatin), radiographic agents, and endogenous toxins (such as myoglobin and hemoglobin). Both ischemic ATN and toxic ATN are characterized by the finding of eosinophilic hyalin or pigmented granular casts in the urine. Histologically, both ischemic and toxic ATN reveal interstitial edema, flattening of the tubular epithelial cells, and tubular epithelial cell necrosis. One difference between these two etiologies is that the tubular epithelial cell necrosis is extensive with toxic ATN, while the necrosis with ischemic ATN is patchy with interposed unaffected segments. This can be quite variable, however, and ceain causes may be associated with damage to specific poions of the kidney. Both ischemia and heavy metals primarily damage the epithelial cells of the proximal straight tubules, while aminoglycosides primarily affect the proximal convoluted tubule.

The former is more common in elderly men, while the latter is more common in young women. The decrease in blood flow to the kidney with the renal aery obstruction (Goldblatt's kidney) causes hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus and increased renin production. This produces increased secretion of angiotensin and aldosterone, which leads to retention of sodium and water and produces hypertension. Increased levels of aldosterone also produce a hyperkalemic alkalosis. The kidney with stenosis of the renal aery becomes small and shrunken due to the effects of chronic ischemia, but the stenosis protects this kidney from the effects of the increased blood pressure.

They can be differentiated from true hemorrhages into the skin by the fact that they blanch if direct pressure is applied to them. True purpura may be caused by hemostatic or nonhemostatic defects. Hemostatic defects are caused by platelet or coagulation abnormalities, while nonhemostatic defects generally involve the blood vessels. These vascular abnormalities can be separated into palpable and nonpalpable purpura. The latter may be caused by excess coicosteroids (Cushing's syndrome), vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), infectious agents, or abnormal connective tissue diseases (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). Causes of palpable purpura include diseases that cause cutaneous vasculitis, such as collagen vascular diseases and Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

However, primary appendiceal carcinoid tumors, the most common gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors, very rarely metastasize and are viually always asymptomatic.

        "exp": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is primarily a disease of children and young adults that is characterized by the presence of numerous lymphoblasts within the bone marrow. These malignant cells may spill over into the blood and other organs. In contrast to myeloblasts, lymphoblasts do not contain myeloperoxidase, but they do stain positively with the PAS stain or acid phosphatase stain and for the enzyme TdT. The French-American-British (FAB) classification of ALL divides ALL into three types based on the morphology of the proliferating lymphoblasts. L1-ALL, seen in about 85% of the cases of ALL, consists of small homogeneous blasts. L2-ALL, seen in only 15% of cases of ALL, but more common in adults, consists of lymphoblasts that are larger and more heterogeneous (pleomorphic) than L1 blasts. These cells may also contain nuclear clefts. The final type of FAB ALL is the L3 type, which is seen in less than 1% of the cases of ALL. This form is essentially the leukemic form of Burkitt's lymphoma. Like the malignant cells of Burkitt's lymphoma, these L3-ALL cells are large blasts with cytoplasmic vacuoles that stain positively with the oil red O lipid stain. In contrast to the FAB classification of ALL, the immunologic classification of ALL is based on the developmental sequence of maturation of B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes. First it is necessary to determine whether the blasts have B cell or T cell markers. Most cases of ALL are of B cell origin; that is, the lymphoblasts express both CD19 and DR. A few cases of ALL are of T cell origin; the lymphoblasts lack CD19 and DR and instead express T cell antigens CD2, 5, and 7. Many cases of T-ALL involve a mediastinal mass and are clinically similar to cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma. To subclassify B-ALL, first determine if surface immunoglobulin (s. Ig) is present. Mature B-ALL cells (L3-ALL or Burkitt's lymphoma) have surface immunoglobulin, which is not found in the other types of B-ALL. These mature cells typically lack TdT, which is a marker for more immature cells. Next determine if there is cytoplasmic u present. Cytoplasmic u chains are specific for pre-B ALL cells, which have a characteristic translocation t(1; 19). The B cell ALL cells that lack both surface Ig and cytoplasmic u are called early pre-B-ALL and are separated into the CALLA (CD10)-positive and CALLA-negative types Acute Lymbhoblastic leukemia Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",

        "exp": "Decreased numbers of neutrophils in the peripheral blood (neutropenia) may be due to decreased production of neutrophils in the bone marrow or to increased peripheral destruction of neutrophils. Decreased production may be caused by megaloblastic anemia, ceain drugs, or stem cell defects such as aplastic anemia, leukemias, or lymphomas. Drug-induced destruction of neutrophil precursors is the most common cause of peripheral neutropenia. With all of these different causes of decreased neutrophil production, the bone marrow is hypoplastic and there is a decrease in the number of granulocytic precursors. Some causes of neutropenia also cause a decrease in the numbers of platelets and erythrocytes (pancytopenia). In contrast to decreased production, neutropenia secondary to peripheral destruction causes a hyperplasia of the bone marrow, with an increase in the number of granulocytic precursors. Causes of increased destruction of neutrophils include sequestration in the spleen due to hypersplenism (not splenic atrophy), increased utilization, such as with overwhelming infections, and immunologically mediated destruction (immune destruction). Causes of immune destruction include Felty's syndrome and ceain drug reactions, such as to aminopyrine and some sulfonamides. Drugs may cause decreased production or increased destruction of neutrophils. In the latter, antibodies are formed against neutrophils, and then these cells are destroyed peripherally. Felty's syndrome refers to the combination of rheumatoid ahritis, splenomegaly, and neutropenia.

        "exp": "Myelophthisic anemia results from space-occupying lesions of the bone marrow, such as granulomas or metastatic carcinomas.

This term refers to finding in the peripheral blood immature white cells, such as myelocytes and metamyelocytes, and immature red blood cells, such as nucleated red blood cells. Metastatic disease in the bone can produce localized bone pain and elevation of alkaline phosphatase that is associated with a normal g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level.

In addition to microangiopathic HA, other causes of IV mechanical destruction of red cells include march hemoglobinuria and ceain types of infections, such as baonellosis and malaria.

Subsequently thrombocytopenia develops and leads to a bleeding diathesis, seen as vomiting of blood and hematuria. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is separated from these two thrombotic microangiopathic syndromes by its excessive activation of the clotting system, which results in increased fibrin degradation products (FDP or FSP) and prolonged clotting times (PT and PTT) due to depletion of coagulation factors.

Primary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism that is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. The classic clinical triad for this disease consists of micronodular pigment cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and skin pigmentation. The combination of diabetes and skin pigmentation is called bronze diabetes. In the majority of patients serum iron is above 250 mg/dL, serum ferritin is above 500 ng/dL, and iron (transferrin) saturation approaches 100%. In patients with primary hemochromatosis, the excess iron is deposited in the cytoplasm of parenchymal cells of many organs, including the liver and pancreas. Liver deposition of iron leads to cirrhosis, which in turn increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Iron deposition in the islets of the pancreas leads to diabetes mellitus. Iron deposition in the hea leads to congestive heart failure, which is the major cause of death in these patients. Deposition of iron in the joints leads to ahritis, while deposition in the testes leads to atrophy. Secondary hemochromatosis, also called systemic hemosiderosis, is most common in patients with hemolytic anemias, such as thalassemia. Excess iron may also be due to an excessive number of transfusions or to increased absorption of dietary iron. In idiopathic (primary) hemochromatosis, iron accumulates in the cytoplasm of parenchymal cells, but in secondary hemochromatosis the iron is deposited in the mononuclear phagocytic system. In both conditions the iron is deposited as hemosiderin, which stains an intense blue color with Prussian blue stain.

In contrast to platelet aggregation, platelet secretion refers to the secretion of the contents of two types of granules within the platelet cytoplasm. a granules contain fibrinogen, fibronectin, and platelet-derived growth factor, while dense bodies contain ADP, ionized calcium, histamine, epinephrine, and serotonin. Decreased platelet secretion (activation defects) is seen with deficiencies of these granules; these diseases are called storage pool defects. They can involve either a granules (gray platelet syndrome) or dense bodies (Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, or TAR). Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disorder that is characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia (small platelets), and immunodeficiency consisting of decreased levels of IgM and progressive loss of T cell function. These patients have recurrent infections with bacteria, viruses, and fungi. TAR refers to the combination of thrombocytopenia and absent radii.

        "question": "An 8-month-old male infant presents with progressive renal and hepatic failure. Despite intensive medical therapy, the infant dies. At the time of autopsy, the external surfaces of his kidneys are found to be smooth, but cut section reveals numerous cysts that are lined up in a row. What is the mode of inheritance of this renal abnormality?",
        "exp": ") Cystic diseases of the kidney, which may be congenital, acquired, or inherited, have characteristic gross appearances. In two types of cystic renal disease, the numerous cysts are found in both the coex and medulla. These two types of polycystic disease of the kidney are the infantile type and the adult type. Adult polycystic kidney disease typically presents in adulthood and has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Histologically, the cysts are lined by tubular epithelium, while the stroma between the cysts is normal. Adult polycystic renal disease is associated with liver cysts and berry aneurysms, which may rupture and cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage. About one-half of patients with adult polycystic renal disease eventually develop uremia. Infantile polycystic kidney disease typically presents in newborns, has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, and is associated with hepatic cysts (microhamaomas) and congenital hepatic fibrosis. Grossly, these renal cysts have a radial spoke arrangement In two types of cystic renal disease, the cysts are limited to the medulla. Medullary sponge kidney is usually asymptomatic, is not familial, and is characterized by normal-sized kidneys with small cysts in the renal papillae. In medullary cystic disease complex (nephronophthisis), kidneys are small and sclerotic with multiple cysts at the coicomedullary junction. Individuals with this abnormality present in the first two decades of life with salt-wasting polyuria and progressive renal failure. Most cases are familial and display both recessive and dominant inheritance patterns. Two other types of cysts that are not limited to the medulla are simple cysts and acquired cysts. Simple coical cysts are single, unilateral cysts, found in adults, that are benign. Patients are usually asymptomatic, but they may present with microscopic hematuria. Acquired polycystic renal disease is associated with chronic renal dialysis. These kidneys are shrunken and have multiple cysts and an irregular surface.

However, a few factors associated with increased frequency of its development are chronic unopposed oestrogen excess, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and nulliparous state. There is irrefutable evidence of the relationship of endometrial carcinoma with prolonged oestrogenic stimulation. These evidence are as under 1. Endometrial carcinoma has an association with endometrial hyperplasia (discussed above) in which there are unopposed chronic hyperoestrogenism and frequent anovulatory cycles. 2. In postmenopausal years when endometrial carcinoma occurs characteristically, there is an excessive synthesis of oestrogen in the body from adrenal as well as from ovarian sources. 3. Women having oestrogen-secreting tumours (e. g. granulosa cell tumour) have increased risk of developing synchronous endometrial cancer. 4. Patients receiving prolonged exogenous oestrogen therapy are at higher risk of developing this cancer. 5. Women of breast cancer receiving tamoxifen for a prolonged period have 2-fold increased risk of developing uterine cancer. 6.

        "exp": ") The endometrium and myometrium are relatively resistant to infections. Therefore, inflammation of the endometrium (endometritis) is rare. The diagnosis of endometritis depends on finding inflammatory cells within the endometrium that are not present during the normal menstrual cycle. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) are normally present during menstruation, while a stromal lymphocytic infiltrate can be seen at other times during the menstrual cycle. Lymphoid aggregates and lymphoid follicles may also be seen in normal endometrium. Therefore the presence of any of these types of leukocytes is not diagnostic of endometritis. Acute endometritis is usually caused by bacterial infection following delivery or miscarriage and is characterized by the presence of neutrophils in endometrial tissue that is not menstrual endometrium. The histologic diagnosis of chronic endometritis depends on finding plasma cells within the endometrium. All it takes is one plasma cell to make the diagnosis. Chronic endometritis may be seen in patients with intrauterine devices (IUDs), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), retained products of conception (postpaum), or tuberculosis. The latter is characterized histologically by the presence of caseating granulomas with Langhans giant cells. These are secondary causes of chronic endometritis. In a significant number of cases, no underlying cause is found. Decidualized stromal cells are the result of the effects of progesterone and are seen normally in the late secretory phase or in patients who are pregnant.

Accidental exposure by contaminated water supply, house freshly coated with lead paint and sniffing of lead-containing petrol (hence unleaded petrol introduced as fuel). Lead is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract or lungs. The absorbed lead is distributed in two types of tissuesa) Bones, teeth, nails and hair representing a relatively harmless pool of lead. About 90% of absorbed lead accumulates in the developing metaphysis of bones in children and appears as areas of increased bone densities ('lead lines') on X-ray. Lead lines are also seen in the gingiva. b) Brain, liver, kidneys and bone marrow accumulate the remaining 10% lead which is directly toxic to these organs. It is excreted kidneys. Lead toxicity occurs in the following organs predominantly: 1. Nervous system: The changes are as under: In children, lead encephalopathy; edema of the brain, flattening of gyri and compression of ventricles. In adults, demyelinating peripheral motor neuropathy which typically affects radial and peroneal nerves resulting in wristdrop and footdrop respectively. 2.

Prominent basophilic stippling of erythrocytes. 3. Kidneys: Lead is toxic to proximal tubular cells of the kidney and produces lead nephropathy characterized by the accumulation of intranuclear inclusion bodies consisting of the lead-protein complex in the proximal tubular cells. 4.

Other diseases, such as gastritis, esophageal laceration (Mallory-Weiss tears), or peptic ulcer disease, may cause hematemesis In contrast, columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus is seen with Barrett's esophagus; decreased ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus are seen with achalasia, a disorder that is characterized by aperistalsis, incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) with swallowing, and increased resting tone of the LES, all of which lead to esophageal dilation and symptoms of progressive dysphagia.

Clinically, acute appendicitis causes right lower quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, a mild fever, and a leukocytosis in the peripheral blood. These symptoms may not occur in the very young or the elderly. The inflamed appendiceal wall may become gangrenous and perforate in 24 to 48 h. Even with classic symptoms, the appendix may be histologically unremarkable in up to 20% of the cases. False-positive diagnoses are to be preferred to the possible severe or fatal complications of a false-negative diagnosis of acute appendicitis that results in rupture. Lymphoid hyperplasia with multinucleated giant cells (Wahin-Finkeldey giant cells) is characteristic of measles (rubeola). These changes can be found in the appendix, but this is quite rare. Dilation of the lumen of the appendix, called a mucocele, may be caused by mucosal hyperplasia, a benign cystadenoma, or a malignant mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.

It is impoant to realize that the presence of neutrophils within the glandular epithelium indicates active inflammation and may be the main type of inflammation present (acute gastritis), or may be combined with more numerous chronic inflammations (active chronic gastritis). Chronic gastritis is divided into subgroups based either on etiology (immunologic or infectious), location (antrum or body), histopathology, or clinical features. H. pylori gastritis is associated with infection by H. pylori, a small, curved, gram-negative rod that is found in approximately 20% of the general population. The organisms are found in the mucus overlying the surface/foveolar epithelium. These changes tend to affect primarily the antral or antral-body-fundic mucosa. This is the type of gastritis normally associated with active chronic gastritis. The therapy for Helicobacter is either triple therapy (metronidazole, bismuth salicylate, and either amoxicillin or tetracycline) or double therapy (omeprazole and clarithromycin). In contrast, autoimmune gastritis, also known as diffuse corporal atrophic gastritis or type A atrophic gastritis, is characterized by the presence of autoimmune antibodies including parietal cell antibodies and intrinsic factor antibodies. This type of gastritis is associated with pernicious anemia and achlorhydria. Pernicious anemia is the result of decreased intrinsic factor, which in turn produces a vitamin B12 deficiency. This vitamin deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and subacute combined disease of the spinal cord. Histologically there is diffuse atrophy (reduced mucosal thickness), gland loss, widespread intestinal metaplasia, and variable chronic and acute inflammation. These changes are found predominately in the body-fundus mucosa (usually absent in the antrum). There is an increased risk for gastric cancer, but these patients do not develop peptic ulcers.

Elevation of the mean pulmonary aerial pressure is the result of endothelial dysfunction and vascular changes. The vascular changes vary with the size of the vessel. The main aeries have atheromas that are similar to systemic atherosclerosis, but are not as severe. Medium-sized aeries show intimal thickening and neomuscularization. Smaller aeries and aerioles show intimal thickening, medial hyperophy, and reduplication of the internal and external elastic membranes. A distinctive aeriolar change, a plexiform lesion, consists of intraluminal angiomatous tufts that form webs. This pattern is thought to be diagnostic of primary hypertension The changes of pulmonary vascular sclerosis may be primary or secondary. Primary pulmonary vascular sclerosis almost always occurs in young women, who develop fatigue, syncope (with exercise), dyspnea on exeion (DOE), and chest pain. Secondary sclerosis may occur at any age, and symptoms depend on the underlying cause. Possible causes include ceain types of heart disease, such as mitral valve disease, left ventricular failure, and congenital valvular disease with left-to-right shunt, as well as ceain types of pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive or interstitial lung disease and recurrent pulmonary emboli.

No increased cellularity or necrosis is noted in the abnormal glomeruli. Additionally, there is cystic dilation of the renal tubules, some of which are filled with proteinaceous material. Electron microscopy reveals focal fusion of podocytes, and immunofluorescence examination finds granular IgM/C3 deposits. What is the best diagnosis for this renal abnormality?",
        "exp": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a glomerular disorder that accounts for about 10% of the cases of nephrotic syndrome. FSGS, which affects children and adults, begins as a focal process, affecting only some glomeruli. In the earliest stage, only some of the juxtamedullary glomeruli show changes. Eventually, some glomeruli in other pas of the coex are affected. In the late stages of the disease, the process may become diffuse, affecting most or all glomeruli. Initially, the process is also segmental, involving some but not all of the lobules within an individual glomerular tuft. The involved area shows sclerosis and may show hyalinosis lesions. Eventually some glomeruli show sclerosis of the entire tuft (global sclerosis). Electron microscopy shows increased mesangial matrix and dense granular mesangial deposits. Immunofluorescence typically shows granular mesangial fluorescence for IgM and C3. Because of the focal nature of FSGS, early cases can be difficult to distinguish from minimal change disease (MCD). Clinically, the nephrotic syndrome of FSGS is more severe than that of minimal change disease and is nonselective. The process is much less responsive to steroids and is much more prone to progress to chronic renal failure. It tends to recur in transplanted kidneys. FSGS can be seen in the setting of AIDS nephropathy and heroin nephropathy. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",

Light Microscopy - cells from the base of the lesion, or wiped from a mucous surface, or biopsy material, may reveal intranuclear inclusions (Lipschutz inclusion bodies). Infected cells may show ballooning and fusion. 2. Electron Microscopy - Electron microscopy is not a sensitive tool for the detection of HSV, except in the case of vesicle fluids which often contain 108 or more paicles per milliliter. However, like light microscopy, electron microscopy cannot distinguish between the different viruses. 3. Direct examination by antigen detection - cells from specimens is treated in ice-cold acetone. FITC is generally used for staining of fixed material. It is more sensitive and specific than light and electron microscopy (90% sensitive, 90% specific), but cannot match virus culture. In terms of cost and technical expeise, it is very much more demanding. Cytopathic effect of HSV in cell culture, note the ballooning of cells (Couesy of Linda Stannard, University of Cape Town, S. A.) and positive immunofluorescence test for HSV antigen in the epithelial cell (Virology Laboratory, Yale-New Haven Hospital) Ref: mayo clinic",
