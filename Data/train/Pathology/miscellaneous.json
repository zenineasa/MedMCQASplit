        "exp": "Gastritis is a nonspecific term that describes any inflammation of the gastric mucosa. Acute gastritis refers to the clinical situation of gastric mucosal erosions (not mucosal ulcers). Acute gastritis is also known as hemorrhagic gastritis or acute erosive gastritis. Acute gastritis is associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and coicosteroids, and also with alcohol, chemotherapy, ischemia, shock, and even severe stress. Two types of stress ulcers are Curling's ulcers, seen in patients with severe burns, and Cushing's ulcers, seen in patients with intracranial lesions. Grossly acute gastritis appears as multiple, scattered, punctate (less than 1 cm) hemorrhagic areas in the gastric mucosa. This is helpful in differentiating acute gastritis from peptic ulcers, which tend to be solitary and larger. Microscopically the gastric mucosa from a patient with acute gastritis is likely to reveal mucosal erosions, scattered neutrophils, edema, and possibly hemorrhage. Acute gastritis. Erosion and complete effacement of the epithelium is observed. The residual glands, on the left, display regenerative changes with basophilic epithelium.

        "exp": "Symptoms not caused by either local or metastatic effects of tumors are called paraneoplastic syndromes. Bronchogenic carcinomas are associated with the development of many different types of paraneoplastic syndromes. These syndromes are usually associated with the secretion of ceain substances by the tumor cells. For example, ectopic secretion of ACTH may produce Cushing's syndrome, while ectopic secretion of antidiuretic hormone (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion) may produce hyponatremia. Hypocalcemia may result from the production of calcitonin, while hypercalcemia may result from the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is a normal substance produced locally by many different types of tissue. PTHrP is distinct from parathyroid hormone (PTH) patients with this type of paraneoplastic syndrome have increased calcium levels and decreased PTH levels. As a result of decreased PTH production, all of the parathyroid glands in these patients are atrophic. Other tumors associated with the production of PTHrP include clear cell carcinomas of the kidney, endometrial adenocarcinomas, and transitional carcinomas of the urinary bladder. Lung cancers are also associated with multiple, migratory venous thromboses. This migratory thrombophlebitis is called Trousseau's sign and is more classically associated with carcinoma of the pancreas. Hyperophic osteoahropathy is a syndrome consisting of periosteal new bone formation with or without digital clubbing and joint effusion. It is most commonly found in association with lung carcinoma, but it also occurs with other types of pulmonary disease. Erythrocytosis is associated with increased erythropoietin levels and some tumors, paicularly renal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and cerebellar hemangioblastomas.

        "exp": "The metabisulfite test is used to detect the presence of hemoglobin S, but it does not differentiate the heterozygous sickle cell trait from the homozygous sickle cell disease. The test is based on the fact that erythrocytes with a large propoion of hemoglobin S sickle in solutions of low oxygen content. Metabisulfite is a reducing substance that enhances the process of deoxygenation. The osmotic fragility test is a diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis. Spherocytes lyse at a higher concentration of salt than do normal cells, thus causing an increased osmotic fragility. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT), or Coombs' test, is used to differentiate autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) due to the presence of anti-red cell antibodies from other forms of hemolytic anemia. In this test, antibodies to human immunoglobulin cause the agglutination (clotting) of red cells if these anti-red cell antibodies are present on the surface of the red cells. In patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, the erythrocytes are excessively sensitive to complement-mediated lysis in low ionic environments (the basis for the sucrose hemolysis test) or in acidotic conditions, such as sleep, exercise, or the Ham's acid hemolysis test. The Schilling test, which measures intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 with and without intrinsic factor, is used to diagnose decreased vitamin B12 caused by pernicious anemia, which is characterized by a lack of intrinsic factor.

        "exp": "Germ cell tumors of the testis often secrete enzymes or polypeptide hormones, examples of which include a fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (h. CG). AFP is synthesized by the fetal gut, liver, and yolk sac. It may be secreted by either yolk sac tumors (endodermal sinus tumors) or embryonal carcinomas. AFP may also be secreted by liver cell carcinomas. b-h. CG is a glycoprotein that is normally synthesized by placental syncytiotrophoblasts. Markedly elevated serum levels are most often associated with choriocarcinomas, which are characterized histologically by a mixture of malignant cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Mildly elevated serum levels of b-h. CG may be found in patients with other types of germ cell tumors if they contain syncytiotrophoblast-like giant cells. This is found in about 10% of classic seminomas, which are characterized histologically by large cells with distinct cell membranes and clear cytoplasm. An impoant, distinct variant of seminoma is the spermatocytic seminoma. It is characterized by being found in older individuals and by the fact that it does not metastasize. Histologically, a spermatocytic seminoma is characterized by maturation of the tumor cells, some of which histologically resemble secondary spermatocytes. To summarize: markedly elevated levels of h. CG are associated with choriocarcinomas, while elevated levels of AFP are most characteristic of yolk sac tumors and embryonal carcinomas. But there are many areas of overlap between tumors, and many tumors are composed of multiple types of germ cell cancers. The only definitive statement that can be made is that elevated serum levels of AFP cannot be seen in a tumor that is a pure seminoma.

It results from a genetic deficiency of one of the enzymes required for the synthesis of haem, resulting in excessive production of porphyrins. Often, the genetic deficiency is precipitated by the intake of some drugs. Porphyrias are associated with excretion of intermediate products in the urine--delta-aminolaevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and protoporphyrin. Porphyrias are broadly of 2 types--erythropoietic and hepatic. (a) Erythropoietic porphyrias: These have a defective synthesis of haem in the red cell precursors in the bone marrow. These may be fuher of 2 subtypes: Congenital erythropoietic porphyria, in which the urine is red due to the presence of uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin. The skin of these infants is highly photosensitive. Bones and skin show red-brown discolouration. Erythropoietic protoporphyria, in which there is an excess of protoporphyrin but no excess of porphyrin in the urine. (b) Hepatic porphyrias. These are more common and have a normal erythroid precursor but have a defect in the synthesis of haem in the liver. Its fuher subtypes include the following: Acute intermittent porphyria is characterised by acute episodes of 3 patterns: abdominal, neurological, and psychotic.

        "exp": "Several pathologic conditions are associated with the formation of white plaques on the vulva, which are clinically referred to as leukoplakia. Lichen sclerosis is seen histologically as atrophy of the epidermis with underlying dermal fibrosis. This abnormality is seen in postmenopausal women, who develop pruritic white plaques of the vulva. It is not thought to be premalignant. Loss of pigment in the epidermis (vitiligo) can also produce leukoplakia. Inflammatory skin diseases, such as chronic dermal inflammation, squamous hyperplasia (characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis), and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (characterized by epithelial atypia or dysplasia), can also present with leukoplakia. A term related to leukoplakia is vulvar dystrophy, but this refers specifically to either lichen sclerosis or squamous hyperplasia. Because the latter is sometimes associated with epithelial dysplasia, it is also referred to as hyperplastic dystrophy. It is most commonly seen in postmenopausal women. The male counterpa of lichen sclerosis, called balanitis xerotica obliterans, is found on the penis. Paget's disease is a malignant tumor that can be found in the breast or the vulva. The latter is seen clinically as pruritic, red, crusted, sharply demarcated maplike areas.

A biopsy from one of these enlarged lymph nodes reveals a proliferation of reactive T immunoblasts, cells that have prominent nucleoli. These reactive T cells are most likely to be found in which one of the following regions of the lymph node?",
        "exp": "Lymph nodes may be enlarged (lymphadenopathy) secondary to reactive processes, which can be either acute or chronic. Acute reaction (acute nonspecific lymphadenitis) can result in focal or generalized lymphadenopathy. Focal lymph node enlargement is usually the result of bacterial infection. Sections from involved lymph nodes reveal infiltration by neutrophils. In contrast, generalized acute lymphadenopathy is usually the result of viral infections and usually produces a proliferation of reactive T lymphocytes called T immunoblasts. These reactive T cells tend to have prominent nucleoli and can be easily mistaken for malignant lymphocytes or malignant Hodgkin cells. Reactive processes involving lymph nodes typically involve different and specific poions of the lymph nodes depending upon the type of cell that is reacting. For example, reactive B lymphocytes typically result in hyperplasia of the lymphoid follicles and germinal centers (follicular hyperplasia). Examples of diseases that are associated with follicular hyperplasia include chronic inflammation caused by organisms, rheumatoid ahritis, and AIDS. Lymph nodes from patients with AIDS undergo characteristic changes that begin with follicular hyperplasia with loss of mantle zones, intrafollicular hemorrhage (\"follicle lysis\"), and monocytoid B cell proliferation. Subsequently there is depletion of lymphocytes (CD4+ lymphocytes) in both the follicles and the interfollicular areas. In contrast to reactive B cell processes, reactive T lymphocytes typically result in hyperplasia involving the T cell areas of the lymph node, namely the interfollicular regions and the paracoex. Examples of clinical situations associated with a T lymphocyte response include viral infections, vaccinations, use of some drugs (paicularly Dilantin), and systemic lupus erythematosus. The sinusoidal pattern of reaction involves expansion of the sinuses by benign macrophages, as seen in reactive proliferations of the mononuclearphagocytic system.

        "exp": "Fibrocystic change of the breast is one of the most common features seen in the female breast. It is most likely associated with an endocrine imbalance that causes an abnormality of the normal monthly cyclic events within the breast. These fibrocystic changes are subdivided into nonproliferative and proliferative changes. Nonproliferative changes include fibrosis of the stroma and cystic dilation of the terminal ducts, which when large may form blue-domed cysts. A common feature of the ducts in nonproliferative changes is apocrine metaplasia, which refers to epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with apical snouts. Proliferative changes include epithelial hyperplasia of the ducts. This hyperplastic epithelium may form papillary structures (papillomatosis when pronounced), or may be quite abnormal (atypical hyperplasia). Two benign, but clinically impoant, forms of proliferative fibrocystic change include sclerosing adenosis and radial scar. Both of these may be mistaken histologically for infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but the presence of myoepithelial cells is a helpful sign that points to the benign nature of the proliferation. Sclerosing adenosis is a disease of the terminal lobules that is typically seen in patients 35 to 45 years old. It produces a firm mass, most often located in the upper outer quadrant. Microscopically there is florid proliferation of small ductal structures in a fibrous stroma, which on low power is stellate in appearance and somewhat maintains the normal lobular architecture.

Therefore, before the diagnosis of sarcoidosis can be made, cultures must be taken from affected tissues, and there must be no growth of any organism that may produce granulomas. In patients with sarcoidosis, blood levels of angiotensin-conveing enzyme are increased, and this may also be used as a clinical test. In the past, the Kveim skin test was used to assist in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, but since it involves injecting into patients extracts of material from humans, it is no longer used Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",

        "exp": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal stem cell disorder that is characterized by abnormal red cells, granulocytes, and platelets. The red blood cells (RBCs) are abnormally sensitive to the lytic activity of complement due to a deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) linked proteins, namely decay-accelerating factor (DAF, or CD 55), membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (CD55), or CD59 (a C8 binding protein). Complement is normally activated by acidotic states, such as occur with exercise or sleep. In patients with PNH, the acidotic condition that develops during sleep (which is usually at night) causes hemolysis of red blood cells and results in red urine in the morning. The erythrocytes of these patients lyse in vitro with acid (Ham's test) or sucrose (sucrose lysis test). Complications of PNH include the development of frequent thromboses, paicularly of the hepatic, poal, or cerebral veins. Since PNH is a clonal stem cell disorder, patients are at an increased risk of developing aplastic anemia or acute leukemia. The autoimmune hemolytic anemias are impoant causes of acute anemia in a wide variety of clinical states and can be separated into two main types: those secondary to \"warm\" antibodies and those reactive at cold temperatures. Warm-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemias react at 37degC in vitro, are composed of IgG, and do not fix complement. They are found in patients with malignant tumors, especially leukemia-lymphoma; with use of such drugs as a-methyldopa; and in the autoimmune diseases, especially lupus erythematosus. Cold-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia reacts at 4 to 6degC, fixes complement, is of the IgM type, and is classically associated with Mycoplasma pneumonitis (pleuropneumonia-like organisms). These antibodies are termed cold agglutinins and may reach extremely high titers and cause intravascular red cell agglutination. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",

Despite their cancer-causing propeies, gamma rays are also used to treat some types of cancer, since the rays also kill cancer cells. In the procedure called gamma-knife surgery, multiple concentrated beams of gamma rays are directed to the growth in order to kill the cancerous cells. The beams are aimed from different angles to concentrate the radiation on the growth while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues.",

Numerous clinical examples exist of a serum sickness-like nephritis as a consequence of systemic infection, with classic clinical models such as syphilis, hepatitis B, malaria, and bacterial endocarditis leading to renal disease. Immune complexes to antigens from any of these sources are circulating within the vascular system and become entrapped within the filtration system of the glomerular basement membranes. This can be seen as granular, bumpy deposits by immunofluorescence within the basement membranes of the glomeruli. Linear fluorescence, on the other hand, is seen in primary antiglomerular basement membrane disease, in which antibodies are directed against the glomerular basement membrane itself. Plasma cell interstitial nephritis is seen in immunologic rejection of transplanted kidneys. Nodular glomerulosclerosis is an effect of diabetes mellitus. The presence of red blood cell casts in the urine nearly always indicates that there has been glomerular injury but is not specific for any given cause. Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane caused by subepithelial immune deposits is seen in membranous glomerulonephritis. While the morphology of membranous glomerulonephritis is different from that of nephritis caused by circulating antigen-antibody complexes (immune complexes), there are similarities in the pathogenesis in that both disorders may be a consequence of or exist in association with infections such as hepatitis B, syphilis, or malaria. Other causes of membranous glomerulonephritis include reactions to penicillamine and gold, and ceain malignancies such as malignant melanoma.

It is equally common in men and women. There are 3 distinctive features which distinguish medullary carcinoma from the other thyroid carcinomas. They are: its familial occurrence, secretion of calcitonin and other peptides, and amyloid stroma. 1. Familial occurrence. Most cases of medullary carcinoma occur sporadically, but about 10% have a genetic background with point mutation in RET-protooncogene located on chromosome 10q. The familial form of medullary carcinoma in association with pheochromocytoma and parathyroid adenoma (multiple endocrine neoplasias, MEN II A), or with pheochromocytoma and multiple mucosal neuromas (MEN II B). 2. Secretion of calcitonin and other peptides. Like normal C-cells, tumour cells of medullary carcinoma secrete calcitonin, the hypocalcaemic hormone. In addition, the tumour may also elaborate prostaglandins, histaminase, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and ACTH. These hormone elaborations are responsible for a number of clinical syndromes such as carcinoid syndrome, Cushing's syndrome and diarrhoea. 3. Amyloid stroma. Most medullary carcinomas have amyloid deposits in the stroma which stains positively with usual amyloid stains such as Congo red. The amyloid deposits are believed to represent stored calcitonin derived from neoplastic C-cells in the form of prohormone. Most cases of medullary carcinoma present as solitary thyroid nodule but sometimes an enlarged cervical lymph node may be the first manifestation. Most medullary carcinomas are slow-growing. Regional lymph node metastases may occur but distant organ metastases are infrequent. The prognosis is better in familial form than in the sporadic form: overall 10-year survival rate is 60-70%.

        "exp": "The differential diagnosis of microcytosis includes b thalassemia (due to a defect in globin chain synthesis) and iron-deficiency anemia. It is impoant to distinguish between these two disorders because therapy with iron benefits patients with iron-deficiency anemia, but harms patients with thalassemia because these patients are at risk for iron overload. Both thalassemia minor and iron-deficiency anemia are microcytic disorders in which the mean corpuscular hemoglobin is usually found to be reduced. Red blood cell indexes may be useful in differentiating the two disorders because, while the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is often normal or only slightly reduced in association with thalassemia minor, the MCHC is often definitely reduced in association with iron-deficiency anemia. (Both pernicious and folate-deficiency anemias lead to megaloblastic changes in erythrocytes.) The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of variation in the size of the red cells (anisocytosis). The RDW is increased in patients with iron-deficiency anemia, but is normal in patients with b thalassemia. Also unique to the microcytic anemias is the fact that patients with b thalassemia have increased red blood cell counts, while patients with all of the other microcytic anemias have decreased red blood cell counts. This increased red cell count in b thalassemia may be due to the increased hemoglobin F, which shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. This in turn causes an increased release of erythropoietin. Unlike iron-deficiency anemia, b thalassemia begins as a microcytic anemia. In contrast, irondeficiency anemia progresses through several stages. First there is decreased storage iron, which is followed by decreased circulating iron. At this time patients are still not clinically anemic. Next patients develop a normocytic normochromic anemia that transforms into a microcytic normochromic anemia and finally a microcytic hypochromic anemia.

        "question": "A 46-year-old woman undergoes an abdominal hysterectomy for a \"fibroid\" uterus. The surgeon requests a frozen section on the tumor, which is deferred because of the lesion's degree of cellularity. Which of the following criteria will be used by the pathologist in determining benignancy versus malignancy in permanent sections?",
        "exp": "\"Fibroids\" of the uterus are among the most common abnormalities seen in uteri. They arise in the myometrium, submucosally, subserosally, and midwall, both singly and several at a time. Sharply circumscribed, they are benign smooth-muscle tumors that are firm, gray-white, and whorled on cut section. Their malignant counterpa, leiomyosarcoma of the uterus, is quite rare in the de novo state and arises even more rarely from an antecedent leiomyoma. Whereas cell pleomorphism, tissue necrosis, and cytologic atypia per se are established criteria in assessing malignancy in tumors generally, they are impoant to the pathologist in uterine fibroids only if mitoses are also present. Regardless of cellularity or atypicality, if 10 or more mitoses are present in 10 separate high-power microscopic fields, the lesion is a leiomyosarcoma. If five or fewer mitoses are present in 10 fields with bland morphology, the leiomyoma will behave in a benign fashion. Problems arise when the mitotic counts range between three and seven per 10 fields with varying degrees of cell and tissue atypicality. These equivocal lesions should be regarded by both pathologist and clinician as \"gray-area\" smooth-muscle tumors of unpredictable biologic behavior. Founately, the gray-area leiomyoma of the uterus is rarely seen. Thus mitoses are the most impoant criteria in assessing malignancy in smooth-muscle tumors of the uterus.

The infection is transmitted through vaginal or anal intercourse and by autoinoculation. Initially, the lesion is in the form of a papule, a subcutaneous nodule or an ulcer. Within a few weeks, it develops into a raised, soft, painless, reddish ulcer with exuberant granulation tissue. Depending upon whether the individual is heterosexual or homosexual, the lesions are located on the penis, scrotum, genito-crural folds and inguinal folds, or in the perianal and anal area respectively. Regional lymphadenopathy generally does not occur. Microscopically, the margin of the ulcer shows epithelial hyperplasia. The ulcer bed shows neutrophilic abscesses. The dermis and subcutaneous tissues are infiltrated by numerous histiocytes containing many bacteria called Donovan bodies, and lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils.

Chronic rejection is dominated by vascular changes, interstitial fibrosis, and loss of renal parenchyma; there are typically only mild or no ongoing cellular parenchymal infiltrates. The vascular changes occur predominantly in the aeries and aerioles, which exhibit intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. These lesions ultimately compromise vascular perfusion and result in renal ischemia manifested by loss or hyalinization of glomeruli, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. The vascular lesion may be caused by cytokines released by activated T cells that act on the cells of the vascular wall, and it may be the end stage of the proliferative aeritis described earlier.

These effects causemitochondrial injury and decreased activity of mitochondrial enzymes in the liver. This eventually leads to rising in blood ammonia and accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes. The patients are generally children between 6 months and 15 years of age. Within a week after a viral illness, the childdevelops intractable vomiting and progressive neurological deterioration due to encephalopathy, eventually leading tostupor, coma, and death. Characteristic laboratory findings are elevated blood ammonia, serum transaminases, bilirubinand prolonged prothrombin time. Microscopically, hepatocytes show small droplets ofneutral fat in their cytoplasm (microvesicular fat).

Most tumors occur in adults and have a slight female predominance. Approximately 75 to 85% occur in the parotids, 10 to 20% in the submandibular glands, and the remainder in the minor glands. In the parotid the vast majority are benign, whereas in the minor glands 35 to 50% are malignant. Clinically, most tumors of the salivary glands present as palpable masses, regardless of histologic type. The most common neoplasm of the parotid gland is the pleomorphic adenoma (mixed tumor), which histologically reveals epithelial structures embedded within a mesenchyme-like stroma consisting of mucoid, myxoid, or chondroid tissue. A malignant tumor may develop from a pleomorphic adenoma, in which case it is called a carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. The second most common tumor is Wahin's tumor (papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum), which histologically reveals cleftlike spaces lined by oncocytic epithelial cells overlying a stroma with a dense lymphocytic infiltrate. The epithelial cells are oncocytic because their pink cytoplasm is packed with mitochondria Three malignant tumors of the salivary glands are mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and acinic cell carcinoma. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas consist of a mixture of squamous epithelial cells and mucus-secreting cells. The mucus-secreting cells of a mucoepidermoid carcinoma can demonstrate intracellular mucin with a special mucicarmine stain. Adenoid cystic carcinomas form tubular or cribriform patterns histologically and have a tendency to invade along perineural spaces, especially the facial nerve.

Male infants with Bruton's disease begin having trouble with recurrent bacterial infections at about the age of 9 months, which is when maternal antibodies are no longer present in the affected infant. Therapy for Bruton's disease consists primarily of IV gamma globulin. Isolated deficiency of IgA is probably the most common form of immunodeficiency. It is due to a block in the terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes. Most patients are asymptomatic, but some develop chronic sinopulmonary infections. Patients are prone to developing diarrhea (Giardia infection) and also have an increased incidence of autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Pulmonary edema can be classified based on the etiology into cardiogenic pulmonary edema and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema results from abnormalities of hemodynamic (Starling) forces, while noncardiogenic pulmonary edema results from cellular injury. Causes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema include increased hydrostatic forces, as seen with congestive heart failure (the most common cause of pulmonary edema); decreased oncotic pressure, such as resulting from decreased albumin levels; and lymphatic obstruction. Noncardiogenic edema may be the result of either endothelial injury (infections, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, or trauma) or alveolar injury (from inhaled toxins, aspiration, drowning, or near drowning). Microscopically, pulmonary edema reveals the alveoli to be filled with pale pink fluid. Cardiogenic edema may lead to alveolar hemorrhages and hemosiderin-laden macrophages (heart failure cells). Where cardiogenic edema is present, chest x-rays show an increase in the caliber of the blood vessels in the upper lobes, perivascular and peribronchial fluid (\"cuffing\"), and Kerley B lines (fluid in the interlobular septa).

Pathologists do agree, however, on the existence of a rare type of benign lesion called an inveed papilloma, which is characterized by nodular mucosal lesions that histologically have an endophytic growth pattern. Malignant neoplasms of the bladder may be transitional cell carcinomas, which are by far the most common type of tumor of the urinary bladder; squamous cell carcinomas, which produce keratin; or adenocarcinomas, which form glandular structures. TCCs may be either papillary or flat lesions. Papillary TCCs, which are the most common type of bladder cancer, may be either invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasive papillary TCCs are not referred to as being in situ, as that term implies a noninvasive, nonpapillary lesion. Nonpapillary (flat) TCCs may also be invasive (into the lamina propria or muscularis) or noninvasive (in situ). In contrast, squamous cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder are quite rare except in Egypt and other areas of the Middle East, where they are associated with schistosomiasis. Similarly, adenocarcinomas of the urinary bladder are quite rare, except that they may be associated with urachal epithelial remnants located in the dome of the bladder, glandular metaplasia, or cystitis glandularis.

Drugs such as acetaminophen may be metabolized in zone 1 to toxic compounds that cause necrosis of zone 3 hepatocytes because they receive the blood from zone 1. Midzonal necrosis - quite rare, but may be seen in yellow fever. Peripoal necrosis - is seen in phosphorus poisoning or eclampsia. Submassive necrosis refers to liver cell necrosis that crosses the normal lobular boundaries. Focal scattered necrosis: Characteristic of viral hepatitis It can also be seen with bacterial infections or other toxic insults. There is necrosis of small clusters of hepatocytes, that is located in some of the liver lobules.

If the peripheral neutropenia is the result of antineutrophil antibodies being produced in response to taking the sulfonamide, then this patient would be expected to have",
        "exp": "Decreased numbers of neutrophils in the peripheral blood (neutropenia) may be due to decreased production of neutrophils in the bone marrow or to increased peripheral destruction of neutrophils. Decreased production may be caused by megaloblastic anemia, ceain drugs, or stem cell defects such as aplastic anemia, leukemias, or lymphomas. Drug-induced destruction of neutrophil precursors is the most common cause of peripheral neutropenia. With all of these different causes of decreased neutrophil production, the bone marrow is hypoplastic and there is a decrease in the number of granulocytic precursors. Some causes of neutropenia also cause a decrease in the numbers of platelets and erythrocytes (pancytopenia). In contrast to decreased production, neutropenia secondary to peripheral destruction causes a hyperplasia of the bone marrow, with an increase in the number of granulocytic precursors. Causes of increased destruction of neutrophils include sequestration in the spleen due to hypersplenism (not splenic atrophy), increased utilization, such as with overwhelming infections, and immunologically mediated destruction (immune destruction). Causes of immune destruction include Felty's syndrome and ceain drug reactions, such as to aminopyrine and some sulfonamides. Drugs may cause decreased production or increased destruction of neutrophils. In the latter, antibodies are formed against neutrophils, and then these cells are destroyed peripherally. Felty's syndrome refers to the combination of rheumatoid ahritis, splenomegaly, and neutropenia. A significant number of patients with Felty's syndrome have a monoclonal proliferation of CD8 large granular lymphocytes, unrelated to drug use.

The erythrocytes are mainly normochromic and normocytic, and teardrop RBCs are not found. There are however, about two nucleated red blood cells per 100 white cells. What is the best diagnosis for this patient's anemia?",
        "exp": "Myelophthisic anemia results from space-occupying lesions of the bone marrow, such as granulomas or metastatic carcinomas. It is characterized by the presence of leukoerythroblastosis in the peripheral blood. This term refers to finding in the peripheral blood immature white cells, such as myelocytes and metamyelocytes, and immature red blood cells, such as nucleated red blood cells. Metastatic disease in the bone can produce localized bone pain and elevation of alkaline phosphatase that is associated with a normal g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level. In contrast, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia refers to mechanical destruction (hemolysis) of red cells caused by narrowing within the microvasculature and is seen in patients with prosthetic heart valves or severe calcific aoic stenosis, or in patients having disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, or hemolyticuremic syndrome. In addition to microangiopathic HA, other causes of IV mechanical destruction of red cells include march hemoglobinuria and ceain types of infections, such as baonellosis and malaria. Aplastic anemia is a stem cell disorder of the bone marrow that causes a marked decrease in the production of marrow cells that results in extreme marrow hypoplasia. Patients present with symptoms related to pancytopenia (anemia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia). Because their bone marrow cannot respond normally, patients with aplastic anemia have no increased reticulocytes in the peripheral blood (no polychromasia). Aplastic anemia may be inherited (Fanconi's anemia) or acquired. The most common cause of aplastic anemia is drugs. Other causes include chemicals (benzene and glue sniffing), radiation, and ceain types of infections, such as hepatitis C.

        "exp": "Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is similar to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in that it produces a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, but it is distinguished from TTP by the lack of neurologic symptoms and by the severe acute renal failure, which is manifested clinically by a markedly increased serum BUN. Classic HUS is seen in children and is related to infection, usually acquired from contaminated ground meat, by verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli. This toxin is similar to Shigella toxins, which, together with E. coli and viruses, are causes of the adult form of HUS. Multiple microthrombi in glomerular capillaries result in renal failure, while systemically the microthrombi cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Subsequently thrombocytopenia develops and leads to a bleeding diathesis, seen as vomiting of blood and hematuria. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is separated from these two thrombotic microangiopathic syndromes by its excessive activation of the clotting system, which results in increased fibrin degradation products (FDP or FSP) and prolonged clotting times (PT and PTT) due to depletion of coagulation factors.

Abnormalities of platelet aggregation (aggregation defects or primary wave defects) include Glanzmann's thrombasthenia and afibrinogenemia.

What is the mode of inheritance of this renal abnormality?",
        "exp": ") Cystic diseases of the kidney, which may be congenital, acquired, or inherited, have characteristic gross appearances. In two types of cystic renal disease, the numerous cysts are found in both the coex and medulla. These two types of polycystic disease of the kidney are the infantile type and the adult type. Adult polycystic kidney disease typically presents in adulthood and has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Histologically, the cysts are lined by tubular epithelium, while the stroma between the cysts is normal. Adult polycystic renal disease is associated with liver cysts and berry aneurysms, which may rupture and cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage. About one-half of patients with adult polycystic renal disease eventually develop uremia. Infantile polycystic kidney disease typically presents in newborns, has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, and is associated with hepatic cysts (microhamaomas) and congenital hepatic fibrosis. Grossly, these renal cysts have a radial spoke arrangement In two types of cystic renal disease, the cysts are limited to the medulla. Medullary sponge kidney is usually asymptomatic, is not familial, and is characterized by normal-sized kidneys with small cysts in the renal papillae. In medullary cystic disease complex (nephronophthisis), kidneys are small and sclerotic with multiple cysts at the coicomedullary junction. Individuals with this abnormality present in the first two decades of life with salt-wasting polyuria and progressive renal failure. Most cases are familial and display both recessive and dominant inheritance patterns. Two other types of cysts that are not limited to the medulla are simple cysts and acquired cysts. Simple coical cysts are single, unilateral cysts, found in adults, that are benign. Patients are usually asymptomatic, but they may present with microscopic hematuria. Acquired polycystic renal disease is associated with chronic renal dialysis. These kidneys are shrunken and have multiple cysts and an irregular surface.

Endometrial carcinoma has an association with endometrial hyperplasia (discussed above) in which there are unopposed chronic hyperoestrogenism and frequent anovulatory cycles. 2. In postmenopausal years when endometrial carcinoma occurs characteristically, there is an excessive synthesis of oestrogen in the body from adrenal as well as from ovarian sources. 3. Women having oestrogen-secreting tumours (e. g. granulosa cell tumour) have increased risk of developing synchronous endometrial cancer. 4. Patients receiving prolonged exogenous oestrogen therapy are at higher risk of developing this cancer. 5. Women of breast cancer receiving tamoxifen for a prolonged period have 2-fold increased risk of developing uterine cancer. 6. Prolonged administration of oestrogen to laboratory animals can produce endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. 7. Women with gonadal agenesis rarely develop endometrial carcinoma.

The pathology repo from this specimen makes the diagnosis of chronic endometritis. Based on this pathology repo, which one of the following was present in the biopsy sample of the endometrium?",
        "exp": ") The endometrium and myometrium are relatively resistant to infections. Therefore, inflammation of the endometrium (endometritis) is rare. The diagnosis of endometritis depends on finding inflammatory cells within the endometrium that are not present during the normal menstrual cycle. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) are normally present during menstruation, while a stromal lymphocytic infiltrate can be seen at other times during the menstrual cycle. Lymphoid aggregates and lymphoid follicles may also be seen in normal endometrium. Therefore the presence of any of these types of leukocytes is not diagnostic of endometritis. Acute endometritis is usually caused by bacterial infection following delivery or miscarriage and is characterized by the presence of neutrophils in endometrial tissue that is not menstrual endometrium. The histologic diagnosis of chronic endometritis depends on finding plasma cells within the endometrium. All it takes is one plasma cell to make the diagnosis. Chronic endometritis may be seen in patients with intrauterine devices (IUDs), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), retained products of conception (postpaum), or tuberculosis. The latter is characterized histologically by the presence of caseating granulomas with Langhans giant cells. These are secondary causes of chronic endometritis. In a significant number of cases, no underlying cause is found. Decidualized stromal cells are the result of the effects of progesterone and are seen normally in the late secretory phase or in patients who are pregnant. Histologically, these stromal cells contain abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",

In children, the following are the main sources of lead poisoning: Chewing of lead-containing furniture items, toys or pencils. Eating of lead paint flakes from walls. In adults, the sources are as follows: Occupational exposure to lead during spray painting, recycling of automobile batteries (lead oxide fumes), mining, and extraction of lead. Accidental exposure by contaminated water supply, house freshly coated with lead paint and sniffing of lead-containing petrol (hence unleaded petrol introduced as fuel). Lead is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract or lungs. The absorbed lead is distributed in two types of tissuesa) Bones, teeth, nails and hair representing a relatively harmless pool of lead. About 90% of absorbed lead accumulates in the developing metaphysis of bones in children and appears as areas of increased bone densities ('lead lines') on X-ray. Lead lines are also seen in the gingiva. b) Brain, liver, kidneys and bone marrow accumulate the remaining 10% lead which is directly toxic to these organs. It is excreted kidneys. Lead toxicity occurs in the following organs predominantly: 1. Nervous system: The changes are as under: In children, lead encephalopathy; edema of the brain, flattening of gyri and compression of ventricles. In adults, demyelinating peripheral motor neuropathy which typically affects radial and peroneal nerves resulting in wristdrop and footdrop respectively. 2. Hematopoietic system: The changes in the blood are quite characteristic: Microcytic hypochromic anemia due to inhibition of two enzymes: delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydrogenase required for haem synthesis, and through inhibition of ferroketolase required for incorporation of ferrous iron into the porphyrinring. Prominent basophilic stippling of erythrocytes. 3. Kidneys: Lead is toxic to proximal tubular cells of the kidney and produces lead nephropathy characterized by the accumulation of intranuclear inclusion bodies consisting of the lead-protein complex in the proximal tubular cells. 4.

The cirrhosis causes poal hypertension, which shunts blood into connecting channels between the poal and caval systems, such as the subepithelial plexus of veins in the lower esophagus.

Other diseases, such as gastritis, esophageal laceration (Mallory-Weiss tears), or peptic ulcer disease, may cause hematemesis In contrast, columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus is seen with Barrett's esophagus; decreased ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus are seen with achalasia, a disorder that is characterized by aperistalsis, incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) with swallowing, and increased resting tone of the LES, all of which lead to esophageal dilation and symptoms of progressive dysphagia.

Elevation of the mean pulmonary aerial pressure is the result of endothelial dysfunction and vascular changes. The vascular changes vary with the size of the vessel. The main aeries have atheromas that are similar to systemic atherosclerosis, but are not as severe. Medium-sized aeries show intimal thickening and neomuscularization. Smaller aeries and aerioles show intimal thickening, medial hyperophy, and reduplication of the internal and external elastic membranes. A distinctive aeriolar change, a plexiform lesion, consists of intraluminal angiomatous tufts that form webs. This pattern is thought to be diagnostic of primary hypertension The changes of pulmonary vascular sclerosis may be primary or secondary. Primary pulmonary vascular sclerosis almost always occurs in young women, who develop fatigue, syncope (with exercise), dyspnea on exeion (DOE), and chest pain. Secondary sclerosis may occur at any age, and symptoms depend on the underlying cause. Possible causes include ceain types of heart disease, such as mitral valve disease, left ventricular failure, and congenital valvular disease with left-to-right shunt, as well as ceain types of pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive or interstitial lung disease and recurrent pulmonary emboli.
