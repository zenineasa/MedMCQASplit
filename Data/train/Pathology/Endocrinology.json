The risk of thyroid cancer following irradiation is related to radiation dose and age (greater for children exposed early in life), and the risk persists throughout life. Radiation exposure during childhood also increases the risk of benign thyroid nodules and hypothyroidism. The purpose of this topic is to review the evaluation of a patient with a history of childhood radiation exposure and how such a history affects treatment of patients with thyroid tumors. Radiation injury to other organs is reviewed separately. (See and.) RADIATION EXPOSURE Type of exposure -- Radiation exposure may be external or internal. *External - The predominant types of external radiation are diagnostic radiographs, therapeutic radiation for the treatment of cancer, and historical use of external radiation to treat a wide variety of nonmalignant conditions. External radiation also includes brachytherapy, whereby a sealed radiation source is placed adjacent to a treatment area. *Internal - Internal radiation exposure includes ingestion of foods or liquids contaminated with radioactivity or by inhalation of radioactive gases or paicles. Internal radiation occurs after exposure to nuclear fallout (from testing and accidents at operating nuclear power plants or above ground nuclear explosive testing) or after ingestion of radioiodine for diagnostic tests and for therapy of hypehyroidism.",

        "question": "A perimenopausal woman presents with increasing swallowing difficulty and fatigue. Physical examination reveals that her thyroid is enlarged (palpable goiter). Laboratory examination of her serum reveals T4 of 4. 9 mg/dL, free T4 of 2. 5 ng/dL, and TSH of 5. 5 m. IU/mL. No thyroidstimulating immunoglobulins are identified in the serum, but antimicrosomal antibodies are present. Which one of the listed histologic findings, if present in a thyroid biopsy from this individual, would be most consistent with a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis?",
        "exp": "Four types of thyroiditis may be associated with hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, one of the autoimmune thyroid diseases, is associated with the HLA-B8 haplotype and high titers of circulating autoantibodies, including antimicrosomal, antithyroglobulin, and anti-TSH receptor antibodies. This abnormality is not uncommon in the United States. Histologically, there is infiltration of the thyroid stroma by an intense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, with the formation of lymphoid follicles and germinal centers. This produces destruction and atrophy of the follicles and transforms the thyroid follicular cells into acidophilic cells. There are many different names for these cells, including oxyphilic cells, oncocytes, Huhle cells, and Askanazy cells. Not uncommonly, patients develop hypothyroidism as a result of follicle disruption, and the manifestations consist of fatigue, myxedema, cold intolerance, hair coarsening, and constipation. Rarely, cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis may develop hypehyroidism (Hashitoxicosis), while the combination of Hashimoto's disease, pernicious anemia, and type I diabetes mellitus is called Schmidt's syndrome. This is one type of multiglandular syndrome. Although subacute thyroiditis and Riedel's thyroiditis may have similar symptoms to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, biopsy findings in these disorders are distinctly different. Subacute (de Quervain's, granulomatous, or giant cell) thyroiditis is a self-limited viral infection of the thyroid. It typically follows an upper respiratory tract infection. Patients develop the acute onset of fever and painful thyroid enlargement, and may develop a transient hypothyroidism. Histologically there is destruction of the follicles with a granulomatous reaction and multinucleated giant cells that surround fragments of colloid. One-half of patients with Riedel's thyroiditis are hypothyroid, but, in contrast to the other types of thyroiditis, microscopic examination reveals dense fibrosis of the thyroid gland, often extending into extrathyroidal soft tissue. This fibrosis produces a rock-hard enlarged thyroid gland that may produce the feeling of suffocation. This combination of signs and symptoms may be mistaken clinically for a malignant process. Additionally, these patients may develop similar fibrosis in the mediastinum or retroperitoneum. Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis is also a self-limited, painless enlargement of the thyroid that is associated with hypothyroidism, but that lacks antithyroid antibodies or lymphoid germinal centers within the thyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",

We prospectively studied 138 Chinese GBS patients and found that IgG anti-GD1a antibodies were closely associated with AMAN but not AIDP. With a cutoff titer of greater than 1: 100, 60% of AMAN versus 4% of AIDP patients had IgG anti-GD1a antibodies; with a cutoff titer of greater than 1: 1, 000, 24% of AMAN patients and none of the AIDP patients had IgG anti-GD1a antibodies. In contrast, low levels of IgG anti-GM1 antibodies (> 1: 100) were detected in both the AMAN and the AIDP forms (57% vs 35%, NS). High titers of IgG anti-GM1 (>1: 1, 000) were more common in the AMAN form (24% vs 8%, NS). Serological evidence of recent Campylobacter infection was detected in 81% of AMAN and 50% of AIDP patients, and anti-ganglioside antibodies were common in both Campylobacter-infected and noninfected patients.
