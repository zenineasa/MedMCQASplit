Milk alkali syndrome Metastasis (Multiple myeloma) Myositis ossificans: It's a type of connective tissue metaplasia. It is seen after a traumatic injury.

At autopsy, hepatocytes are noted to contain golden cytoplasmic granules that do not stain with Prussian blue. Which of the following best accounts for pigment accumulation in the liver of this patient?",
        "exp": "The answer is A: Advanced age. Substances that cannot be metabolized accumulate in cells. Examples include:- (1) endogenous substrates that are not processed because a key enzyme is missing (lysosomal storage diseases) (2) insoluble endogenous pigments (lipofuscin and melanin) (3) exogenous paiculates (silica and carbon) Lipofuscin is a \"wear and tear\" pigment of aging that accumulates in organs such as the brain, heart, and liver.
