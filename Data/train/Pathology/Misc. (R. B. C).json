About DMT-1: Mucosal uptake of non-heme iron begins at brush border of mucosal cell, mediated by divalent metal ion transporter 1 (DMT1, also known as Nramp2, SLC11. A2). Levels of DMT1 are markedly increased in iron-deficient animals. In addition to iron, DMT I has been shown to transport a variety of divalent metal ions, including Mn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+. (Hence non -specific). It acts as a proton symporter; protons accompany metal ions into the cell.

        "exp": "Ans. (d) Lithium heparin(Ref: Henry Clinical chemistry). Heparin, a mucoitin polysulfuric acid, is an effective anticoagulant available as lithium heparin (Li. Hep) and sodium heparin (Na. Hep) in green-top tubes. Heparin accelerates the action of antithrombin III, neutralizing thrombin and preventing the formation of fibrin. Heparin has an advantage over EDTA as an anticoagulant, as it does not affect levels of ions such as calcium. However, heparin can interfere with some immunoassays. Heparin should not be used for coagulation or hematology testing.",

Mix 1 ml of 1% sodium hydroxide with 4 ml supernatant and observe color change after 2 minutes.#Remains pink: Hemoglobin F#Turns yellow-brown: Hemoglobin A (maternal blood)A common approach to evaluating FMH is the rosette test to screen for the presence of fetal cells followed by the Kleihauer-Betke acid elution method to quantify the magnitude of feto-maternal bleed. The Kleihauer-Betke acid elution method: Quantitative estimate of the volume of FMH based on different solubility properties of HbF&HbA. On a peripheral smear treated with an acidic solution & counterstained, red cells containing acid-soluble HbA appear as pale ghosts compared to deeply red stained red cells containing acid-resistant Hb. FCan also be used to detect HbF containing cells in p-thalassemia, hereditary persistence of hemoglobin F, sickle cell disease &myelodysplastic syndrome. Increased HbF is also found in congenital red cell aplasia (Blackfan-Diamond syndrome) & congenital aplastic anemia (Fanconianemia), JMML, presence of erythropoietic stress (haemolysis, bleeding, recovery from acute bone marrow failure) and in pregnancy.",
