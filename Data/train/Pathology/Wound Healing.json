Which of the following cells is the principal mediator of scar formation in the central nervous system of this patient?",
        "exp": "Damage to the brain or spinal cord is followed by the growth of capillaries and gliosis (i.e., the proliferation of astrocytes and microglia). Gliosis in the central nervous system is the equivalent of scar formation elsewhere; once established, it remains permanently. In spinal cord injuries, axonal regeneration can be seen up to 2 weeks after injury. After 2 weeks, gliosis has taken place and attempts at axonal regeneration end. In the central nervous system, axonal regeneration occurs only in the hypothalamohypophysial region, where glial and capillary barriers do not interfere with axonal regeneration.

Such a wound requires only minimal cell proliferation and neovascularization to heal, and the result is a small scar.

This wound requires wound contraction, extensive cell proliferation, and neovascularization (granulation tissue) to heal. Granulation tissue is eventually resorbed and replaced by a large scar that is functionally and esthetically unsatisfactory. - The other choices are impoant determinants of the outcome of wound healing, but not a deciding factor in primary and secondary intention healing.

After 4 weeks of wound healing, the strength of the wound is only 10%. 70% of the wound strength is only achieved after about 10-12 weeks of wound healing. 3.) The initial steps of wound contraction involve the formation, at the edge of the wound, of a network of myofibroblasts, which are modified fibroblasts exhibiting many of the ultrastructural and functional features of contractile smooth muscle cells.
