To explain the two patterns of occurrence of retinoblastoma, Knudson proposed his now canonic \"two hit\" hypothesis of oncogenesis. Two mutations (hits), involving both alleles of RB at chromosome locus 13q14, are required to produce retinoblastoma. In familial Retinoblastoma cases, children inherit one defective copy of the RB gene in the germline (the first hit), and the other copy is normal. Retinoblastoma develops when the normal RB allele is mutated in retinoblasts as a result of a spontaneous somatic mutation (the second hit). Because such second hits seem to be viually inevitable in a small fraction of retinoblasts, most individuals inheriting a germline defect in one RB allele develop unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma, and the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. In sporadic Retinoblastoma cases both normal RB alleles must undergo somatic mutation in the same retinoblast (two hits). The probability of this event is low (explaining why retinoblastoma is an uncommon tumor in the general population), but the end result is the same: a retinal cell that has completely lost RB function and becomes cancerous.

Beclin -1 when it forms a complex with BCL-2 which inhibit apoptosis, the complex inhibits the autophagy process. Inhibition of autophagy might lead to malignancy. Exposure of cells to radiation or chemotherapeutic agents induces apoptosis by a mechanism that is initiated by DNA damage (genotoxic stress) and that involves the tumor-suppressor gene TP53. p53 protein accumulates in cells when DNA is damaged, and it arrests the cell cycle (at the G1 phase) to allow time for repair. However, if the damage is too great to be repaired successfully, p53 triggers apoptosis. When TP53 is mutated or absent (as it is in many cancers), cells with damaged DNA fail to undergo p53-mediated apoptosis and instead survive. In such cells, the DNA damage may result in mutations of various types that lead to neoplastic transformation. Thus, p53 serves as a critical \"life or death\" switch following genotoxic stress. Among the proteins whose production is stimulated by p53 are several pro-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family, notably BAX, BAK and some BH3-only proteins.",

Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is most commonly seen with DIC, TTP, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), malignant HTN, SLE, and disseminated cancer. Macroangiopathic schistocyte is seen in patient with prosthetic hea valve. Sickle cell anemia: Blockage of vessels by sickled cells causes pain crises and tissue infarction, paicularly of the marrow and spleen. Red cell membrane damage caused by repeated bouts of sickling results in a moderate to severe hemolytic anemia.",
