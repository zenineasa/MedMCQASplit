        "question": "A 16-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency room after sustaining a stab wound to the chest during a fight. Physical examination reveals a 1-cm entry wound at the right 5th intercostal space in the midclavicular line. His temperature is 37degC (98. 6degF), respirations are 35 per minute and blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg. A chest X-ray shows air in the right pleural space. Which of the following pulmonary conditions is the expected complication of pneumothorax arising in this patient?",
        "exp": "Pneumothorax is defined as the presence of air in the pleural cavity, may be due to traumatic perforation of the pleura or may be spontaneous. Traumatic causes include penetrating wounds of the chest wall (e. g., stab wound or a rib fracture). Pneumothorax causes collapse of a previously expanded lung, a condition that is termed atelectasis. Chylothorax is the accumulation of lymphatic fluid within the pleural space and is a rare complication of trauma.",

Her temperature is 37degC (98. 6degF), respirations are 42 per minute and blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg. Physical examination shows cyanosis and the use of accessory respiratory muscles. A CT scan of the chest is normal on arrival. Her condition is complicated by fever, leukocytosis and a positive blood culture for staphylococci (sepsis). Two days later, the patient develops rapidly progressive respiratory distress and a pattern of \"interstitial pneumonia\" can be seen on a chest X-ray. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) refers to a non specific pattern of reaction to injury of alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells from a variety of acute insults.
