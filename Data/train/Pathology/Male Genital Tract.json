A) Germ cell tumors# More than 95% of testicular tumors are germ cell tumors. They are further divided into -i) Seminoma* It is the most common germ cell tumor of testis. Female counterpart of seminoma is dysgerminoma of ovary. ii) Non-seminoma germ cell tumors (NSGCT)* These are spermatocytic seminomay embryonal carcinoma, Yolk sac tumor (also called endodermal sinus tumor or infantile embryonal carcinoma), teratoma, and choriocarcinoma.# Risk factors for germ cell tumors of testis are -i) Cryptorchidism (abdominal > inguinal, i. e. higher the undescended testis more the chances of malignancy). ii) Testicular feminization syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome. iii) Excess 12P copy number either in the term of i(12P) or increased 12P an aberranthy banded marker chromosome.

Koilocytosis is particularly characteristic of HPV infection. Candidiasis can be associated with inflammation, such as balanoposthitis, but not condylomata. Recurrent gonococcal infection indicates that the patient is sexually active and at risk for additional infections, but is not the cause for the condylomata. The gonococcal infection causes suppurative lesions in which there may be liquefactive necrosis and a neutrophilic exudate or mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Circumcision generally reduces risks for infections. Phimosis is a nonretractile prepuce, and paraphimosis refers to forcible retraction of the prepuce that produces pain and urinary obstruction.",

It is the most common urologic condition requiring surgical treatment in infants. In 5% of male infants born at term and 30% of those born prematurely, the testes are not located in the scrotum or are easily retracted. In the large majority of these infants, the testis will descend into the scrotum during the first year of life. The descent of the testis may be arrested at any point from the abdominal cavity to the upper scrotum. According to their location, the cryptorchid testes can be classified as abdominal, inguinal, or upper scrotal. Anorchia (choice A) refers to congenital absence of testes.

Hormones in BPH* Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a metabolite of testosterone, is the most important mediator of prostatic growth. DHT is synthesized in the prostate from circulating testosterone by the action of the enzyme 5a-reductase, type 2. DHT can act in an autocrine fashion on the stromal cells or in paracrine fashion by diffusing into nearby epithelial cells. In both of these cell types, DHT binds to nuclear androgen receptors and signals the transcription of growth factors.* DHT is ten times more potent than testosterone because it dissociates from the androgen receptor more slowly.* Testosterone promotes prostate cell proliferation but relatively low levels of serum testosterone are found in patients with BPH.* Estrogen may also contribute to BPH, this effect appears to be mediated mainly through local conversion of androgens to estrogen in the prostate tissue rather than a direct effect of estrogen itself.

Epispadias is a congenital condition in which the urethra opens abnormally on the dorsal aspect of the penis. Bowen disease, which is squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the penis, occurs in adults. Phimosis is a constriction preventing retraction of the prepuce. It can be congenital, but more likely is the result of inflammation of the foreskin of the penis (e. g., balanitis, a form of local inflammation of the glans penis).",

Cryptorchidism - It is a complete/paial failure of the intra-abdominal testes to descend into the scrotal sac and is associated with testicular dysfunction. - It is associted with increased incidence of germ cell tumors of testes, even if the testis is surgically moved from its ectopic location back to the scrotum. - Physical examination reveals only one palpable testes in Scrotum and there may be palpable mass in inguinal region. - Descent of testes occurs in two phases: 1. Transabdominal phase - During this phase, the testes comes to lie within the lower abdomen or brim of the pelvis. This phase is regulated by mullerian inhibiting substance. 2. Inguinoscrotal Phase - In this phase the testes descend through the inguinal canal into the scrotum This phase is regulated by androgen-induced calcitonin gene-related peptide from the genitofemoral nerve. - The descent of testes may arrest anywhere in between the pathway but the most common site is in the inguinal canal - Histological changes: arrested germ cell development associated with marked hyalinization and thickening of the basement membrane of spermatic tubules = A hydrocele is a serous fluid collection in the scrotum. = Orchitis (inflammation of the testis) can result from bacterial or viral infection. = A varicocele results from dilation of the veins of the spermatic cord, and the term \"bag of worms\" aptly describes the abnormality.",
