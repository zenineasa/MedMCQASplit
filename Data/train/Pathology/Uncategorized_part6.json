Maintain blood in fluid state while circulating within the vascular system. 2 Arrest bleeding at the site of injury by formation of hemostatic plug. 3. Ensure the removal of hemostatic plug when healing is complete. o The components of normal hemostasis include: - 1. Blood vessels (endothelium) 2. Platelets 3. Plasma coagulation factors and their inhibitors. 4. Fibrinolytic system. o When a blood vessel is injured, several steps occur in hemostasis at the site of injury': - A. Vasoconstriction o After initial injury, there is a brief period arteriolar vasoconstriction, minimizing vessel diameter and stowing bleeding. o This is due to reflex neurogenic mechanism and augmented by a potent endothelium derived vasoconstrictor endothelin. o However this effect is transient, bleeding would resume if there will no activation of platelet and coagulation system. B. Primary hemostasis o Endothelial injury exposes highly thrombogenic subendothelial extracellular matrix which allows the platelets to bind (adhere) with collagen of ECM. o Binding of platelets activates these cells and platelets release secretory' granules. o These secretory' products (from secretory granules) recruit additional platelets to form primary hemostatic (platelet plug). C. Secondary hemostasis o Coagulation system is activated and thrombin is generated, o Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin. o Ultimately these events form an irreversibly fused mass of platelets, thrombin RBCs and fibrinogen -> Definitive secondary hemostatic plug. D. Repair of vessels and dissolution of the clot o The clot attracts and stimulates the growth of fibroblast and smooth muscle cells within the vessel wall, and begins the repair process. o At this stage the fibrinolytic system is also activated, resulting in the dissolution of the clot.",

These are consequence of anemia or leucocytosis. Some patients may also present with signs of abnormal hemostatis such as bleeding gum. Peripheral smear shows pancytopenia- The no. of Leukemic cells in peripheral blood in AML is highly variable sometimes being more than 10000 cell/ ml but being under 10, 000 in 50% of patients. Occasionally the peripheral smear may not contain any blasts (aleukemic leukemia). So even in pts with ancytopenia bone marrow examination is essential to exclude acute leukemia. Bone marrow examination reveals 26% blast/cells:- Harrison says - \"The diagnosis of AML is' established by presence of more than 20% myeloblast in bone marrow. \" The blast cells were mature and contain Auer rods: Auer rods are red staining rod like structures (representing abnormal azurophilic granules) present in myeloblast in AML. The presence of Auer rods is considered as definite evidence of myeloid differentiation. They are most numerous in M3 form of AML. Neutrophil with Pseudo Pelger Huet anomaly:- Pseudo Pelger Huet cells are neutrophils with only 2 nuclear lobes and are frequently seen in myelodysplastic syndrome.

MALT lymphomas appear to have similar clinical, pathological and molecular features regardless of organs of origin. The most common cause of \"pro-lymphomatous\" inflammation in the stomach is chronic H. pylori infection, which is found in association with most cases of gastric MALToma.

Endothelial injuryo Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade. o Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornestone in the development of atherosclerosis. o After injury, endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 andthere is increased permeability to endothelium. o TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression. 2. Migration of leukocyteso When VCAM- 1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium. o Leukocytes than cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space. o Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells --> formation of earliest lesion, i. e. fatty streak. o Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modified. LDL). Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferationo Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-a and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation. 4.

Primary active transport-energy derived from ATP. Specific carriers are utilized, which are saturable. (1) Ca2+-ATPase pumps are important active transports in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. (2) Na+K+-ATPase pump is present in all plasma membranes. - Establishes and maintains a Na+ and K+ gradient by transporting Na+ out and K+ into the cell. - The Na+ concentration gradient is the force for secondary active transport mechanisms. d. Secondary active transport-ATP establishes an ionic gradient, which is the driving force (secondary transport). (1) Na+ gradient established by membrane pumps drive this system. (2) Protein carriers bind both the substance transported and Na+. (3) Cotransport systems-Na+ and substance transported move in the same direction. Examples include: - Glucose and galactose across GI mucosa and resorption in renal tubule. - Amino acid transport in GI mucosa and renal tubules. (4) Countertransport- - Na+ and transported substance move in opposite directions. Examples include: - Na+/H+ exchange (H+ out and Na+ into cells). - Na+/Ca2+ exchange (Ca2+ out and Na+ into cells)",

Sympathetic paragangliomas consist of endocrine cells which can produce catecholamines. These tumors are located intraabdominally. Parasympathetic paragangliomas develop from the paraganglias of parasympethicus such as paraganglium caroticum, jugulare, tympanicum and intravagale. These tumors are predominantly found in the area of head, neck, and mediastinum. Angiogram of carotid body tumor reveals widening of the carotid bifurcation with prominent tumor vascularization.

Although a definitive distinction from NHL can be made only by examination of a tissue biopsy, several clinical features favor the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma.

Younger patients with more favorable subtypes tend to present with stage I or stage II disease and usually are free of so-called \"B symptoms\" (fever, weight loss, night sweats). Patients with advanced disease (stages III and IV) are more likely to exhibit B symptoms as well as pruritus and anemia.

When dysplastic changes are marked and involves the entire thickness of the epithelium but the leasion remains confined by the basement membrane, it is referred to as carcinoma in situ. Once the tumour cells breach the basement membrane, the tumour is said to be invasive. For example, carcinoma in situ of the skin, also called Bowen's disease, is the accumulation of neoplastic epidermal cells within the epidermis only. For this reason, CIS will usually not form a tumour. Rather, the lesion is flat (in the skin, cervix, etc) or follows the existing architecture of the organ (in the breast, lung, etc). Some CIS, however, form tumours, for example colon polyps or papillary cancer of the bladder as well as some CIS of the breast (more properly called Ductal Carcinoma in situ). Many forms of invasive carcinoma originate from a CIS lesion. Therefore, CIS is considered a precursor or incipient form of cancer that may, if left untreated long enough, transform into a malignant neoplasm. These terms are related since they represent the three steps of the progression toward cancer: Dysplasia is the earliest form of pre-cancerous lesion recognizable in a biopsy. Dysplasia can be low grade or high grade. The risk of low-grade dysplasia transforming into cancer is low. Carcinoma in situ is synonymous with high-grade dysplasia in most organs. The risk of transforming into cancer is high. Invasive carcinoma, commonly called cancer, is the final step in this sequence.",

Which of the following is the MOST likely pathogenetic mechanism of this patient's anemia?",
        "exp": "Autoimmune gastritis is characterized by atrophy and chronic inflammation of mucosa of the fundus and body of the stomach. This form of gastritis is due to an autoimmune response mediated by autoantibodies against intrinsic factor (IF). Most such autoantibodies block binding of vitamin B12 to IF (\"blocking\" antibodies), thus preventing absorption of vitamin B12. The resultant picture is megaloblastic anemia, with abnormally large (macrocytic) erythrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils. Also know: Chronic blood loss and deficient iron absorption cause iron deficiency anemia, with the former being the most common etiology in industrialized countries. Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by small (microcytic) erythrocytes (mean corpuscular volume < 80 mm3). H. pylori infection is an impoant pathogenetic factor in chronic gastritis affecting the antral mucosa in isolation, or in association with involvement of the body of the stomach. Chronic inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration of the mucosa is found on biopsy, and H. pylori can be demonstrated by appropriate silver staining. H. pylori-associated chronic gastritis is usually asymptomatic or manifests with mild and nonspecific upper abdominal discomfo. There is a strong association between H. pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease. H. pylori is also suspected to play an etiologic role in gastric lymphoma and carcinoma. Ref: Mills J.

        "exp": "In the retention mucocele, there is a blockage along the course of the minor salivary duct which causes pooling of saliva behind the obstruction and localized swelling. This pooling of saliva causes a pressure build-up and dilates the duct of the minor salivary gland. This dilated ductal epithelium forms a lining around the saliva and mimics a cyst-like lesion. Ranula is the clinical term for a mucocele occurring on the floor of the mouth after trauma to components of the sublingual glands. Two varieties of ranula exist: cystic (mucus retention cyst) and pseudocystic (mucus retention phenomenon or mucocele). In the cystic type, there is partial obstruction of the distal end of a sublingual gland duct that results in a small epithelial lined cyst usually less than 1 cm in diameter. However, the pseudocystic type, which is more common, forms as a result of extravasation of mucus into the fibrous connective tissue after a tear in a sublingual gland duct and, as in the case of a mucocele, arises as a result of the escape of mucus into the adjacent connective tissue. The clinical term 'plunging ranula' is used when extravasated mucus dissects through the mylohyoid muscle and along the fascial planes of the neck, producing a swelling evident in the floor of the mouth. Key concept: Ranula is specifically for this mucocele occurring on the floor of the mouth after trauma to components of the sublingual glands. John S. Mc. Donald, in Mc.

        "exp": "Teratoma Teratomas are divided into three categories: (1) Mature (benign) Most benign teratomas are cystic and are known as dermoid cysts. These neoplasms are presumably derived from the ectodermal differentiation of totipotential cells. They are bilateral in 10% to 15% of cases. Characteristically, they are unilocular cysts containing hair and cheesy sebaceous material. On section, they reveal a thin wall lined by an opaque, grey-white, wrinkled, apparent epidermis. Generally, in one area of the cyst wall, a solid prominence is seen known as Rokitansky's protuberance where tissue elements such as tooth, bone, cartilage & various other odd tissues are present. On histologic examination, the cyst wall is composed of stratified squamous epithelium with underlying sebaceous glands, hair shafts, and other skin adnexal structures. In most cases, structures from other germ layers can be identified, such as cartilage, bone, thyroid tissue, and other organoid formations. Dermoid cysts are sometimes incorporated within the wall of a mucinous cystadenoma. About 1% of the dermoids undergo malignant transformation of any one of the component elements ( but most commonly, squamous cell carcinoma). (2) Monodermal or Specialized Teratomas The rare group of tumors, the most common of which are struma ovarii and carcinoid. They are always unilateral, although a contralateral teratoma may be present. Struma ovarii is composed entirely of mature thyroid tissue. Interestingly, these thyroidal neoplasms may hyperfunction, causing hyperthyroidism. The ovarian carcinoid, which presumably arises from intestinal epithelium in a teratoma, might, in fact, be functioning, particularly in large tumors, producing 5-hydroxytryptamine and the carcinoid syndrome. (3) Immature Malignant Teratomas These are rare tumors that differ from benign teratomas in that the component tissue resembles that observed in the fetus or embryo rather than in the adult. The tumor is found chiefly in prepubertal adolescents and young women. These grow rapidly and frequently penetrate the capsule with local spread or metastases. On microscopy, there are varying amounts of immature tissue differentiating toward cartilage, glands, bone, muscle, nerve, and others. An important risk for the subsequent extraovarian spread is the histologic grade of tumor, which is based on the proportion of tissue containing immature neuroepithelium.",

Deformation o As the name suggests (deformation), there is alteration in shape or structure of a pa that has differentiated normally. o This represents the normal response of a tissue to unusual mechanical forces. o For example, CTEV caused by intrauterine molding due to excessive pressure in oligohydraminious. o That means, in deformation the pa had developed normally, but due to unusual pressure deformity takes place. o As there is no error in organogenesis, it is referred to as secondary error in morphogenesis and is due to extrinsicdisturbance of development process (due to excessive pressure). Disruption o Disruption results from breakdown of the tissue that was previously normal in development, i. e. secondary destruction of previously normal organ or body region. o For example, congenital amputation due to constriction amniotic band. o As there is no error in organogenesis, it is referred to as secondary error in morphogenesis and is due to extrinsic disturbance of development process (due to constriction band). o Dysplasia is an abnormal organization of cells. Sequence o When a single primary structural defect in morphogenesis produces multiple anomalies through a cascading process of secondary and teiary problems in morphogenesis. o For example in spina bifida, the primary defect is single i. e. failure to close neural tube, which results in secondary anomalies such as club foot due to neuromuscular imbalance, bladder and bowel problems due to neuromuscular imbalance etc. o Depending upon the initating event, sequence may be: i) Malformation sequence Initiating event is malformationii) Deformation sequence --) Initiating event is deformationiii) Disruption sequence --) Initiating event is disruption. Syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome) o In multiple malformation syndrome, there is primary developmental anamoly of two or more system (In contrast to sequence where the primary structural defect is single. o So, a syndrome is a constellation of congenital anomalies that cannot to be explained to arise in a sequence.

        "exp": "Atherosclerosis of coronary aeries is the underlying pathologic change in the great majority of cases of ischemic heart disease. Ischemic heart disease may manifest with several clinical syndromes depending on distribution and morphology of atherosclerotic changes and rate of progression. A slowly progressive increase in luminal stenosis in all major coronary vessels results in diffuse ischemia of the myocardium and dropout of scattered myocytes throughout the ventricular walls. Eventually, such a reduction in myocardial mass will lead to decreased contractility and heart failure. Patients with this chronic ischemic heart disease often come to clinical attention with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, sometimes without any history of chest pain or arrhythmias. Myocardial infarction may be clinically silent (ie, without pain), although it is usually associated with severe chest pain. If the infarct is extensive, cardiogenic shock ensues. All forms of angina can be easily ruled out as correct choices since angina indicates, by definition, paroxysmal chest pain due to reversible myocardial ischemia. Prinzmetal angina is an uncommon form of angina occurring at rest and caused by vasospasm. Stable angina refers to chest pain with a predictable pattern of onset, usually after physical effos, emotional excitement, or any cause of increased cardiac load. Ref: Antman E. M., Selwyn A.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Fundal glands of intestine. Calcification refers to the deposition of calcium salts in vital or dying/ dead tissues. The two classical types of calcification are dystrophic and metastatic. Dystrophic calcification refers to the deposition of calcium salts in dead or dying tissues. It occurs principally in areas of coagulative, liquefactive, caseous and/or fat necrosis that persist for rather long periods of time. Dystrophic calcification occurs in the presence of normal levels of serum calcium (around 10 mg/100 ml) and in the absence of derangement in calcium metabolism. The exact form that the calcium accumulates in is hydroxyapatite. Calcification in dead tissue:- Caseous necrosis in T. B. is most common site of dystrophic calcification. Liquefactive necrosis in chronic abscesses may get calcified. Fat necrosis following acute pancreatitis or traumatic fat necrosis in breasts results in deposition of calcium soaps. Infarcts may undergo D. C. Thrombi, esp. in veins, may produce phleoboliths. Haematomas in the vicinity of bones may undergo D. C. Dead parasites like schistostoma eggs show D. C. Congenital toxoplasmosis involving CNS visualised by calcification in infarct brain. Calcification in the degenerated tissue. Dense scars may undergo hyalinedegeneration and calcification. Atheroma in aoa and coronaries frequently undergo calcification. Cysts can show calcifcation. Calcinosis cutis is condition in which there are irregular nodular deposits of calcium salts in skin and subcutaneous tissue. Senile degenerative changes may be accompanied by calcification. Metastatic calcification refers to the deposition of calcium salts in vital tissues in association with a defect in calcium metabolism that is characterized by hypercalcemia. The usual causes of the hypercalcemia include Hyperparathyroidism, either primary or secondary, Vitamin-D intoxication, Deficiency of magnesium and. Hypercalcemia of malignancy. Metastatic calcification may occur widely throughout the body, but it is found principally in interstitial tissue of blood vessels, kidneys, lungs and gastric mucosa. Calcinosis is a term sometimes used to describe extensive metastatic calcification. Calciphylaxis is the process whereby calcium precipitates in tissues in response to a challenging agent such as iron.",

SLEAntinuclear antibody (ANA) testing and anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-EN A) form the mainstay of serologic testing for SLE. Several techniques are used to detect ANAs. Clinically the most widely used method is indirect immunofluorescence. The pattern of fluorescence suggests the type of antibody present in the patient's serum. ANA screening yields positive results in many connective tissue disorders and other autoimmune diseases, and may occur in normal individuals. Subtypes of antinuclear antibodies include anti-Smith and anti-double stranded DNA (ds. DNA) antibodies (which are linked to SLE) and anti-histone antibodies (which are linked to drug-induced lupus). Anti-ds. DNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE; they are present in 70% of cases, whereas they appear in only 0. 5% of people without SLE. The anti-ds.

A: Pancreatic carcinoma CA 19-9 is tumour marker for colon cancer and pancreatic cancer CA19-9/ Carbohydrate antigen 19-9/ Cancer antigen 19-9/ Sialylated Lewis (a) antigen It was discovered in patients with colon cancer and pancreatic cancer in 1981. Increased levels of CA19-9 are also found in non-malignant conditions, such as Mirizzi's syndrome and diseases of the bile ducts and liver. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology discourage the use of CA19-9 as a test for cancer, paicularly pancreatic cancer. The reason is that the test may be falsely normal (false negative) in many cases, or abnormally elevated in people who have no cancer at all (false positive). The main use of CA19-9 is therefore to see whether a pancreatic tumor is secreting it; if that is the case, then the levels should fall when the tumor is treated, and they may rise again if the disease recurs. In patients who lack the Lewis antigen (a blood type protein on red blood cells), which is about 5% of the population, CA19-9 is not elevated in pancreatic cancer even with large tumors because they have a deficiency of a fucosyltransferase enzyme that is needed to produce CA19-9 as well as the Lewis antigen",

        "exp": "Graft versus host (gvh) diseases Graft versus host disease occurs in any situation in which immunologically competent cells or their precursors are transplanted into immunologically crippled patients and the transferred cells recognize alloantigens in the host. Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation but may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e. g. the liver) or transfusion of unirradiated blood. Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation. When such recipients receive normal bone marrow cells from allogeneic donors, the immunocompetent, T cells present in the donor marrow recognize the recipient's HLA antigen as a foreign antigen and react against them. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognize and attack host tissues. In clinical practice, GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between HLA matched donor and recipient. Pathological changes in GVH diseases There are three principal target tissues affected in GVHD: Skin, liver, and gut. GVHD may be acute or chronic:- A) Acute GVHD Acute GVHD occurs within 100 days (usually 10-50 days) of bone marrow transplantation. The manifestations of acute GVHD are 1. Skin It is the most commonly affected tissue in acute GVHD. There is generalized rash (maculopapular). Histological findings are i. Perivascular mononuclear infiltrates. ii. Vacuolar degradation of dermo-epidermal junction iii. Dyskeratotic or eosinophilic bodies in the epidermis. iv. Epidermolysis & bullae. v. Denudation of epidermis (separation of epidermis from dermis), 2. Gut The primary clinical manifestation of gut GVHD is diarrhoea and abdominal pain. There is lymphocytic infiltrate at the crypts with accompanied necrosis and drop out of crypt cells. 3. Liver Lymphocytic infiltrates in the interlobular and marginal bile ducts are characteristic histopathologic findings. This results in hepatitis with necrosis of hepatocytes and bites duct epithelial cells. There is inflammation of the parenchyma and portal tracts. These findings lead to a clinically identifiable cholestatic picture. B) Chronic GVHD It occurs after 100 days of bone marrow transplantation. Manifestations are:- 1. Skin Extensive cutaneous injury, with the destruction of skin appendages and fibrosis of the dermis. 2. Gut Damage to GIT may result in necrosis, ulceration fibrosis and strictures. 3. Liver The findings of liver damage are i) Portal tract inflammation ii) Selective bile duct destruction iii. Endothelitis of the portal vein and hepatitis vein radicles, in which a subendothelial lymphocytic infiltrate lifts the endothelium from its basement membrane. iv. Intrahepatic cholestasis",

        "exp": "Autoimmune destruction of parietal cells would lead to decreased secretion of gastric acid and intrinsic factor. The diminished availability of intrinsic factor would result in poor absorption of dietary vitamin B12. Over time, the vitamin B12 deficiency could lead to pernicious anemia, which is characterized by increased production of macrocytes (megaloblasts) by the bone marrow. Because of the decrease in gastric acid secretion, luminal bacteria would most likely exhibit increased (not decreased) growth. One of the functions of HCl secreted by the parietal cells is to sterilize the gastric lumen. Patients with Type A gastritis have an increased likelihood of developing gastric carcinoma (not decreased, ). A decrease in acid secretion leads to increased secretion of gastrin (not decreased) by antral G cells. This is because low gastric pH (less than 3) inhibits gastrin secretion paracrine release of somatostatin from cells in the gastric mucosa that can sense the acidity. With decreased parietal cells, the pH of the gastric lumen would rise and remove this inhibitory component. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J. F., Moos P. J., Mackey D. C., Brown T. G. (2008).

        "question": "Hypocalcemia is seen with which of the following: September 2008",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Acute pancreatitis. Hypoalbuminemia is the most common cause of hypocalcemia and is due to cirrhosis, nephrosis, malnutrition, burns, chronic illness, and sepsis. Hypomagnesemia causes end-organ resistance to PTH and inhibits the hypocalcemic feedback loop through unceain mechanisms. Causes of hypomagnesemia include pancreatitis, aminoglycoside treatment, amphotericin B, loop diuretics, alcoholism, and malnutrition. Hyperphosphatemia may be seen in critical illness and in patients who have ingested phosphate-containing enemas. Phosphate binds calcium avidly, causing acute hypocalcemia. Multifactorial causes are probably the most clinically relevant hypocalcemic emergencies include the following:- Acute pancreatitis: Free fatty acids chelate calcium, causing saponification in the retroperitoneum.- Rhabdomyolysis: Increased phosphates from creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and other anions (i. e., lactate, bicarbonate) chelate calcium.- Sepsis can cause hypocalcemia through many mechanisms.- Toxic shock syndrome can cause hypocalcemia. High calcitonin levels cause low calcium.- Malignancy: Osteoblastic metastases (e. g., breast cancer, prostate cancer) and tumor lysis syndrome may cause hypocalcemia (by differing mechanisms).- Hepatic or renal insufficiency: Calciuresis, hypomagnesemia, hypoalbuminemia, and low active vitamin D levels may contribute to poor calcium homeostasis.- Infiltrative disease: Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and hemochromatosis may infiltrate the parathyroids, causing dysfunction.-- Toxicologic causes include hydrofluoric acid burn or ingestion. Enhanced protein binding and anion chelation- Protein binding is enhanced by elevated pH and free fatty acid release in high catecholamine states. Anion chelation is seen in high phosphate states (e. g., renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, mesenteric ischemia, oraladministration of phosphate-containing enemas); high citrate states (e. g., massive blood transfusion, radiocontrastdyes); and high bicarbonate, lactate, and oxalate levels. Medication effects- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid production resulting in reduced calcium absorption.- Selective serotonin inhibitors can have a calcium antagonistic effect on smooth muscle, paicularly vascular endothelium.- Calcitonin and bisphosphonates cause chelation and end-organ inhibition.- Phenobarbital and phenytoin enhance vitamin D catabolism and decrease calcium resorption in the gut. Foscarnet complexes with calcium. Fluoride, paicularly hydrofluoric acid, chelates calcium avidly and causes profound hypocalcemia. Ethylene glycol complexes with calcium. Estrogen inhibits bone resorption. Cimetidine decreases gastric pH, slowing fat breakdown, which is necessary to complex calcium for gut absorption. Aluminum and alcohol suppress PTH. Gadolinium-based contrast material can falsely lower serum calcium levels and should be considered if levels are drawn sholy after magnetic resonance imaging. Postsurgical effects. Parathyroid adenoma resection causes a transient hypocalcemia due to end-organ PTH resistance in the first postoperative day. Pancreatectomy prevents calcium absorption in the duodenum and the jejunum by eliminating necessary enzymes. Small bowel syndrome causes hypocalcemia by reducing the surface available to absorb fatty acids and calcium. PTH deficiency/resistance. Infiltrative diseases include Wilson disease and metastatic cancer. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is due to PTH resistance and has many forms, most notably Albright disease. Renal failure can result in a variety of endocrine disorders, occasionally including hypocalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency/resistance- Rickets may be due to lack of vitamin D or end-organ receptor resistance.- Hepatorenal disease: The liver and the kidney provide intermediary enzymes to form active 1, 25 (OH)2 D.",

LDLs are rich in cholesterol, being composed of about 45% cholesterol or cholesteryl esters. In both dietary and familial hypercholesterolemia, circulating LDL levels are increased. Ref: Grundy S.

Rheumatic fever Rheumatic fever It is an inflammatory disease that occurs following a Streptococcus pyogenes infection, such as streptococcal pharyngitis or scarlet fever. Believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity that can involve the heart, joints, skin, and brain, the illness typically develops two to three weeks after a streptococcal infection. Acute rheumatic fever commonly appears in children between the ages of 6 and 15, with only 20% of first-time attacks occurring in adults.

This infection is caused by the protozoa E histolytica, which ascends the poal venous system. Amebic liver abscess is an impoant cause of space-occupying lesions of the liver, mainly in developing countries E histolytica exists in 2 forms. The cyst stage is the infective form, and the trophozoite stage causes invasive disease. People who chronically carry E histolytica shed cysts in their feces; these cysts are transmitted primarily by food and water contamination. Cysts are resistant to gastric acid, but the wall is broken down by trypsin in the small intestine. Trophozoites are released and colonize the cecum. To initiate symptomatic infection, E histolytica trophozoites present in the lumen must adhere to the underlying mucosa and penetrate the mucosal layer. Liver involvement occurs following invasion of E histolytica into mesenteric venules. Amebae then enter the poal circulation and travel to the liver where they typically form large abscesses. The abscess contains acellular proteinaceous debris, which is thought to be a consequence of induced apoptosis and is surrounded by a rim of amebic trophozoites invading the tissue. The right lobe of the liver is more commonly affected than the left lobe. This has been attributed to the fact that the right lobe poal laminar blood flow is supplied predominantly by the superior mesenteric vein, whereas the left lobe poal blood flow is supplied by the splenic vein.",

Alcohol is one of the most frequent causes of liver steatosis. At least in pa, the mechanism of alcohol-induced steatosis is due to acetaldehyde formation, which disrupts microtubules and increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio. Fatty change of the macrovesicular type is entirely reversible if the noxious stimulus (in this case, excessive alcohol intake) is removed. Acute hepatitis results from acute insults to the liver. Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by hepatocyte necrosis, intracytoplasmic hyaline bodies (Mallory bodies), and neutrophilic infiltration. Usually, alcoholic hepatitis develops after a bout of heavy alcohol consumption. Fatty change may be superimposed on histologic signs of hepatitis, but steatosis does not evolve into hepatitis if alcohol intake is discontinued. Chronic hepatitis may result from long-term heavy alcohol consumption and is characterized by chronic inflammation of poal spaces and progressive fibrosis. Steatosis is usually associated with chronic hepatitis due to alcohol. Hyperplastic nodules represent a morphologic component of cirrhosis. Foci of hepatocyte hyperplasia develop as a compensatory mechanism to continuous loss of hepatocytes.",

Growth factors involved in the process of angiogenesiso VEGF is the most impoant growth factor in adult tissues undergoing angiogenesis. o The most impoant receptor for VEGF is VEGFR-2, a tyrosine kinase receptor. o VEGF induces the migration of EPCs in the bone marrow, and enhances the proliferation and differentiation of these cells at sites of angiogenesis. o FGF 2 can also stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. o Newly formed vessels are fragile and need to become stabilized, which requires the recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells (periendothelial cells).

Preoteolytic degradation of basement membrane by metalloproteinases (MMPs) and disruption of cellto-cell contact between endothelial cells by plasminogen activator. Migration of endothelial cells towards angiogenic stimulus. Proliferation of endothelial cells, just behind the leading front of migrating cells. Maturation of endothelial cells. Recruitment of periendothelial cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) to form the mature cells. 2. Angiogenesis from endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) EPCs can be recruited from the bone marrow into tissues to initiate angiogenesis. Growth factors involved in the process of angiogenesis VEGF is the most impoant growth factor in adult tissues undergoing angiogenesis. The most impoant receptor for VEGF is VEGFR-2, a tyrosine kinase receptor. VEGF induces the migration of EPCs in the bone marrow, and enhances the proliferation and differentiation of these cells at sites of angiogenesis. FGF 2 can also stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Newly formed vessels are fragile and need to become stabilized, which requires the recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells (periendothelial cells).

        "exp": "RAS protein is a signal transducing protein. Signal transducing proteins receive growth signals from outside the cell and transmit it to the nucleus. Normally RAS proteins are attached to the cytoplasmic aspect of the plasma membrane where they keep on converting between an active signal transmitting state and an inactive quiescent state. In the inactive state, the RAS proteins bind Guanosine diphosphate (GDP). When the cells are stimulated by growth factors or other receptor - ligand interactions, RAS becomes activated by exchanging GDP for GTP. This activates RAS then recruits raf - 1 and activates MAP-kinase pathway. The MAP kinases so activated target nuclear transcription factors and then they promote mitogenesis. The net result of this pathway is activation of protein phosphorylation cascade which amplifies the signal and stimulates quiescent cells to enter the growth cycle. In the normal cells the activated state of this RAS protein is transient because the normal RAS proteins have intrinsic GTPase activity. This GTPase activity hydrolyzes GTP to GDP and thus returns the RAS protein to its normal quiescent stage. Now, what is the role of GTPase activating proteins, (GAPS) in this pathway. The GTPase activating protien (GAPS) significantly accelarates the intrinsic GTPase activity of the active RAS protein. The (GAPs) bind to the active RAS and augment its GTPase activity by more than 1000 fold leading to rapid hydrolysis of GTP back to GDP. Thus GAPs function as brakes that prevents uncontrolled RAS activity. Mutation of the RAS protein causes cancer. Mutation in the RAS protein causes permanent activation of the RAS protein. The mutant RAS protein can bind to GAP but their GTPase activity fails to be augumented. Therefore the mutant RAS proteins are trapped in their excited GTP bound form. This causes pathological activation of mitogenic signalling pathway leading to continuous stimulation of cells without any external trigger.

Urinalysis reveals hematuria and proteinuria; examination of the urinary sediment reveals red cell casts. Radiological and ultrasound studies fail to demonstrate an obstructive lesion. Renal biopsy shows many glomerular crescents. This presentation is most suggestive of which of the following conditions?",
        "exp": "The two principal causes of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis are anti-glomerular basement membrane (including both Goodpasture's syndrome and isolated anti-glomerular basement disease) and primary systemic vasculitis (including Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyaeritis, idiopathic rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, polyaeritis nodosa, giant-cell aeritis, and Takayasu's aeritis). A very large variety of other systemic and primary glomerular disease may occasionally cause rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, but this is usually not the typical presentation for these diseases. Diabetic nephropathy typically begins with microalbuminuria and hypertension and progresses over a 10 to 20 year period to renal failure. Hypeensive nephropathy due to essential hypertension typically presents with slowly rising BUN and creatinine; hypeensive nephropathy due to malignant hypertension presents with more rapidly rising BUN and creatinine. Lupus nephritis can have many presentations, but the most typical is proteinuria, which may be severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome. Also, 90% of cases of systemic lupus erythematosus occur in women, usually of childbearing age. Ref: Lewis J. B., Neilson E. G. (2012). Chapter 283. Glomerular Diseases. In D. L. Longo, A. S.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Point mutation. In sickle cell anemia there is missense type of point mutation. Mutations o A mutation is a permanant change in the DNA. o Mutations that affect germ cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease. o Mutations that affect somatic cells are not transmitted to progeny but are impoant in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations. o Mutations may be classified into three categories? I. Gene mutationso The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations. o These may of different types depending whether it involves complete gene or single base? (a) Point mutationA single nucleotide base is subustituted by a different base. When a pyrimidine base is subustituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine ---> Transition. When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa --> Transversion. This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i. e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product. Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation. o Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in 13-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine. Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon. o Example is13-thalassemia in which CAG codon in f3-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation. (b) Deletion and inseions. Deletion or inseion of one or two base lead to alterations in the reading frame of the DNA strand frame shift mutation. If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three framshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized. (c) Trinucleotide repeat mutationo Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide. In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain. o For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG. 2. Chromosome mutationo Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome. 3. Genome mutationo Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e. g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",

They are more common in children, and most often originate in the fouh ventricle. They are the most common intramedullary glioma of the spinal cord. Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by severe degeneration of the caudate nucleus along with degenerative changes in the putamen and coex. In addition to chorea, these patients frequently suffer from athetoid movements, progressive dementia, and behavioral disorders. Marfan syndrome is due to a defect in the gene for fibrillin.

The diagnosis of amyloidosis is made by detecting the characteristic amyloid protein in a biopsy specimen of involved tissue. o For many years rectal biopsy was the first procedure of choice. However, the capillaries in the subcutaneous fat are aften involved in patients with systemic amyloidosis and can often provide sufficient tissues for the diagnosis of amyloidosis. o Therefore, a needle aspiration biopsy of fat just under the skin of the belly (fat pad aspiration) offers a simple and less invasive method to diagnose systemic amyloidosis and biopsy of the organ with the most severe clinical involvement is often unnecessary. o When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a final diagnosis, biopsy samples can be collected from other organs. o The best sites of biopsy are abdominal fat pad (90% sensitivity) and rectal mucosa (70-80% sensitivity). Other sites are salivary glands, gingiva, skin, tongue, bone marrow, stomach.",

Multiple systolic clicks may be generated by different poions of the mitral leaflets prolapsing at different times during systole. The midsystolic click is frequently followed by a late systolic murmur usually medium to high pitched and loudest at the apex.

        "exp": "p53; Guardian of genome p53 is a tumor suppressor gene. p53 gene is located on chromosome 17. p53 acts as molecular policeman that prevents the propagation of genetically damage cell. p53 gene product, i. e. p53 protein is a DNA binding protein in the nucleus, when called into action, it controls the transcription of several other genes. The ma 'or functional activities of the 53 rotein are cell c cle arrest and initiation of a o v. tosis in res onse to DNA damage. When there is DNA damage due to irradiation, UV light or mutagenic chemicals, there is rapid increase in p53 levels. p53 causes - Cell cycle arrest p-53 induces transcription of p21, a CDK inhibitor. p21 inhibit cyclin D-CDK-4 complex and there is arrest of cell cycle late in G1 phase. This allows time for DNA repair. DNA repair p-53 also helps in DNA repair directly by inducing transcription of GADD 45 (growth arrest and DNA damage). GADD 45 encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair. If DNA damage is repaired successfully, p53 activate MDM-3 and this MDM-3 induce degradation of p-53 -> Relieve in cell cycle block. If DNA damage cannot be successfully repaired, p53 induces apoptosis by inducing the activation of apoptosis-inducing gene BAX. So p53 prevents replication of cell with defective DNA -> p53 functions as a critical gatekeeper against the formation of cancer. Mutation in p53 leads to carcinogenesis because of loss of the above protective mechanism. p-53 is the most common target for genetic alteration in human tumors: A little over 50% of human tumors contain mutation in this gene. (Note - Amongst oncogene RAS is involved most commonly).",

Type II: Osteogenesis imperfecta Osteogenesis imperfecta type II exhibits extreme bone fragility and frequent fractures. In utero fractures are present in 100% of cases. Many are stillborn, and 90% die before four weeks of age. Blue sclera may be present. Hearing loss is not common to type II OI. Dentinogenesis imperfecta may be present along with small nose, micrognathia and short trunk. Type III: Osteogenesis imperfecta Type III is associated with dentinogenesis imperfecta, sclera of variable hue, limb shortening and progressive deformities, triangular facies with frontal bossing and pulmonary hypertension. In utero fractures occur in 50% of cases. The remaining half of the cases have fractures in the neonatal period. No hearing loss has been reported in this type. Type IV: Osteogenesis imperfecta In subtype A, dentinogenesis imperfecta is absent, while in subtype B, dentinogenesis imperfecta is present.

Studies using immunoassay of human chorionic gonadotropin (h. CG) for early diagnosis of pregnancy suggest that the percentage of feilized ova lost in the first trimester might be even higher. The great majority of these cases are attributable to chromosomal abnormalities. Chromosomal studies are not routinely performed in such cases, but they are recommended when a malformed fetus has been identified or when habitual or recurrent aboions occur. Abruptio placentae, a complication of the third trimester, occurs when the placenta detaches prematurely from its implantation site. Retroplacental hemorrhage develops within the space between placenta and uterine wall, leading to interruption or severe reduction in the blood supply to the fetus. Chorioamnionitis, a complication of the second and third trimesters, results from ascending infections through the vaginal canal. Infection of chorioamniotic membranes may lead to premature rupture of membranes and aboion or premature labor. Placenta pre is a placenta implanted in the lower segment of the uterus. When dilatation of this segment begins in late pregnancy, a placenta pre may cause severe bleeding and lead to premature labor. Ref: Kipps T. J. (2010). Chapter 94.

Dysphagia, stiffness or pain in the neck, shoulder or back muscles appear concurrently. Marked rigidity interferes with the movement of chest and impairs cough and swallowing reflexes. Laryngeal spasms may lead to asphyxia. The involvement of various muscles produces rigid abdomen and stiff proximal limb muscles. Hands and feet are relatively spared and sustained contraction of facial muscles results in a grimace or sneer called risus sardonicus. The contraction of muscles of the back produces an arched back called opisthotonus. The spasms occur repetitively or spontaneously or provoked by slight stimulation. Treatment Antitoxin is injected to neutralize circulating toxin and unbound toxin. Human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) 3000-6000 units IM individual doses. Though the optimum dose is not known, a 500 unit dose is as effective as higher doses. Prophylaxis - Wound debridement and booster doses of TT.

The term delayed is used to differentiate it from a secondary' cellular response, which appears at 48-72 hours after antigen exposure and from an immediate hypersensitivity response, which generally appears within minutes, Delayed hypersensitivity is a major mechanism of defence against various intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria, fungi and certain parasites. Pathophysiology Delayed hypersensitivity is characterized by the formation of granuloma - a localized mass that contains activated macrophages (epithelioid) cells surrounded by colour of lymphocytes and giant cells. It is also called granulomatous Inflammation. The cellular events start when an antigen (eg tuberculin antigen) on antigen presenting cell comes in contact with naive CD-4 T cells -> naive CD-4 T cells recognize this peptide antigen in association with MHC - II and differentiate into T4-l cells. Induction of T4-l cells is of central importance because the expression of delayed hypersensitivity largely depends on the cytokines secreted by T4-l cells. 2.

Total CK: The values begin to rise within four to six hours and peak at 24 hours. Values return to normal within three to four days. CK-MB: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 24 hours. Values return to normal within 72 hours. Troponin T: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 48 hours. Troponin I: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 48 hours. Myoglobin: The values begin to rise within one to two hours and peak at four to eight hours. Values return to normal within 12-24 hours. Homocysteine: Moderate, intermediate, and severe hyperhomocysteinemia refer to concentrations between 16 and 30, between 31 and 100, and less than 100 micromol/ L, respectively. C-reactive protein Myoglobin is a protein found in both skeletal and myocardial muscle.

It is a proliferation of small ducts and myoepithelial cells near the terminal duct lobular unit. It also is characterized by fibrosis that distos the glands and lobules into a whorled pattern. The demonstration of this on biopsy, as with other proliferative fibrocystic changes, implies an increased risk for subsequent invasive breast cancer. Apocrine metaplasia is the term used to describe a transformation of ductal epithelial cells to eosinophilic cells resembling apocrine sweat gland epithelium. This is a benign, common, non-proliferative change that is not associated with increased cancer risk. A blue-domed cyst of Bloodgood is a fluid-filled cyst, sometimes up to 5 cm in size, that appears blue grossly before it is incised. When incised, the fluid is serous and dark- colored. These cysts are pa of benign non-proliferative fibrocystic disease and do not carry increased cancer risk. Duct ectasia is characterized by a large dilated duct with inspissated material. it is associated with periductal inflammation and fibrosis of the large collecting ducts under the areola. It is common in elderly women, although the cause is not clear. There is no increased risk of cancer. Ref: Wyatt C., Kemp W. L., Moos P. J., Burns D. K., Brown T. G. (2008). Chapter 17.

        "exp": "Germ line mosaicism In some autosomal dominant disorders examplifled by osteogenesis imperfecta, phenotypically normal parents have more than one affected child. - This clearly violates the law of inheritance. Studies indicate that gonadal mosaicism may be responsible for such unusual inheritance. Mosaicism It means than an individual has 2 or more different cell lines derived from a single Zygote. - The persons body' is made up of a combination of cells with and without mutation for a paicular disease. - Because the mutation remains limited to a small poion of all of the body's cells, these individuals show no sign of the disease. Germline mosaicism Germline mosacism results from a mutation that occurs postzygotically during early embryonic development. In these a poion of the egg or sperm cells of a parent carries the mutation. - Because the mutation affects only cells destined to form the gonads the gametes carry the mutation but somatic cells of the individual are completely normal. - A phenotypically normal parent who has germ line mosaicism can transmit the disease causing mutation to the offspring through the mutant gamete. - Because the progenitor cells of the gamete carry the mutation there is a definite possibility that more than one child of such a parent would be affected. - Obviously, the likelihood of such an occurrence depends on the propoion of germ cells carrying the mutation. Anticipation The signs and symptoms of some genetic conditions tend to become severe and appear at an earlier age as the disorder is passed from one generation to the next. - This phenomenon is called anticipation. Anticipation is most often seen with ceain genetic disorders of the nervous system such as Huntington's disease, Fragile x-syndrome and myotonic dystrophy. Anticipation typically occurs with disorders that are caused by an unusual type of mutation called a \"trinucleotide repeat expansion\". - A trinucleotide repeat is a sequence of three DNA building blocks (nucleotide) that is repeated a number of times in a row. - DNA segments with an abnormal number of these repeats are unstable and prone to errors during cell division. - The number of repeats can change as the gene is passed. from parent to child. - If the number of repeats increases it is known as trinucleotide repeat expansion. - In some cases the trinucleotide repeat may expand until the gene stops functioning normally,. - This expansion causes the feature of some disorders to become severe with each successive generation. Genomic imprinting People inherit two copies of their genes - one from their. father and one from their mother. Usually both copies of each gene are active or \"turned on\" in cells. But with genomic imprinting however, only one of the two copies is normally turned on. Which copy is active depends upon the parent of origin. Some genes are normally active only when they are inherited. from a person's. father, others are active only when inherited from a person's mother. These genes are called \"imprinted genes\" because the gene was epigenetically silenced or marked in either the egg or sperm. Silencing or imprinting usually happens through the addition of methyl groups during egg or sperm formation. An individual normally has one active copy of an imprinting gene. Improper imprinting can result in individual having two active copies or two inactive copies. - This can lead to severe developmental anomalies, cancer and other problems e. g., - Prader willi - Angelman syndrome - They are both linked to same imprinting region of chromosomes 15.",

Panacinar (or panlobular) emphysema:- The entire respiratory acinus, from respiratory bronchiole to alveoli, is expanded.- Occurs more commonly in the lower lobes, especially basal segments, and anterior margins of the lungs. Centriacinar (or centrilobular) emphysema:- The respiratory bronchiole (proximal and central pa of the acinus) is expanded.- The distal acinus or alveoli are unchanged.- Occurs more commonly in the upper lobes. Other types include distal acinar and irregular. A special type is congenital lobar emphysema (CLE). The majority of all emphysema cases are caused by smoking tobacco. Severe cases of A1. AD may also develop cirrhosis of the liver, where the accumulated A1. AT leads to a fibrotic reaction. Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1. AD) are more likely to suffer from emphysema. A1. AT inhibits inflammatory enzymes (such as elastase) from destroying the alveolar tissue. Most A1. AD patients do not develop clinically significant emphysema, but smoking and severely decreased A1. AT levels (10-15%) can cause emphysema at a young age. The type of emphysema caused by A1. AD is known as panacinar emphysema (involving the entire acinus) as opposed to centrilobular emphysema, which is caused by smoking. Panacinar emphysema typically affects the lower lungs, while centrilobular emphysema affects the upper lungs. A1. AD causes about 2% of all emphysema. Smokers with A1. AD are at the greatest risk for emphysema. Mild emphysema can often develop into a severe case over a sho period of time (1-2 weeks).",

Cells generate energy by reducing molecular oxygen to water. During this process small amounts of paially reduced reactive oxygen forms are produced as a byproduct of respiration. They are called free radicals or reactive oxygen species. Free radicals are chemical species that have single unpaired electron in an outer orbit. This makes them highly reactive. Free radicals are devastating for the cell as they damage lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Examples of free radical or reactive oxygen species Superoxide 02- Hydroxyl radical OH? Hydrogen peroxide (H202) The noxious effect of free radicals on various cellular material is being utilized by neutrophils to kill bacterias or other microorganisms. Once the neutrophils phagocytize the bacterias there is rapid respiratory burst in the neutrophils which leads to increased oxygen consumption, glycogenolysis and increased glucose oxidation. These reactions lead to rapid burst of superoxide (and other. free radical) production as a by product of the oxidation. This rapid burst in oxidative respiration is made possible by the rapid activation of an enzyme complex, NADPH oxidase, which oxidizes NADPH and in the process reduces oxygen to superoxide anion (024 NADPH oxidase is an enzyme complex that consists of at least seven proteins. The enzyme consists of two complex? a) Membrane complex b) Cytosolic complex In resting neutrophils various components of this enzyme complex is located in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. When the neutrophils are activated the enzyme complex shifts to the phagosomal membrane. The H202generated by the NADPH oxidase system is generally not able to efficiently kill microbes by itself However, azurophilic granules of neutrophils release the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) which in presence of halides such as Cl- conves 11202 to HOCL. The latter is a potent antimicrobial agent that destroys microbes by halogenation. The H202 - MPO halide system is the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils.",

It is the most reliable feature of malignancy. o With few exceptions, all cancer metastatize. The major exceptions are glioma of CNS and basal cell carcinoma of skin, But both of these are locally invasive. Local invasion The malignant tumors progressively infiltrate and destroy the surrounding tissue and tumor cells move beyond the normal confins a process that is called local invasion. Due to local invasion, malignant tumors are poorly demarcated from the surrounding normal tissue and a well? defined cleavage plane is lacking that makes their surgical resection difficult, and even if tumor appears well circumscribed, it is necessory to remove a considerable margin of apperently normal tissues adjacent to the neoplasm. ) After metastasis, it is the most reliable feature of malignancy.",

Enlargement of airspaces without destruction of their walls is termed overinflation, for example, the distention of airspaces that occurs in the remaining lung after unilateral pneumonectomy. Types of emphysema Emphysema is classified according to its anatomic distribution within the lobule. There are four major types of emphysema? 1. Centriacinar (centrilobular) emphysema Centriacinar emphysema is the most common type of emphysema seen clinically. It is chracterized by involvement of respiratory bronchioles, i. e. central (proximal) pa of the acinus. So, both emphysematous and normal airspaces exist within the same acinus and lobule. The lesions are more common and more severe in the upper lobe, paicularly in the apical segments. This is the type of emphysema that occurs predominantly in heavy smokers and usually coexists with chronic bronchitis. 2. Panacinar (Panlobular) emphysema The acini are uniformly enlarged from the level of the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli. This type of emphysema tends to occur more commonly in the lower zones and in the anterior margins of the lung, and it is usually most severe at the base. This type of emphysema is associated with al-antitrypsin deficiency. 3. Distal acinar (Paraseptal) emphysema This type of emphysema involves distal pa of the acinus, while proximal pa is normal. It is localized adjacent to the pleura, along perilobular septa. The involvement is seen adjacent to areas of fibrosis, scarring, or atelectasis and is usually more severe in the upper half of lungs. This type of emphysema is a common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults. 4. Irregular emphysema (Para-cicatricial emphysema) The acinus is involved irregularly and is almost invariably associated with scarring. It is the most common type of emphysema histologically. Most common type of emphysema is irregular emphysema, but it is not clinically significant as most patients are asymptomatic and it is only an autopsy finding. Most common type of emphysema seen clinically is centracinar emphysema.",

Histamine's effect on small vessels results in efflux of plasma protein and fluid into the extracellular spaces and an increase lymph flow, causing edema. The gaps between endothelial cells also may permit passage of circulating cells recruited to tissues during the mast cell response. In the epidermis, it causes itch; in the dermis, it evokes pain, sometimes accompanied by itching. Also know: Triple Response of Lewis: If histamine is injected intradermally, it elicits a characteristic phenomenon known as the triple response. This consists of: A localized red spot within a few seconds and reaches a maximum in 1 minute. A brighter red flush, or \"flare, \" extending around 1 cm developing more slowly. A wheal that is discernible in 1-2 minutes. The initial red spot results from the direct vasodilating effect of histamine (H1 receptor-mediated NO production). The flare is due to histamine-induced stimulation of axon reflexes that cause vasodilation indirectly. The wheal reflects histamine's capacity to increase capillary permeability (edema formation).

All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production. The gross hematuria resolves after a few days, though microscopic hematuria may persist.

TnT) and cardiac specific Troponin I (c. TnI) have amino acid sequences different from those of the skeletal muscle forms of these proteins. o This allows detection of cardiac specific Troponin c TnT and c TnI with highly specific monoclonal antibodies in cardiac diseases. o c. TnT and c. TnI are not normally detectable in the blood of healthy individuals but increase after AMI to levels over 20 times higher than cut off values. o Therefore the measurement of c. TnT and c. TnI is of considerable diagnostic value in a case of acute M. I. o After acute MI both c. TnT and c. TnI arise at about the same time as CK-MB i. e., at 2-4 hrs. Levels of c. TnI remain elevated for 7-10 days after AMI Levels of c. TnT remains elevated for 10-14 days after AMIo In acute stages of M. I. the diagnostic sensitivity of Troponin is equal to that of CKMB. o Troponin T & I can be detected even in cases of small MI when CPK-MB is not detectable. o Therefore measurement of Troponin level is now thepreferred method for the serum marker detection for MI",

(iii) HbH disease o Three genes of a-globin chain are deleted. o With only one gene, the synthesis of a-chain is markedly reduced and tetramers of excess 0-globin, called HbH, form. o HbH has extremely high affinity for oxygen and therefore is not useful for oxygen exchange, leading to tissue hypoxia dispropoionate to the level of hemoglobin. o Patients have moderate to severe anemia that may require occasional blood transfusion. (iv) Hydrops fetalis o Deletion of all four a-globin genes. o In the fetus, excess It-globin chains form tetramers, known as hemoglobin Bas. o Hemoglobin Ba has such a high affinity for oxygen that it delivers almost no oxygen to tissues. o Most individuals die before or sholy after bih. o In utero blood transfusion have allowed the bih of children with hydrops fetalis who then require lifelong blood transfusion.",
