The rapid burst occurs due to rapid activation of the enzyme complex NADPH oxidase which oxidizes NADPH and in the process reduces oxygen to superoxide anion (0,-). It catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion which is then conveed to hydrogen peroxide and other toxic oxygen products (011-) (free radicals). H.,02 then combines with myeloperoxidase and halide to form an effective antibacterial compound. (HOCC-) Chronic granulomatous disorder Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder of phagocytes. Patients suffering from chronic granulomatous disease have leucocytes that ingest microbes normally but lack the fully functional NADPH oxidase system, required to produce the superoxide anion. In these patients there is no respiratory burst due to lack of one of the four NADPH oxidase subunits in neutrophils. Thus, these patients are not able to generate superoxide, H202 and OH- ions (free radicals). (Thus the), are not able to kill the bacterias). Leucocytes from the patients of chronic granulomatous disease fail to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium during phagocytosis. This propey has been used as a screening method for the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease. More on chronic granulomatous disease:- Inheritence - X linked (more common) - Autosomal recessive There is increased incidence of bacterial infection. The bacterias involved in recurrent infections are catalase positive pyogenic pathogens such as staphylococci and colifonns. Catalase negative pathogens are handled normally There is excessive inflammation with granuloma formation.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Early transient increase in permeability Increased vascular permeability o The hallmark of acute inflammation is increased vascular permeability The following mechanisms have ben proposed for increased permeability. i) Formation of endothelial gaps in venules (immediate transient response) This is the most common mechanism of vascular leakage and is caused due to the mediators such as histamine, bradykinin, leukotrienes, neuropeptide sustance Classically this type of leakage affects venules, leaving capillaries and aerioles unaffected. The precise reason for this restriction to venules is unceain, it may be because there is greater density of receptors for mediators in venular endothelium. Binding of mediators such as histamine to their receptors on endothelial cells activate intracellular signaling pathways that lead to phosphorylation of contractile and cytoskeletal proteins such as myosin. These proteins contract leading to contraction of endothelial cells and separation of intercellularjunction. Thus the gaps in the vascular endothelium are largely intercellular or close to the intercellular junctions. This type of leakage occurs rapidly after exposure to the mediator and is usually reversible and sho lived (15-30 minutes), it is thus known as immediate transient response. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon y also increase vascular permeability by inducing a structural reorganization of the cytoskeleton such that the endothelial cells retract from one another. In contrast to the histamine effect, the cytokine induced response is somewhat delayed (4-6 hrs) and long lived (24 hrs or more). Direct endothelial injury resulting in endothelial cell necrosis and detachment (immediate sustained response) This effect is usually encountered in necrotizing injuries and is due to direct damage to the endothelium by injurious stimulus e.g severe burns or lytic infections. The reaction is known as immediate sustained response because the leakage stas immediately after the injury and is sustained at high levels for several hours until the damaged vessels are thrombosed or repaired. o All levels of microcirculation are affected including venules, capillaries and aerioles. iii) Delayed prolonged leakage This is curious but relatively common type of increased permeability that begins after a delay of 2-12 hours, lasts for several hours or even days and involves venules as well as capillaries. This type of leakage is caused by mild to moderate thermal injury, X-ray radiation or ultraviolet radiation and ceain bacterial toxins. It is caused either by direct effect of injurious agent or by cytokine mediated endothelial retraction. iv) Leucocyte mediated endothelial injury Leucocytes adhere to endothelium relatively early in inflammation. These leucocytes may be activated releasing toxic oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes which then cause endothelial injury or detachment. This type of leakage affects venules (mostly); pulmonary & glomerular capillaries. v) Increased transcytosis across the endothelial cytoplasm Transcytosis occurs across channels consisting of clusters of interconnected uncoated vesicles and vacuoles called the vesiculovacuolar organelle, many of which are located close to intercellular junctions. It usually occurs in venules. vi) Leakage from new blood vessels During repair formation of new vessels occur (angiogenesis) New vessel sprouts, remain leaky until the endothelial cells mature.",

        "exp": "Ans. is `a' i.e., 25 U/ ml The normal value is less than 35 U/mL 1) Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) It is a glycoprotein produced by fetal gut, pancreas and liver. It is used as tumor marker for colorectal cancer (major use), lung cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. It is also increased in non-neoplastic conditions like alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis, IBD (CD, UC), smoking and pancreatitis. In colorectal cancer it is used for screening; response and follow up after surgery (CEA should diseapper in 6 weeks after resection), prognosis (higher levels suggests high tumor burden) and to see recurrence on follow up. CEA antigen has no correlation with hepatic metastasis. CEA lacks sensitivity as well as specificity, hence cannot be used to confirm the diagnosis. 2) Alpha-feto protein (AFP) It is a glycoprotein synthesized normally early in fetal life by yolk sac, fetal liver and fetal GIT. It is structurally and genetically related to albumin. AFP is raised in liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), lung carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and non-seminoma germ cell tumor of testis/ovary (yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor, embryonal carcinoma, teratoma). AFP is also raised in some non-neoplastic conditions like cirrhosis, hepatitis, and pregnancy. 3) Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) It is a placental hormone synthesized by syncytiotrophoblasts. It is glycoprotein with two subunits (dimer) : a-subunit and /3-subunit. But only the P subunit of HCG is typically measured as a tumour marker because of specificity of the 13 subunit. The i3 subunit of HCG has unique sequences that are not shared with other human glycoprotein hormones. It is detected by radioimmunoassay using antibodies to the 13 chain. a-HCG is not used as tumour marker because a unit of the FSH, LH and TSH are identical. So there can be cross reactivity between a subunits of these hormone. That is why in case of testicular tumours the patients also undergo simultaneous assay of LH to be ceain that the marker detected is 13 HCG. HCG (13-HCG) is raised in gestational trophoblastic disease (hydatidiform moles), gonadal germ cell tumor (embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma), and pregnancy. 4) CA-125 Most impoant cancer with elevated CA-125 is epithelial ovarian cancer. CA-125 is also elevated in cancers of endometrium, cervix, fallopian tubes, pancreas, breast, lung and colon. Non-neoplastic conditions causing elevation of CA-125 are pregnancy, mensturation, endometriosis, PID, abdominal TB, peritonitis and uterine fibroid.

Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include blebbing, loss of cell membrane asymmetry and attachment, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis differs from necrosis, in which the cellular debris can damage the organism. Apoptosis in physiological conditions: - During embryogenesis - Involution of hormone-dependent tissues upon hormone withdrawl, such as endometrial cell breakdown during menstrual cycle, ovarian follicular atresia in menopause etc. - Cell loss in proliferating cell populations, such as immature lymphocytes in the bone marrow.

Acute GVHD :-Acute GVHD occurs within 100 days (usually 10-50 days) of bone marrow transplantation. The manifestations of acute GVHD are:? 1. Skin o The most common tissue affected in acute GVHD is the skin, with over 80% of patients with GVHD manifesting skin eruption. o The typical skin presentation consists of a maculopapular rash that can resemble a sunburn. o Histological findings are:- (i) Perivascular mononuclear infiltrates (ii) Vacuolar degradation of dermo-epidermal junction (iii) Dyskeratotic cells or eosinophilic bodies in the epidermis (iv) Epidermolysis & bullae (v) Denudation of epidermis (separation of epidermis from dermis) 2. Gut J The primary clinical manifestation of gut GVHD is diarrhea and abdominal pain. o There is lymphocytic infiltrates at the crypts with accompnied necrosis and dropout of crypt cells. 3. Liver o Lymphocytic infiltrates in the interlobular and marginal bile ducts are characteristic histopathologic findings. o This results in hepatitis with necrosis of hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells o There is inflammation of the parenchyma and poal tracts. o These findings lead to clinically identifiable cholestatic picture. B. Chronic GVHD :- It occurs after 100 days of bone marrow transplantation. Manifestations are :1.Skin o Extensive cutaneous injury, with destruction of skin appendages and fibrosis of the dermis. Gut o Damage to GIT may result in necrosis, ulceration, fibrosis and strictures. Liver o The findings of liver damage are :? (i) Poal tract inflammation (ii) Selective bile duct destruction (iii) Endothelitis of poal vein and hepatic vein radicles, in which a subendothelial lymphocytic infiltrate lifts the endothelium from its basement membrane. (iv) Intrahepatic cholestasis Role of liver biopsy in GVHD o Evaluation of liver biopsies in the setting of acute GVHD is usually not required, because skin or GI tract biopsies are usually sufficient to establish a diagnosis and the risks associated with liver biopsy in the early post-operative period are unacceptably high. However, because abnormal liver function tests often persist despite improvement in other organs after treatment, liver biopsy may be needed to exclude coexistent disease such as viral infection. Therefore, in acute GVHD liver biopsy contributes an impoant role in the exclusion of other causes of hepatic injury. o In contrast, liver biopsy is an impoant diagnostic test in establishing a diagnosis of chronic GVHD after bone marrow transplantation.",

This\u00a0protein plays a role in transport of materials into lysosomes.\nLysosomes contain several enzymes. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down\u00a0several toxins.\nDuring phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming a phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are\u00a0formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias.\nMutation\u00a0in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function\u00a0of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot\u00a0fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome. Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired\u00a0bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation.\nAs a result, most people with the chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, starting\u00a0in infancy or early childhood. These infections\u00a0are life-threatening,\nBesides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also\u00a0affected.\nThe other cells involved are - Melanosomes of melanocytes, Dense bodies of platelets, Granules of\u00a0Schwann cells.\nThere are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells.\nIn pigment cells called melanocytes, the melanosome becomes abnormally large so there is reduced\u00a0production\u00a0of melanin. Thus people with Chediak Higashi syndrome have oculocutaneous albinism i.e\u00a0the colour of skin, hair and eye is reduced.\u00a0\nAbnormality in platelets produces bleeding disorders.\nDefective\u00a0in platelets produce bleeding disorders.\nDefective\u00a0granules in Schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e.g. peripheral neuropathy,\nMost children with Chediak\u00a0Higashi syndrome ultimately\u00a0reach a stage of the disorder known as\u00a0accelerated phase, (lymphoma-like a stage).\nThis severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection\u00a0(E.B.virus). In the\u00a0accelerated phase, defective\u00a0white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's\u00a0organs.\nThe accelerated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections\u00a0and organ failure.

        "exp": "The myelin sheath is formed by oligodendrocytes in CNS and by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The gaps formed between myelin sheath cells along the axons are called nodes of Ranvier. Since the lipid structure of myelin serves as a good insulator, the myelin sheaths increase the rate of propagation and efficacy of transmission of the impulse along the axon. The electrical impulse jumps from one node to the next at the rate as fast as 120 m/s. This rapid type of conduction is called saltatory conduction. Demyelination can occur early in life as consequence of congenital metabolic disorders. Demyelination later in life can be repaired with glia, which explains the frequent exacerbations and remissions in MS. It is believed that in MS, multiple mechanisms of immune injury of myelin coexist: cytokine-mediated injury of oligodendrocytes and myelin, digestion of surface myelin antigens by macrophages, complement-mediated injury, and direct injury by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This type of injury causes the loss of saltatory conduction in nerve fibers. The exposed axon is susceptible to fuher injury, resulting in irreversible axonal damage. Glial cells do not carry action potentials, but they have many impoant functions. There are several types of glial cells: astrocytes, which transpo nutrients to neurons, hold neurons in place, digest pas of dead neurons, and regulate the composition of extracellular space, and microglia, which possess phagocytic function, clean up debris, and protect the brain from microorganisms.Ependymal cells form the epithelial lining of the ventricle.

Stomach cancers are commonly adenocarcinomas (90%). Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (\"back to back\" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically \"empty\" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumor cell, it pushes the nucleus at the purpley\"signet-ring cell\".

Opsonized platelets are rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system.\nThe spleen is the major site of the destruction of platelets.\n\nPathology\n\nThe principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic.\nThe point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in the spleen, the spleen size remains normal. \nOn histological examination, there is congestion of the sinusoids and hyperactivity and enlargement of the splenic follicles manifested by the formation of prominent germinal centres. Sometimes scattered megakaryocytes are found within the sinuses and sinusoidal walls. This represents a very mild form of extramedullary hematopoiesis. These splenic findings are not sufficiently distinctive to be considered diagnostic.\n\nBone Marrow\n\nBone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes.\nThese findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction.\nThe importance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure.\nA decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I.T.P.",

Whether regeneration occurs depends uponi) Regenerative capacity of the involved cell (i.e., their ability to divide)ii) The no. of surviving ble cellsiii) Presence of connective tissue framework that will provide the base for restoration of normal tissue structure. C.Repair by scar formation A scar is a mass of collagen that is the end result of repair by organization and fibrosis. Repair by scar formation occurs when.i) Resolution fails to occurs in an acute inflammatory responseii) When there is ongoing tissue necrosis in chronic inflammation.When parenchymal cells necrosis cannot be repaired by regeneration.",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Medullary carcinoma of thyroid MEN-1/Wermer syndrome is characterized by abnormalities involving the parathyroid, pancreas and pituitary gland; thus the mnemonic device, the 3P's. Parathyroid-Hyperparathyroidism is present in 80-95% of patients. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is the most common manifestation: about 25% of patients have evidence of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. In contrast to sporadic cases of hyperparathyroidism, diffuse hyperplasia or multiple adenomas are more common than solitary adenomas. Pancreas-Pancreatic islet cell tumors occur in 60 to 70% of patients. Tumors are usually multicentric. Multiple adenomas or diffuse islet cell hyperplasia commonly occurs; such tumors may arise from the small bowel rather than the pancreas. About 30% of tumors are malignant and have local or distant metastases. Malignant islet cell tumors due to MEN 1 syndrome often have a more benign course than do sporadically occurring malignant islet cell tumors. About 40% of islet cell tumors originate from a beta cell, secrete insulin (insulinoma), and can cause fasting hypoglycemia. Beta-Cell tumors are more common in patients < 40. About 60% of islet cell tumors originate from nonbeta-cell elements and tend to occur in patients > 40. Non-beta-cell tumors are somewhat more likely to be malignant Pituitary-Pituitary tumors occur in 15 to 42% of MEN 1 patients. From 25 to 90% are prolactinomas. About 25% of pituitary tumors secrete growth hormone or growth hormone and prolactin. Excess prolactin may cause galactorrhea and excess growth hormone causes acromegaly clinically indistinguishable from sporadically occurring acromegaly. About 3% of tumors secrete ACTH, producing Cushing's disease. Most of the remainder are nonfunctional.",

D: Affects T-cellsB-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)/chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), is the most common type of leukemia of the adults.CLL affects B cell lymphocytes.B cells originate in the bone marrow, develop in the lymph nodes, and normally fight infection by producing antibodies. In CLL, the DNA of a B cell is damaged, so that it can't produce antibodies. Additionally, B cells grow out of control and accumulate in the bone marrow and blood, where they crowd out healthy blood cells.Most (>75%) people newly diagnosed with CLL are over the age of 55, and the majority are men.Most people are diagnosed without symptoms as the result of a routine blood test that returns a high white blood cell count, but, as it advances, CLL results in swollen lymph nodes, spleen, and liver, and eventually anemia and infections. DNA analysis has distinguished two major types of CLL, with different survival times.CLL that is positive for the marker ZAP-70 has an average survival of 5 years.CLL that is negative for ZAP-70 has an average survival of more than 25 years.",

        "exp": "Aortic dissection \n\nAortic dissection is a catastrophic illness characterized by dissection of blood between and along the laminar planes of aortic media.\nBlood enters inside the arterial wall (in the media layer) and leads to the formation of blood-filled channels within the aortic wall, which often ruptures outward causing massive haemorrhage.\nThe most frequent pre-existing histologically detectable lesion is cystic medial degeneration.\nIn aortic dissection, there is an intimial tear through which the blood enters into the media.\nUsually, the tear is within 10 cms of the aortic valve.\nThe dissecting hematoma spreads characteristically along the laminar planes of the aorta, usually between the middle and outer third.\nSome times, blood ruptures into the lumen distally, i.e. there is the second tear distally. So that a complete new vascular channel is formed inside the media of aortic wall. Blood enters from proximal tear into the media and comes out into the lumen from the distal tear.\nThis is called double - barrel aorta with a false-channel in the media.\nLater on, this false channel becomes endothelized \u2192 chronic dissection.\n\n\u00a0 Classification of Aortic dissection\n\nThe risk and nature of serious complications of dissection depend strongly on the level of aorta affected, with the most serious complications occurring from the aortic valve to the arch.\nThus aortic dissections are generally classified into two types -\n\n1. Proximal lesion (Type A)\n\nMore common and more dangerous.\nInvolve either the ascending portion only or both ascending and the descending portion of aorta.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Distal lesion (Type B)\n\nInvolve only descending part distal to the subclavian artery.",

INFARCTION An infarct is an area of ischemic necrosis by occlusion of either the aerial supply or venous drainage in a paicular tissue. Pathogenesis Mostly it is caused by interrupted blood supply. \"Nearly 99% of all infarcts results from thrombotic or embolic events and almost all result from aerial occlusion\". Other causes of interrupted aerial supply are local vasospasm, extrinsic compression of a vessel by tumor, twisting of vessel e.g., in testicular torsion, expansion of atheroma due to hemorrhage within the plaque. Venous obstruction usually cause congesion, edema, infarction does not occur because bypass channels rapidly open after the thrombus, providing some outflow from the area, which inturn improves aerial inflow. Infarct cause by venous thrombosis is more likely in organs with a single venous outflow channel, such as in testis and ovary. Types of infarct Infarcts are classified on the basis of their color. Infarcts are classified into either Red (Haemorrhagic) or White or Pale (anaemic) infarcts, reflecting the amount of haemorrhage. Red infarcts (Haemorrhagic) : occur with : Venous occlusions (eg ovarian torsion); In loose tissues (such as lungs); In tissues with dual circulation (e.g. Lung & S. intestine) In tissues that were previously congested because of sluggish venous out flow. When flow is reestablilshed to a site of previous aerial occulusion and necrosis.

In patients with adequate cardiovascular function, the bronchial aerial supply can often sustain the lung parenchyma despite obstruction to the pulmonary aerial system. Pulmonary embolism usually cause infarction only when the circulation is already inadequate as in patients with hea or lung disease. For this reason, pulmonary infarcts tend to be uncommon in the young. Consequences of pulmonary embolism o The effects of pulmonary embolism depend mainly on the size of the occluded vessel, the number of emboli, and on cardiovascular status of the patients. o The following consequences can result. Asymptomatic o Most pulmonary emboli (60% to 80%) are clinically silent because they are small. o With time, they undergo organization and are incorporated into the vascular wall. Sudden death (cardiovascular collapse) o Massive pulmonary embolism may result in instantaneous death, without occurence of chest pain and dyspnea. Acute cor pulmonale (Acute right hea failure) o Numerus small emboli may obstruct most of the pulmonary circulation resulting in acute hea failure. Pulmonary infarction o Embolic obstruction of small end-aeriolar pulmonary branches can cause pulmonary infarction. o About three fouhs of all infarcts affect the lower lobes, and in more than half, multiple lesions occur. o Characteristically, they extend to the periphery of the lung substance as a wedge with apex pointing toward the hilus of the lung. o The pulmonary infarct is classically hemorrhagic infarct. Pulmonary hemorrhage o Embolic obstruction of medium-sized aeries may result in pulmonary hemorrhage. Pulmonary hypeension o Multiple emboli over time may cause pulmonary hypeension with right hea failure. o For this reason, pulmonary infarcts tend to be uncommon in the young.

These two blood groups do not have the 'B' antigen on the RBCs)o This is not the case with other blood groups. Preformed antibodies are not present. They are formed only after an exposure to the antigen, for example Rh negative person do not have anti- Rh antibodies, these antibodies are formed only after an exposure to Rh positive blood (by a blood transfusion, i.e. this makes the first blood transfusion safe even if mismathced)o These preformed antibodies, rapidly destroy the RBCs of any mismatched blood transfusion.o Read the following lines from the Journal of hematology?\"In clinical transfusion practice, the ABO blood groups are the most impoant and can never be ignored in red cell transfusion, because individials who genetically lack any antigen, have antibodies against the red cell types that they have not inherited. These antibodies can destroy red cells rapidly in circulation\".",

Several techniques are used to detect ANAs. Clinically the most widely used method is indirect immunofluorescence. The pattern of fluorescence suggests the type of antibody present in the patient's serum. ANA screening yields positive results in many connective tissue disorders and other autoimmune diseases, and may occur in normal individuals. Subtypes of antinuclear antibodies include anti-Smith and anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies (which are linked to SLE) and anti-histone antibodies (which are linked to drug-induced lupus). Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE; they are present in 70% of cases, whereas they appear in only 0.5% of people without SLE.

The diagnosis of ALL is made by bone marrow examination, which shows a homogeneous infiltration of leukemic blasts replacing normal marrow elements. Two most impoant prognostic features are WBC count and age. Children less than one year of age have a very poor prognosis. Infant leukemia is often associated with a genetic abnormality t(4;11) translocation and has high WBC count. Children aged 1-9 years have good prognosis. WBC count more than 50,000/L at diagnosis is associated with a poor prognosis. Cure rates depend on specific prognostic features present at diagnosis, biologic features of the leukemic blast, and the response to therapy.

MCV will be decreased in microcytic anemia, and will be increased in macrocytic (megaloblastic anemia). Mean cell hemoglobin (MCH1 o The average content of hemoglobin per red blood cell in picograms. Normal value is 27-33 pg. o MCH will be decreased in hypochromic (microcytic hypochromic anemia), and will be increased in megaloblastic anemia. Mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) o The average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of packed red blood cells, expressed in grams per deciliter. Normal value is 33-37 gm/dl. MCHC is increased in hereditary spherocytosis, not because of increased hemoglobin, but due to decerase volume of spherocytes. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) o The cofficient of variation of red blood cell volume, i.e. degree of anisocytosis (abnormal variation in size of RBCs). Normal value is 11.5 - 14.5. Hematocrit or Packed cell volume (PCV1 The propoion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells. Normal values are about 45% for men and about 42% for women. o A decrease in the number or size of red cells also decreases the amount of space they occupy, resulting in lower hematocrit. Similarly an increase in the number or size of red cells increases hematocrit. Exceptions are thalassemia which can cause an increased number of red blood cells but a decreased size and hematocrit, and megaloblastic anemia which causes increase in size of red cells with decreased hematocrit. Reticulocyte count ---->quantitative measure of the bone marrow's production of new red blood cells. Reticulocyte count is increased in anemia due to blood loss or anemia in which there is no defect in RBC production --> It is a responce to componsate anemia. o Reticulocyte count is decreased when there is anemia which has defect in RBC production, e.g. macrocytic (Vit B 12, folic acid deficiency) anemia, microcytic (iron def. anemia), Aplastic anemia.",

It is generally an idiopathic condition, probably related to pubeal hormonal changes. Fibrocystic changes in the breast, which reflect physiological responses in the breast to cyclical levels of sex hormones, are not observed in men. Fibrocystic changes are most common in the late reproductive years and include fibrosis, cyst formation, and a variety of epithelial changes such as hyperplasia and apocrine metaplasia. Intraductal papillomas are benign neoplasms commonly evolving in the major lactiferous ducts beneath the nipple. They most commonly present with a bloody nipple discharge and are rare in men. Carcinoma of the male breast is rare, and almost always develops in the breasts of elderly men. Male breast carcinomas have a somewhat worse prognosis than their female counterpa.

However, the capillaries in the subcutaneous fat are aften involved in patients with systemic amyloidosis and can often provide sufficient tissues for the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Therefore, a needle aspiration biopsy of fat just under the skin of the belly (fat pad aspiration) offers a simple and less invasive method to diagnose systemic amyloidosis and biopsy of the organ with the most severe clinical involvement is often unnecessary. When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a final diagnosis, biopsy samples can be collected from other organs. The best sites of biopsy are abdominal fat pad (90% sensitivity) and rectal mucosa (70-80% sensitivity). Other sites are salivary glands, gingiva, skin, tongue, bone marrow, stomach.",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Prostatic carcinomaAn elevated level of a tumor marker can indicate cancer; however, there can also be other causes of the elevation.Tumor markers can be produced directly by the tumor or by non-tumor cells as a response to the presence of a tumor. As used in oncology, they are as follows:- Screening for common cancers on a population basisExample: elevated prostate specific antigen suggests prostate cancer.- Monitoring of cancer survivors after treatmentExample: elevated AFP in a child previously treated for teratoma suggests relapse with endodermal sinus tumor.- Diagnosis of specific tumor types, paicularly in ceain brain tumors and other instances where biopsy is not feasible.Tumor markers can be classified in two groups: Cancer-specific markers and tissue-specific markers.- Cancer-specific markers:An example of a cancer-specific marker, CEA, or carcinoembryonic antigen, is a blood-borne protein, first noted to be produced by tumors of the gastrointestinal system. Fuher investigation showed that it was produced by the occasional lung and breast cancer case, meaning that an elevated level does not mean a bowel cancer. However, in a patient with a history of a treated bowel cancer, a rising CEA level can be an early sign of bowel cancer return.A sequence of steady low CEA readings can provide much needed reassurance to the post-operative patient. Also, a rising sequence of CEA readings should ale the physician to the need for diagnostic tests such as PET scans.- Tissue-specific markers:Tissue-specific markers are related to specific tissues which have developed cancer.Generally speaking, these substances are not specifically related to the tumor, and may be present at elevated levels when no cancer is present.Examples include PSA, beta-HCG - (Human chorionic gonadotropin), AFP - (Alpha-fetoprotein), AFP-L3 - (a lectin-reactive AFP) and Thyroglobulin.For example, if man has an elevated PSA, a search for prostate cancer will be undeaken.If an individual has an elevated level of beta-HCG, AFP or AFP-L3%, a search for a testicular or liver cancer, respectively, will be made.PSA (Prostate specific antigen) is produced by the normal prostate.It is a protein enzyme called a serine protease that usually acts as an anticoagulant to keep semen liquid. Only small amounts leak into the circulation in normal circumstances.Enlarged prostates leak more substantial amounts, and cancerous prostates also leak substantial amounts. o Beta-hCG: Elevated levels cannot prove the presence of a tumor, and low levels do not rule it out (an exception is in males who do not naturally produce beta-hCG).Neveheless, elevated beta-hCG levels fall after successful treatment (e.g. surgical intervention or chemotherapy) and a recurrence can often be detected by the finding of rising levels.",

        "question": "Sweat chloride in cystic fibrosis ?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Increased CYSTIC FIBROSIS Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease of the mucus and sweat glands. Cystic fibrosis follows on autosomal recessive transmission. There is a defect in ion transpo of epithelial cells that affects fluid secretion in Exocrine glands (pancreas) Epithelial lining of respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tract. Pathophysiologv In normal duct epithelia, chloride is transpoed by plasma membrane channels (chloride channels) The primary defect in cystic fibrosis results from abnormal function of an epithelial chloride channel protein encoded by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7q 31.2. Protein encoded by CFTR is a chloride channel through which chloride passes In cystic fibrosis activity of chloride channel is decreased. Along with chloride channel, CFTR can regulate other channel also, for example epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). ENaC is inhibited by normally functioning CFTR; hence, in cystic fibrosis, ENaC activity increases, markedly augmenting sodium uptake across the apical membrane (especially in respiratory and gastrointestinal system). Normal CFTR gene product Defective (mutated) Crl R gene product in cystic fibrosis Induce Cl- conductance through itself (chloride channel) Reduced or lost Cl conductance Inhibits Na+ conductance through Augmented sodium uptake across apical membrane ENaC Clinical features of CF Functions of CFTR are tissue specific, i.e. its functions signify whether the epithelium is secretory (secrete Cl- into lumen) or absorptive (reabsorb Cl- from lumen). Therefore clinical features are tissue specific: Respiratory tract Respiratory epithelium is secretory, i.e. there is active secretion of C1-. CFTR mutation in cystic fibrosis results in loss or reduction of chloride secretion in lumen. Active luminal sodium absorption is also increased (due to loss of inhibition of ENaC activity) Both these decreased Cl secretion and increased Na+ absorption from lumen) lead to increased passive water reabsorption (As you all know diffusion of water occurs from high osmolar to low osmolar concentration area). This results in accumulation of dehydraded hyperconcentrated viscid secretion in respiratory lumen and defective mucociliary clearance obstruction and recurrent respiratory tract infection; and bronchiectasis. 1.Intestine Similar to respiratory epithelium, intestinal epithelium is secretory and in CF there is defective Cl- secretion andenhanced Na+ absorption from lumen - Increased passive reabsorption of water from lumen. This results in accumulation of dehydrated desciated intraluminal contents obstruction of small and largeintestine. Pancreas The absence of CFTR Cl channel in the apical membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelium limits the function of an apical membrane Ct -HCHD3 exchanger to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ (by a passive process) into the duct. The failure to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ leads to retention of enzyme in the pancreas and ultimately destruction of all pancreatic tissues due to pancreatitis. Hepatobiliary system Similar to respiratory and intestinal epithelium, defective biliar Cl- and water secretion causes thickened biliary secretions-biliary cirrhosis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis. Sweat glands In contrast to respiratory and intestinal epithelium, sweat gland duct epithelium is absorptive, i.e. function of normal CFTR in the sweat gland ducts is to reabsorb Cl- ions and Na' from lumen. Therefore, in the sweat ducts, loss of CFTR function leads to decreased reabsorption of NaC1- Hypeonic sweat with increased Na+ and Ct in sweat.",

Excess heme groups are catabolized to bilirubin within the mononuclear phagocytic system --> Increased indirect bilirubin and jaundice. LDH is stored in the blood. During hemolysis this enzyme is released in the blood Increased serum LDH.",

A: G-6-PD deficiencyHeinz bodies are inclusions within red blood cells composed of denatured hemoglobin.Heinz bodies are formed by damage to the hemoglobin component molecules, usually through oxidations, or the change of an internal amino acid residue(from an inherited mutation), which causes the damaged molecules to, often degrade and then precipitate, damaging the cell membrane by hydrophobically adsorbing to it thereby increasing cell permeability, leading to premature cell lysis.Damaged cells are attacked by macrophages in the spleen, where the precipitate and damaged membrane are removed, leading to characteristic \"bite cells\". The denaturing process is irreversible and the continual elimination of damaged cells leads to Heinz body anemia.G6PD deficiency brought on by administration of oxidant drugs (e.g., primaquine, dapsone, quinidine) also can result in Heinz bodies.",

Major presentation is bleeding (intestinal bleeding). Pathogenesis of angiodysplasia has been linked to mechanical and congenital factors :? 1. Mechanical factor Normal distension and contraction intermittently occlude submucosal veins and leads to dilatation and touosity of overlying vessels. Because cecum has the largest diameter, it develops the greatest wall tension. Therefore cecum is the most common site for angiodysplasia. 2.

Centriacinar (centrilobular) emphysema o Centriacinar emphysema is the most common type of emphysema seen clinically. o It is chracterized by involvement of respiratory bronchioles, i.e. central (proximal) pa of the acinus. o So, both emphysematous and normal airspaces exist within the same acinus and lobule. o The lesions are more common and more severe in the upper lobe, paicularly in the apical segments. o This is the type of emphysema that occurs predominantly in heavy smokers and usually coexists with chronic bronchitis. Panacinar (Panlobular) emphysema o The acini are uniformly enlarged from the level of the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli. o This type of emphysema tends to occur more commonly in the lower zones and in the anterior margins of the lung, and it is usually most severe at the base. o This type of emphysema is associated with al -antittypsin deficiency. Distal acinar (Paraseptal) emphysema o This type of emphysema involves distal pa of the acinus, while proximal pa is normal. o It is localized adjacent to the pleura, along perilobular septa. o The involvement is seen adjacent to areas of fibrosis, scarring, or atelectasis and is usually more severe in the upper half of lungs. o This type of emphysema is a common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults. 4.Irregular emphysema (Para-cicatricial emphysema) 3 The acinus is involved irregularly and is almost invariably associated with scarring. o It is the most common type of emphysema histologically.

B: Capillary dilation Red reaction or red line in triple reaction is due to dilatation of precapillary sphincters Triple response of Lewis It is a cutaneous response that occurs from firm stroking of the skin, which produces an initial red line, followed by a flare around that line, and then finally a wheal. The triple response of Lewis is due to the release of histamine. Histamine, or 2-(imidazol-4-yl) ethanamine, is a dibasic vasoactive amine that is located in most body tissues but is highly concentrated in the lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Histamine is derived from the decarboxylation of the aminoacid histidine, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme Lhistidine decarboxylase. Histamine is a small molecule, stored as granules in mast cells and basophils. Mast cells and basophils are the effector cells involved in the immediate hypersensitivity response. Explanation :Injected intradermally histamine elicits the triple response consisting of: - Red spot: due to capillary dilation - Flare: redness in the surrounding area due to aeriolar dilatation mediated by axon reflex. - Wheal: due to exudation of fluid from capillaries and venules",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., NADPH oxidase The final step in the microbial killing is due to reactive oxygen species called as respiratory burst. Phagocytes require an enzyme to produce reactive oxygen species to destroy bacteria after they ingest the bacteria in a process called phagocytosis. ROS are produced by the rapid assembly and activation of a multicomponent oxidase, NADPH oxidase and, in the process, reduces oxygen to superoxide anion (02). In neutrophils, this oxidative reaction is triggered by activating signals and accompanies phagocytosis, and is called the respiratory burst.",

Creatine kinaseMB (CK-MB), myoglobin, homocysteine, C-reactive protein (CRP), troponin T (cTnT), and troponin I (cTnI) are all used for assessment of the suspected acute myocardial infarction.CK-MB, cTnT, and cTnI may also be used to identify and manage high-risk patients.Normal results vary, based on the laboratory and method used.Total CK: The values begin to rise within four to six hours and peak at 24 hours. Values return to normal within three to four days.CK-MB: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 24 hours. Values return to normal within 72 hours.Troponin T: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 48 hours.Troponin I: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 48 hours.Myoglobin: The values begin to rise within one to two hours and peak at four to eight hours.

The histocompatibility antigens (human leukocyte antigens - HLA) are cell surface antigens that induce an immune response leading to rejection of allogrufts. The principal physiologic function of the cell surface histocompatibility molecules is to bind peptide fragments of foreign proteins for presentation to antigen specific T cells. The histocompatibility antigens are encoded by a closely linked multiallelic cluster of genes, Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or Human leukocyte antigens complex (HLA complex). - HLA complex of genes is located on the sho arm of chromosome 6. It consists of three separate clusters of genes: HLA Complex [MHC Responses of MHC molecules Class 1 MHC class I molecules bind and process peptide that are derived from proteins synthesized within the cells, e.g. viral protein in viral infected cells and antigen of cancerous cells. These cells (cancerous or virus infected) have a tendency to display unusual, non self antigens on their surface. After binding to MHC-I, these antigens are processed and presented to cytotoxic CD-8 T cells (MHC-I restricted). Cytotoxic CD-8 T cell - MHC I reaction cause -- Graft rejection - Cell mediated cytolysis of viral infected or tumor cells. Class II Class 11 molecules present exogenous antigen (e.g. extracellular microbes, soluble proteins). These antigens are first internalized and undergo proteolytic cleavage in lysosome. Peptide generated .from this proteolytic cleavage are presented by MHC - II to CD4-T cells (MHC-II restricted). Reactions are : - Graft versus host response - Mixed leukocyte reaction Class III \"The MHC class HI region contains many genes that are good candidates for the involvement in autoimmune disease\". Recent data suggest that quantitative and qualitative diversities of the MHC Ill linked C4 among different ethnic groups can be impoant in susceptibility to autoimmune disease like SLE. Note ?
