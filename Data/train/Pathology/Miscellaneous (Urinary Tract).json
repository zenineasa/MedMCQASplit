It is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis in the world. IgA nephropathy is characterized by the accumulation in mesangial areas of immune complexes containing polymeric Ig. A1. The pathogenesis of this disease involves the deposition of polymeric and undergalactosylated Ig. Al in the mesangium. Quantitative and structural changes of IgA 1 play a key role in the development of the disease due to functional abnormalities of two IgA receptors: The Fc alpha R (CD89) expressed by blood myeloid cells and the transferrin receptor 1. CD71) on mesangial cells. Abnormal IgA induce the release of soluble CD89 which is responsible for the formation of circulating IgA complexes. These complexes may be trapped by CD71 that is overexpressed on mesangial cells in IgA nephropathy patients allowing pathogenic IgA complex formation.",

The term diabetic nephropathy is applied to the conglomerate of lesions that occur in the diabetic kidney. Most common lesions involve the glomeruli and are associated clinically with three glomerular syndromes: Non-nephrotic proteinuria. Nephrotic syndrome. Chronic renal failure. Diabetes also affects the arterioles (causing hvalinizing arteriolar sclerosis), increases susceptibility to the development of pyelonephritis and particularly papillary necrosis, and causes a variety of tubular lesions. The morphologic changes in the glomeruli include. Capillary basement membrane thickening. Diffuse mesangia] sclerosis. Nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimme- Istiel-Wilson lesions). The morphology is identical in type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
