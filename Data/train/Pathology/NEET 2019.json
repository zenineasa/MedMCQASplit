        "question": "Which of the following is positive in Follicular lymphoma?",
        "exp": "Follicular lymphoma likely arises from germinal center B cells and is strongly associated with chromosomal translocations involving BCL2. Its hallmark is a (14; 18) translocation that juxtaposes the IGH locus on chromosome 14 and the BCL2 locus on chromosome 18. The t(14; 18) is seen in up to 90% of follicular lymphomas, and leads to overexpression of BCL2. BCL2 antagonizes apoptosis and promotes the survival of follicular lymphoma cells. Notably, while normal germinal centers contain numerous B cells undergoing apoptosis, follicular lymphoma is characteristically devoid of apoptotic cells. BCL 10: associated with extra nodal marginal zone lymphoma The t(14; 18)(q32; q21) and t(1; 14) (p22; q32) translocations cause increased expression of intact MALT1 and BCL-10 protein respectively. This translocation is associated with gastric MALToma. Each of the three translocations has the same net effect, the constitutive activation of NF-kB, a transcription factor that promotes B-cell growth and survival. Antigen dependent activation of NF-kB in normal B and T cells. requires both BCL-10 and MLT, which work together in a pathway downstream of the B- and T-cell antigen receptors. Thus, H. pylori-induced inflammation may trigger NF-kB activation through the MLT/BCL-10 pathway in MALTomas that lack these translocations. Removal of this stimulus may explain why these tumors tend to respond to H. pylori eradication. In contrast, NF-kB is constitutively active in tumors bearing translocations involving MLT or BCL10, and H. pylori treatment is ineffective. BCL 6: associated with diffuse large b cell lymphoma(DLBCL). DLBCL is most common subtype of non Hodgkin lymphoma globally. BCL 1: also called cyclin D1 and is associated with Mantle Cell Lymphoma",

Predictably, inherited deficiency of Gp. IIb-IIIa results in a bleeding disorder called Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Bernard-Soulier syndrome illustrates the consequences of defective adhesion of platelets to subendothelial matrix. Bernard-Soulier syndrome is caused by an inherited deficiency of the platelet membrane glycoprotein Complex Ib-IX. This glycoprotein is a receptor for v. WF and is essential for normal platelet adhesion to the subendothelial extracellular matrix. Affected patients have a variable, often severe, bleeding tendency. Factor VIII and v. WF are encoded by separate genes and are synthesized in different cells. Factor VIII is an essential cofactor of factor IX, which conves factor X to factor Xa. It is made in several tissues; sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells in the liver seem to be major sources.

This pattern of necrosis typically occurs when complexes of antigens and antibodies are deposited in the walls of aeries. Deposits of these \"immune complexes, \" together with fibrin that has leaked out of vessels, result in a bright pink and amorphous appearance in H&E stains, called \"fibrinoid\" (fibrin-like) by pathologists. Seen in Type III hypersensitivity, microscopic polyangiitis, vegetation of Libman Sack Endocarditis, malignant hypertension. Coagulative necrosis is a form of necrosis in which the architecture of dead tissues is preserved for a span of at least some days. The affected tissues exhibit a firm texture. Ischemia caused by obstruction in a vessel may lead to coagulative necrosis of the supplied tissue in all organs except the brain. A localized area of coagulative necrosis is called an infarct. Liquefactive necrosis, in contrast to coagulative necrosis, is characterized by digestion of the dead cells, resulting in transformation of the tissue into a liquid viscous mass. It is seen in focal bacterial or, occasionally, fungal infections, because microbes stimulate the accumulation of leukocytes and the liberation of enzymes from these cells. \\The necrotic material is frequently creamy yellow because of the presence of dead leukocytes and is called pus. For unknown reasons, hypoxic death of cells within the central nervous system often manifests as liquefactive necrosis. Caseous necrosis is encountered most often in foci of tuberculous infection. The term \"caseous\" (cheeselike) is derived from the friable white appearance of the area of necrosis. On microscopic examination, the necrotic area appears as a structureless collection of fragmented or lysed cells and amorphous granular debris enclosed within a distinctive inflammatory border; this appearance is characteristic of a focus of inflammation known as a granuloma",
