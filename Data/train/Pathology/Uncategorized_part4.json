Telomerase is the RNA enzyme that helps in repair of such damage to DNA and maintains normal telomere length in successive cell divisions. However, it has been seen that after repetitive mitosis for a maximum of 60 to 70 times, telomeres are lost in normal cells and the cells cease to undergo mitosis. Telomerase is active in normal stem cells, but not in normal somatic cells. Cancer cells in most malignancies have markedly upregulated telomerase enzyme, and hence telomere length is maintained.

The role of both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways is to eventually produce prothrombin activator. Prothrombin activator is a complex of:- - Activated factor XQ - Activated factor V andQ --ca+-1-u. Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways involve a number of clotting factors which paicipate in cascading reactions, that ultimately lead to the formation of activated factor X which combines with factor V and Ca++ to. form prothrombin activator.. When a blood vessel ruptures, clotting occurs by both pathways simultaneously.. Tissue thronzboplastin released from the damazed cells in the vascular endothelium activates extrinsic pathway, while,. Contact of factor XII and platelets with collagen in the vascular wall initiates the intrinsic pathway Thrombin Time. It is the time taken for clotting to occur when thrombin is added to the plasmaQ (normal < 15 s).. It tests the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and depends on adequate fibrinogen levels('.. So, the conditions in which fibrinogen level is decreased will cause prolonged thrombin time. These conditions are a) AfibrinogenemiaQ b).

She underwent a hysterectomy 2 months ago and began estrogen replacement therapy recently. On admission, her temperature is 38. 7 C (102 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, Pulse is 98/min, and Respiratory rate is 20/min. She appears disoriented to time and place. Physical examination reveals jaundiced sclerae and skin, purpura on the trunk, and bleeding gums. Her platelet count is 25, 000/mm3, hematocrit is 24%, and creatinine is 4. 9 mg/dL. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and indirect bilirubin are elevated. Coagulation tests are within normal limits, but the bleeding time is increased; fibrin-split products and Coombs test are negative. A peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes, helmet-shaped cells, and cells with a triangular shape. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology. It is characterized by an increased bleeding time but a decreased platelet count. It causes purpura, fever, renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and microthrombi, frequently in young women. Elevated indirect bilirubin and high LDH are characteristic, as are schistocytes in the blood smear, renal dysfunction, and neurologic and systemic symptoms. Negative findings impoant to rule out similar conditions include a negative Coombs test and absence of fibrin split products. TTP is thought to be initiated by endothelial injury, which releases ceain procoagulant materials into the circulation, causing platelet aggregation. This condition may be precipitated by pregnancy or use of estrogens. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia can cause anemia and an elevated indirect bilirubin, but generally produces only mild symptoms, is not associated with thrombocytopenia, and does not cause fragmentation of red blood cells on the peripheral smear. The negative Coombs test argues against autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation can be differentiated from TTP because of abnormal coagulation tests. In DIC, microangiopathic hemolysis is also present, but the prothrombin time (PT) and paial thromboplastin time (PTT) are prolonged, fibrinogen levels are reduced, and fibrin split products are elevated. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome is not significantly different from TTP. The two conditions, in fact, are considered manifestations of the same pathogenetic spectrum. However, the vascular bed of the CNS is not involved in HUS. Thus, mental status changes are not pa of the clinical picture of HUS.",

Some rare tumours (e. g. choriocarcinoma) have a high likelihood of metastasizing to the brain, whereas some more common tumours (e. g. prostatic tumours) almost never grow in the brain, even when they are metastatic to adjacent bone and dura. Prostatic carcinoma Advanced prostate cancer can spread to other pas of the body, causing symptoms. The most common symptom is bone pain, often in the veebrae, pelvis, or ribs. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the femur is usually to the proximal pa of the bone. Prostate cancer in the spine can also compress the spinal cord, causing leg weakness and urinary and fecal incontinence Trophoblastic diseases They comprise a variety of biologically interrelated conditions which form a clinical spectrum consisting of four distinct clinical pathological entities like - Molar pregnancy Invasive mole - Placental site trophoblastic tumours and - Choriocarcinoma Incidence of hydatidiform mole ranges from 1 in 500 in India to 1 in 3000 in USA. Like wise malignant potential of the disease is also higher in Southeast Asia reaching as high as 10-15% compared to 2-4% in west. Some of the hydatidiform moles erode the wall of uterus, burrow into myometrium and may even burst though the uterus into peritoneum and are called invasive mole. Even though locally aggressive, invasive mole does not metastasise. On the other hand choriocarcinoma is rare but one of the most malignant neoplasms arising in the body of uterus. Choriocarcinoma metastasises readily. It is not uncommon to find secondary nodules in the cervix or vagina. The lungs, brain and liver are the distant organs more often involved. Lymph nodes are rarely the site of metastasis Brain metastases They are the most common type of brain tumors, with the total number diagnosed annually outnumbering all other intracranial tumors combined. The most common source of brain metastases in males is lung cancer and in females is breast cancer. The mechanisms by which primary tumors produce brain metastases is thought to be hematogenous spread from primary or secondary sites in the lung. Since the brain has no lymphatic system, all tumors metastasizing to the brain do so by spreading through the bloodstream. Aerial blood passes through the lungs before entering the brain, and collects tumor cells filtered out in capillaries, which subsequently embolize to the brain. Melanoma has the highest tendency to produce multiple lesions, followed by lung and breast cancers.",

This occurs in the calamitous abdominal emergency known as acute pancreatitis. In this disorder, pancreatic enzymes that have leaked out of acinar cells and ducts liquefy the membranes of fat cells in the peritoneum, and lipases split the triglyceride esters contained within fat cells. The released fatty acids combine with calcium to produce grossly visible chalky white areas (fat saponification), which enable the surgeon and the pathologist to identify the lesions. On histologic examination, the foci of necrosis contain shadowy outlines of necrotic fat cells surrounded by basophilic calcium deposits and an inflammatory reaction.

Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar.

Negri bodies are discrete, intracytoplasmic, deeply eosinophilic inclusions that measure several microns in diameter. In about 75% of cases of rabies these can be seen on hematoxylin and eosin stained sections. They occur in neurons of the brain stem, paicularly those in the hippocampus, and in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Ultrastructural studies have shown that Negri body consists of a mass of nucleocapsids surrounded by viral paicles budding from intracytoplasmic membranes. Those bodies can be seen in axons, and it is in this way that virus spreads from the central nervous system to many organs of the body. Because Negri bodies are usually seen in intact neurons, they are found away from the inflammatory, nonspecific lesions. Rabies viral antigens can be demonstrated in infected cells by means of fluorescent antibody technique. Antigens can be shown to be present in cells in the absence of Negri bodies, and hence this technique is much more sensitive than the search of sections of brain for the pathognomonic cytoplasmic inclusions.",

Ag is the earliest virological marker in serum of patients with acute hepatitis B, it does not help in establishing the diagnosis of acute Hepatitis B infection (it may be seen in chronic cases or carrier state). It is the presence of IgM anti-HBc that confirms an acute Hepatitis B infection. HBs. Ag. The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs. Ag) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection. However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. Anti-HBc Ig. MThe infectious virion contains an inner \"core paicle\" enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core paicle is made of 180 or 240 copies of core protein, alternatively known as hepatitis B core antigen, or HBc. Ag. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease. Hbe. Ag and anti-HBe. Sholy after the appearance of the HBs. Ag, the hepatitis B e antigen (HBe. Ag) will appear. Traditionally, the presence of HBe. Ag in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity. During the natural course of an infection, the HBe. Ag may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (anti-HBe) will arise immediately afterwards. This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc Ig. GIf the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBs. Ag will become undetectable and will be followed by IgG antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen, (anti-HBs and anti HBc IgG). The time between the removal of the HBs. Ag and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the window period. A person negative for HBs. Ag but positive for anti-HBs has either cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously. Hepatitis B carriers. Individuals who remain HBs. Ag positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers. Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and inflammation of the liver, as revealed by biopsy. Carriers who have seroconveed to HBe. Ag negative status, paicularly those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others. PCR tests. They have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens. These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment. Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy.",

Minimal change disease can be associated with food allergies, medications, or hematologic malignancies, or it can occur idiopathically. The pathology does not appear to involve complement, immunoglobulins, or immune complex deposition. Rather, an altered cell-mediated immunologic response with abnormal secretion of lymphokines by T cells is thought to reduce the production of anions in the glomerular basement membrane, thereby increasing the glomerular permeability to plasma albumin through a reduction of electrostatic repulsion. The loss of anionic charges is also thought to or foot process fusion. Some authors have noted that other conditions associated with T-cell abnormalities, such as Hodgkin's disease and T-cell lymphoma, are sometimes associated with minimal change disease. Consumption of complement factors is observed in many conditions in which complement activation occurs, for example, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. IgG directed against renal and pulmonary basement membranes is found in Goodpasture's syndrome, a cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and hemoptysis. Immune complex deposition is associated with type III hypersensitivity reactions, including postinfectious glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, cryoglobulinemia, and bacterial endocarditis.

Necrosis only represents the morphological changes that occur after cell death. o These morphological changes (necrosis) is the result of 2 concurrent processes:? 1. Enzymatic digestion of the cell q Enzymes used in the process are derived from two sources:? (a) From the lysosomes of the dead cells themselves (Autolysis) (b) From the lysosomes of the immigrant leukocytes (Heterolysis) 2. Denaturation of intracellular proteins o These processes require hours to develop, So immediatly after cell death there are no detectable necrotic changes. o Necrosis usually effects a group of contigous cells (in contrast to apoptosis that involves death of a single cells), but it can effect single cell also. o In necrosis, there is diruption of membrane integrity --3 Intracellular contents leak out and elicit inflammation --> Inflammatory changes in the surrounding tissue (By contrast, in apoptosis there is no inflammatory reaction in the tissue). Morphological changes o As necrosis follows irreversible injury, the morphological changes are same that have been described in irreversible injury. These are? 1. Membrane damage 2.

        "exp": "Ans. B: Post-prandial abdominal pain, weight loss, chronic mesenteric vessel occlusion The 3 aeries supplying the gut are the celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric. Unless significant stenoses or actual occlusion of 2 of the 3 vessels is present, efficient collateral circulation between the celiac and superior mesenteric aeries (i. e., the pancreaticoduodenal arcades) and the superior and inferior mesenteric aeries (i. e., the meandering mesenteric aery) ensures that blood flow to the gut generally is adequate. The internal iliac aeries also may be an impoant source of collateral hindgut and midgut perfusion in the presence of inferior mesenteric aerial occlusion. The most common cause of abdominal angina is atherosclerotic vascular disease (chronic process). The occlusive process commonly involves the ostia and a few proximal centimeters of the mesenteric vessels. Abdominal angina is defined as the postprandial pain that occurs in individuals with sufficient mesenteric vascular occlusive disease such that blood flow cannot increase enough to meet visceral demands. Soon, patients associate eating with pain and develop a characteristic fear of food (i. e., sitophobia) or food-avoidance behavior. Repoed weight loss averages 5-6 kg.",

The taurodontic teeth are identified by elongated pulp. chambers and apical displacement of bifurcation or trifurcation of the roots. Due to this, the chamber has a greater apicoocclusal height than in cynodont teeth and lacks the constriction at the level of the CEJ giving it a rectangular shape.",

For epithelial mesotheliomas, positive staining for pankeratin and calretinin and negative staining for three epithelial markers are considered sufficient for diagnosis.

Epithelial metaplasia Here one type of adult epithelium is replaced by another type of adult epithelium. It may be:? a) Squamous metaplasia It occurs most frequently in respiratory tract as a result of chronic irritation by cigarette smoking. The columnar epithelium is replaced by squamous epithelium. This squamous metaplasia represents an attempt by the host to repair or prepare an epithelial tissue that has been damaged by environmental toxicants with a more resistant tissue. Squamous metaplasia is also encountered in other location such as pancreatic duct (Vit A deficiency, stones in pancreatic duct), gall bladder (gall stones), urinary bladder (bladder calculi, Schistosomiasis), and in endocervix. Though the metaplasia is reversible, if influences that predispose to metaplasia is persistent, malignant transformation may occur in metaplastic epithelium. b) Glandular metaplasia Change of the squamous epithelium to glandular (columnar) epithelium. Development of Barrett's esophagus, i. e., Stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by gastric columnar epithelium. It is due to reflux of acid contents of stomach into esophagus. This necessitates the replacement of susceptible squamous epithelium of the lower third of esophagus with gastric acid resistant glandular epithelium. 2. Connective tissue metaplasia This transformation occurs between the mesodermally derived tissues i. e., one type of connective tissue is replaced by another type of connective tissue. This is characterized by conversion of fibroblast-derived soft tissue into muscle, Cailage or bone. Example-Bone formation in muscle i. e., myositis ossificans. Mechanism of metaplasia o Metaplasia is not due to change in differentiation between two terminally differentiated cells themselves. o Metaplasia results by disturbances in the cellular lineage in which precursor cells (Stem cells or undifferentiated mesenchymal cells) differentiate along a different pathway. o For example in tracheobranchial tree, the basal stem cells differentiate to yield ciliated columinar cells, but in chronic smokers, irritation causes a change in the normal differentiation process and stem cells differentiate through a different pathway to generate more resistant squamous epithelium.",

Effect of HbS on RBCs o In deoxygenated condition, the HbS molecules undergo polymerization and aggregation. o With continued deoxygenation, aggregated HbS molecules assemble into long needle-like fibers within red cells, producing a distoed sickle or holly-leaf shape. Sickling of red cells is reversible initialy, i. e., with oxygenation, HbS depolymerizes and cell shape normalizes. o However, with repeated episodes of deoxygenation and sickling, membrane damage occurs and cells become irreversibly sickled, and retain their abnormal shape even when full oxygenated. o With membrane damage water comes out of the cell resulting in intracellular dehydration ---> T MCHC. Due to membrane damage, sickle red cells become abnormally sticky --> responsible for microvascular occlusions.

Chediakhigashi syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transpo of materials into lysosomes. Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins. During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias. Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome. Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation. As a result, most people with chediakhigashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, staing in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening. Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected. The other cells involved are - Melanosomes of melanocytes Dense bodies of platelets Granules of schwann cells. There are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells. In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism-Le the colour of skin, hair and eye is reduced. Abnormality in platelets produce bleeding disorders. Defective granules in schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e. g. peripheral neuropathy. Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase, (lymphoma like stage). This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E. B. virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelarated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life threatening and lead to death.",

The histopathological hallmark of Wegener's granulomatosis is necrotizing vasculitis of small aeries and veins together with granuloma formation which may be either intravascular or extravascular. An impoant point to note, Though it is called granulomatous vasculitis:? - Granulomas in Wegener's' granulomatosis are seen only in lungs or respiratory tract. Granuloma formation is rarely seen in other organs. Other organs, only demonstrate necrotizing vasculitis. So Wegener's granulomatosis can also be defined as Granulomatous vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tracts together with glomerulonephritis. Bobbin's defines Wegener's granulomatosis as \"necrotizing vasculitis\" (not granulomatous vasculitis). According to Robbin's Wegener's granulomatosis is a necrotizing vasculitis characterized by a triad of:? - Acute necrotizing granuloma of upper respiratory tract (ear, nose, sinuses, throat) or the lower respiratory tract. - Necrotizing or granulomatous vasculitis affecting small to medium sized vessels (e. g. capillaries, venules, aeriole and aeria) most prominent in the lungs and upper airways but affecting other sites as well. - Renal disease in the. form of focal necrotizing often crescenteric glomerulonephritis.

The most recently discovered among this class of genes are that encode for gene-silencing RNAs, i. e. RNAs that do not encode proteins but instead inhibit gene expression (unlike classical RNAs which encode for proteins) Two gene-silencing RNAs are: Micro RNAs (mi. RNAs) Small interfering RNAs (si. RNAs) 1. Micro RNA (mi. RNAs) Because of their profound influence on gene regulation, mi. RNAs are assuming central impoance in understanding normal developmental pathways, as well as pathologic conditions, such as cancer. o By current estimates there are approximately 1000 genes in humons that encodes mi. RNAs. Transcription of mi. RNA gene produces primary mi. RNA transcripts, which is processed within the nucleus to form another structure, called pre-mi. RNA. Pre-mi. RNA is transpoed to cytoplasm by a transpoor (Expo) protein. Dicer (an enzyme) does the additional cutting of this pre-mi. RNA that are about 21-30 nucleotide in length (hence called \"micro\"). At this stage m. RNA is still double stranded. Next, the mi. RNA unwinds, and single strands of this duplex are incorporated into a multiprotein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Base-pairing between the mi. RNA strand and it target m. RNA (messenger RNA) directs RISC to either cause m. RNA cleavage or repress its translation. In this way, the gene from which the target was derived is silenced (at a post-transcription level). A single mi. RNA can silence many target genes. 2. Small interfering RNAs (si. RNAs) si. RNAs work in similar manner as mi. RNA Unlike mi. RNA, si. RNA precursors are introduced by investigators into cells. si. RNA are becoming powerful tools for studying gene function and may in the future be used therapeutically to silence specific genes, such as oncogenes, whose products are involved in neoplastic transformation.",

        "exp": "Reperfusion injury refers to myocardial vascular or electrophysiological dysfunction that is induced by the restoration of blood flow to previously ischemic tissue. o Manifestation includes: Reperfusion arrhythmias. Endothelial cell damage leading to microvascular dysfunction, Myocardial stunning. Myocyte death and infarction. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY- When blood flow to cardiac myocytes is disrupted by occlusion of a coronary artery, a series of events is set in motion that results in cellular injury and death. These processes are largely related to energy production and utilization and include the following: Reduced energy production with a fall in intracellular ATP levels, A transition from aerobic to anaerobic energy utilization, An accumulation of the products of anaerobic metabolism, Reduced intracellular pH. Factors that contribute to reperfusion injury include the following: Damage to cellular and organelle membranes, including mitochondria, Myocyte hypercontracture. Free radical formation. Aggregation of leukocytes and inflammatory mediators, Platelet activation. Complement activation. Activation of the pro-apoptotic signalling cascade. Endothelium damage and vasoconstriction. Oxygen and other free radicals - Free radicals are produced within a minute of reperfusion and continue to be generated for hours after the restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissue. Superoxide anion (O2) Hydrogen peroxide (H2. O2) Hypochlorous acid (HClO) Nitric oxide-derived peroxynitrite. Hydroxyl radical (OH) Several mechanisms have been proposed for the development of these free radicals including xanthine oxidase, activated neutrophils, electron leakage from ischemic mitochondrion, catecholamine oxidation, as well as cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes. The relative importance of each of these pathways is not clear, but they are probably interrelated and may potentiate one another. Free radicals damage myocytes directly by altering membrane proteins and phospholipids. Because these membrane constituents play crucial roles as receptors, enzymes, and ion channels, free radical injury can lead to fatal metabolic and structure derangements. As an example, oxygen radicals inure the sarcolemma and may impair the contractile function of the myocyte on this basis. The role for free radicals as a source of significant myocardial damage is further supported by studies showing that free radical scavengers, such as superoxide dismutase, administered during thrombolytic therapy help preserve myocardial function. Finally, reactive oxygen species stimulate leukocyte activation, chemotaxis, and leukocyte-endothelial adherence.",

Thromboangiitis obliterans occurs almost exclusively among heavy-cigarette-smoking persons. It is more common in men but the incidence is increasing in women because of increasing smoking habit in women. Buerger disease is associated with HLA -5 and HLA-A9. In thromboangiitis obliterans there is acute and chronic segmental inflammation of vessels with accompanied thrombosis in the lumen. Typically, the thrombus contains microabscesses with a central focus of neutrophils surrounded by granulomatous inflammation. Later, the inflammatory process extends into contiguous veins and nerves and in time all three structures (arteries, veins and nerves) become encased in fibrous tissue, a characteristic that is very rare with another form of vasculitis. Clinical manifestations Thrombangiitis obliterans affects vessels of upper and lower extremities. Symptoms are due to vascular insufficiency, i. e. Ischemia of toes, feet and fingers that can lead to ulcer and frank gangrene. Due to neural involvement, there may be severe pain, even at rest. Buerger disease Vs atherosclerosis Buerger disease is almost exclusively associated with smoking. Atherosclerosis is also associated with smoking, but it has other predisposing conditions also, e. g. diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia etc. Burger disease affects smaller arteries.

Hemoglobin concentration o The rate of HbS polymerization is strongly dependent upon the hemologbin concentration per cell i. e., MCHC. o Higher HbS concentration increase the probability that aggregation and polymerization will occur during any given period of time. o Thus, intracellular dehydration, which increases the MCHC, faciliatates sickling. o Conversly, conditions that decrease MCHC reduce disease severity e. g., when sickle cell anemia occurs with athalassemia 3. Deoxygenation with HbS o Polymerization of HbS occurs only in deoxygenated state. o A decrease in pH reduces the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, thereby increasing the fraction of deoxygenated HbS at any given oxygen tension and augmenting the tendency of sickling. 4. The length of time red cell are exposed to low oxygen tension. o Normal transient times for red cells passing through capillaries are not sufficient for significant aggregation of deoxygenated HbS to occurs. o Hence, sickling of red cells is confined to microvascular beds where blood flow is sluggish. o This is normally the case in spleen and bone marrow which are predominantly affected by sickle cell disease.",

Alteration in the structure of chromosomes. 1. Abnormal number of chromosomes o There are 23 pairs of chromosomes (46, XX in females and 46, XY in males). o An exact multiple of the 23 (haploid number) is called euploidy. o When the number of chromosomes are not an exact multiple of 23, it is referred as aneuploidy. eg - Trisomy or monosomy. Pathogenesis of aneuploidy o In aneuploidy error either in meiosis or in mitosis. (a) Error in meiosis o It is the most common cause of aneuploidy. o The usual causes are nondisjunction or anaphase lag. o In nondisjunction, chromosomal pair fails to separate in first meiotic division during gametogenesis, so one gamete has an extra chromosome (n+1) and the other has one less chromosome (n-1). Feilization of such gametes with normal gamete results in two types of zygotes - trisomy (2n+1) or monosomy (2n-1). o In anaphase lag, one chromosome lags behind and is left out of the cell nucleus. The result is one gamete with normal chromosomes (n) and other gamete with one less chromosome (n-1). Feilization in two types of zygote -4 normal (2n) or monosomy (2n-1). (b) Error in Mitosis o Error in mitosis in early development give rise to two or more different types of populations in the same individuals, a condition referred as mosaicism. o Mosaicism affecting the sex chromosome is common. o In the division of an feilized ovum, an error may lead to one of the daughter cell receiving three sex chromosomes, where as the other recieves only one, yielding, a 45, X/47, XXX mosaic. That means the same individual will have both types of cells cells having 45, X and cells having 47, XXX. Then what is the difference between Monosomy / trisomy and mosachism? Trisomy/monosomy are due to defect in meiosis and before feilization, so that after feilization all cells have same number of chromosome either monosomy or trisomy. In mosaicism, defect is in mitosis and after feilization so that same individual has cells of two different population eg. 45, X and 47, XXX. 2. Abnormal structure of chromosome o Chromosomal structural changes usually result from chromosome breakage followed by loss or rearrangement. o Beside these chromosomal structural abnormalities some autosomal recessive genetic disorders are associated with such a high level of chromosomal instability that they are known as chromosomal breakage syndrome --> Ataxia - telangiectasis, bloom syndrome, and fanconi anemia. There is significantly increased risk of cancer in these syndromes.",

Serum ferritin o Most of the ferritin is stored is different organs (liver, spleen, bone marrow). o Very small amounts of ferritin normally circulate in the plasma. Since plasma ferritin is derived largely form the storage pool of body iron, its level correlate well with body iron stores. i. e., when there is iron depletion, body store of iron is reduced that inturn leads to decrease in plasma ferritin. Transferrin saturation and iron binding capicity 3 Iron is transpoed in the plasma by transferrin. o Normally transferrin is 33% saturated (77% free) with iron, yield serum iron levels that average 100-120 g/dl. So, if serum transferrin will be 100% saturated the serum iron will be 300 g/dl. that means the total iron binding capacity of transferrin is 300 to 350 g/dl. o When iron store is depleted e. g., in iron dificiency anemia, there is increased synthesis of transferrin that results in increased total iron binding capacity. o When iron store is repleted e. g., anemia of chronic disease, there is decreased synthesis of transferrin that results in decreased total iron binding capacity. Serum transferrin receptors Erythroid precursors have receptors for transferrin by which they recieve iron from transferrin that is utilized for hemoglobin synthesis. o When erythroid precursors mature, these receptors are shed into plasma and can be masured as serum transferrin receptors concentration. o In iron deficiency state, there is increased erythropoisis in bone marrow --> T concentration of erythroid precursor that results in increased total number of transferrin receptor T serum transferrin receptor concentration.",

Their shape is determined by the external environment of the cell, the metabolic activity of the cell, the nature of hemoglobin, the membrane skeleton, and age of the cell. The red blood cell's durability and flexibility are due to its submembranous protein network, the membrane skeleton. The membrane skeleton consists predominantly of four proteins: spectrin, actin, protein 4. 1, and ankyrin (also known as syndein). Spectrin is an extrinsic protein located on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. It is long and unusually flexible molecule consisting of two structurally and functionally distinct polypeptide chains. The membrane of the RBC comprises a phospholipid bilayer and an underlying two-dimensional network of spectrin molecules. The composite propeies of the phospholipid bilayer and spectrin network result in the biconcave or discocyte morphology of healthy RBCs and give the membrane its elastic and biorheological propeies.

It is defined pathologically as an abnormal permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by the destruction of alveolar walls and without obvious fibrosis. It frequently occurs in association with chronic bronchitis. Patients have been classified as having COPD with either emphysema or chronic bronchitis predominance. The 3 described morphological types of emphysema are centriacinar, panacinar, and paraseptal. Centriacinar emphysema begins in the respiratory bronchioles and spreads peripherally. Also termed centrilobular emphysema, this form is associated with long-standing cigarette smoking and predominantly involves the upper half of the lungs. - Panacinar emphysema destroys the entire alveolus uniformly and is predominant in the lower half of the lungs. Panacinar emphysema generally is observed in patients with homozygous alfal antitrypsin deficiency. In people who smoke, focal panacinar emphysema at the lung bases may accompany centriacinar emphysema. - Paraseptal emphysema, also known as distal acinar emphysema, preferentially involves the distal airway structures, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs. The process is localized around the septae of the lungs or pleura. Although airflow frequently is preserved, the apical bullae may lead to spontaneous pneumothorax. Giant bullae occasionally cause severe compression of adjacent lung tissue.",

Systemic symptoms in localized secondary TB, often appear early in the course and include malaise, anorexia, weight loss, and fever. Commonly the fever is low grade and remittent (appearing late each afternoon and then subsiding), and night sweats occur. Regional lymph nodes are less prominently involved early in secondary disease than they are in primary disease. Histologically, sites of active involvement are marked by a characteristic granulomatous inflammatory reaction that forms both caseating and non-caseating tubercles.",

Glycogen is viually absent from the hepatocytes in biopsy specimen. Mitochondrias are large pleomorphic and have decreased matricial density on electron microscopy. The kidney changes include swelling and fatty degeneration of proximal tubules. Astrocyte edema and loss of neuron in the brain. Reyes syndrome It is an acute self limiting metabolic insult of diverse etiology resulting in generalised nzitochondrial dysfunction due to inhibition of fatty acid )8 oxidation. Salicylates or viral infection can precipitate this metabolic impairment. The pathogenesis is thought to be damage to mitochondria caused by salicylate metabolite or some other toxin or chemical in the setting of viral infection. The reasons for mitochondria' dysfunction are unknown. No toxic factor has yet been conclusively identified but studies have suggested an etiological link among Reye's syndrome. The activities of hepatic mitachondrial enzymes including ornithine transcarbamylase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and pyruvate dehydrogenase are reduced often to less than half their normal values. Mitochondria' dysfunction leads to elevated sho chain fatty acids and hyperanzmonenzia as well as directly to cerebral edema. It is prudent to avoid the use of aspirin as an antipyretic in pediatric patients with influenza or varicella. Clinical manifestations:- Classic Reyes syndrome exihibits a stereotypic biphasic course. It usually occurs in a previously healthy child. A prodromal febrile illness, an upper respiratory tract infection or chicken pox is followed by an interval in which the child has seemingly recovered. The abrupt onsent of protracted vomiting then occurs usually within 5-7 days after the onset of viral illness. Delirium, combative behaviour and stupor may occur simultaneously within a few hours after the onset of vomiting. Neurological symptoms may rapidly progress to seizures, coma and death; focal neurological signs are absent. Laboratory features:- There is explosive release from liver and muscle of enzymes such as aminotransferases, creatine kinase and lactic dehydrogenase. The activity of the mitochondrial enzyme serum glutamate dehydrogenase is greatly increased. Serum Ammonia level is increased. The prothrombin time is mild to moderately increased.",

        "exp": "Long-standing inflammatory conditions such as RA are associated with deposition of a form of amyloid known as AA (amyloid-associated protein), which may involve kidneys, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and skin, for example. Amyloid deposition in the myocardium results in decreased compliance and impaired diastolic filling, i. e., restrictive cardiomyopathy. The myocardium has a rigid and waxy texture. This form of amyloid, as well as any other biochemical form, can be visualized on tissue section by staining with Congo red, which acquires a characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Note: Constrictive pericarditis is due to any pathologic process that results in fibrous thickening of the pericardium, with resultant impaired compliance. Clinically, therefore, this condition manifests with a picture similar to restrictive cardiomyopathy because of impaired diastolic filling. Constrictive pericarditis is usually caused by previous episodes of acute pericarditis, especially hemorrhagic, suppurative, and caseous pericarditis. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by massive ventricular dilatation and may be caused by genetic alterations, myocarditis, toxic insults (alcohol), metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis), etc. Most cases are idiopathic. The main pathophysiologic alteration is impaired contractility. Most cases of hyperophic cardiomyopathy are familial and due to mutations in one of the genes encoding proteins of the sarcomeres, most frequently b-myosin heavy chain. This form of cardiomyopathy leads to asymmetric hyperophy of the left ventricle, with prominent thickening of the interventricular septum. In this case, too, impairment of ventricular compliance is the basic mechanism leading to reduced diastolic filling and heart failure. Ref: Stevenson L. W., Loscalzo J. (2012). Chapter 238.

        "question": "Classic example of missense mutation?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Sickle cell disease In sickle cell anemia there is missense type of point mutation. Mutations A mutation is apermanant change in the DNA. Mutations that affect genii cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease. Mutations that affect somatic cells arc not transmitted to progeny but are impoant in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations. Mutations may be classified into three categories? 1. Gene mutations The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations. These may of different types depending whether it involves complete gene or single base? (a) Point mutation A single nucleotide base is subustituted by a different base. When a pyrimidine base is subustituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine Transition. When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa Transversion. This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i. e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product. Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation. Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in 13-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine. Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon. 3 Example is 13-thalassemia in which CAG codon in I3-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation. (b) Deletion and inseions Deletion or inseion of one or two base lead to alterations in the reading frame of the DNA strand --> frame shift mutation. If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three framshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized. (c) Trinucleotide repeat mutation Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide. In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain. For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG. 2. Chromosome mutation Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome. 3. Genome mutation Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e. g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",

One or two percent of these malignant cells are admixed within a reactive cell infiltrate composed of variable proportions of lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells. The Reed-Sternberg cells are identified as large often binucleated cells with prominent nucleoli and an unusual CD15+, CD30+ immunophenotype. In approximately 50% of cases, the Reed-Sternberg cells are infected by the Epstein-Barr virus. Ref: Shafer's Ed 7th Pg 187",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Depends on platelet activation Thrombosis Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) inside a blood vessel or heart, obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system. Then what is the difference between formation of normal hemostatic plug and thrombosis? When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses platelet and fibrin to form a blood clot as the first step to prevent blood loss - hemostasis. If that mechanism causes too much doting, a thrombus is formed i. e., exaggeration of hemostatic process leads to thrombus formation. In other terms, hemostasis is a self limited process i. e., there is spontaneous resolution of hemostatic plug with subsequent repair of the injury, while thrombosis is not self limited and the thrombotic clot does not undergo resolution spontaneously rather it causes obstruction to blood flow. Thrombosis may occur without injury (e. g., in hypercoagulable state), while hemostatic plug is formed only after injury. Pathogenesis of thrombosis Thrombosis is caused by abnormalities in one or more of the following three (Virchow's triad):? Vascular (endothelial) injury. Abnormal blood flow (stasis or turbulence). Blood hypercoagulability. How do these mechanisms lead to thrombosis? Endothelial injury with formation of clot has already been explained earlier. Blood hypercoagulability, as the name suggests, there is increase tendency of clot formation due to alteration in coagulation pathway that predisposes to thrombus. It may occur in many primary (genetic) or secondary (acquired) conditions. Disturbances in blood flow Stasis- Stasis is the major factor in the development of venous thrombus. Turbulence contributes to aerial and cardiac thrombosis. Normal blood flow is laminar such that the platelets flow centrally in the vessel lumen, separated from the endothelium by a slower-moving clear zone of plasma. Stasis and turbulence leads to thrombosis by? Disruption of laminar flow brings platelets into contact with endothelium. Prevent dilution of activated clotting factors by fresh flowing blood. Retard the inflow of clotting factor inhibitors. Turbulence can cause endothelial injury or dysfunction.",

Hypersegmented neutrophil. Normally, the number of segments in the nucleus of a neutrophil increases as it matures and ages, after being released into the blood from the bone marrow. Whereas normal neutrophils only contain three or four nuclear lobes (the \"segments\"), hypersegmented neutrophils contain five or more lobes. Hypersegmented neutrophils have classically been thought to be pathognomonic of the megaloblastic anemias (anemias caused by failure of bone marrow blood-forming cells to make DNA, often caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies, or DNA-replication poisons). One of the earliest, notable changes in the peripheral blood in megaloblastic processes is the appearance of hypersegmented neutrophils. Because of the sho life-span of neutrophils, these abnormal hypersegmented neutrophils characteristically appear even before the onset of anemia in megaloblastic processes. Such neutrophils are less often seen in the other classes of anemia, which together are far more common than megaloblastic types of anemia.

They have a high osmotic fragility and are more prone to physical degradation. They are most commonly found in immunologically-mediated hemolytic anemias and in hereditary spherocytosis, but the former would have a positive direct Coombs test and the latter would not. The misshapen but otherwise healthy red blood cells are mistaken by the spleen for old or damaged red blood cells and it thus constantly breaks them down, causing a cycle whereby the body destroys its own blood supply (auto-hemolysis). Chronic symptoms include anemia and splenomegaly. As a result of the broken-down blood cells -- bilirubin -- accumulates in the gallbladder and can cause pigmented gallstones to develop. In peripheral blood smears, red blood cells will appear abnormally small. The CBC will show elevated MCHC. The bone marrow in its role of manufacturing red blood cells will display hyperplasia, the increased activity of replacing RBCs.

Multifactorial causes are probably the most clinically relevant hypocalcemic emergencies include the following: - Acute pancreatitis: Free fatty acids chelate calcium, causing saponification in the retroperitoneum. - Rhabdomyolysis: Increased phosphates from creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and other anions (i. e., lactate, bicarbonate) chelate calcium. - Sepsis can cause hypocalcemia through many mechanisms. - Toxic shock syndrome can cause hypocalcemia. High calcitonin levels cause low calcium. - Malignancy: Osteoblastic metastases (e. g., breast cancer, prostate cancer) and tumor lysis syndrome may cause hypocalcemia (by differing mechanisms). - Hepatic or renal insufficiency: Calciuresis, hypomagnesemia, hypoalbuminemia, and low active vitamin D levels may contribute to poor calcium homeostasis. - Infiltrative disease: Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and hemochromatosis may infiltrate the parathyroids, causing dysfunction. -- Toxicologic causes include hydrofluoric acid burn or ingestion. Enhanced protein binding and anion chelation - Protein binding is enhanced by elevated pH and free fatty acid release in high catecholamine states. Anion chelation is seen in high phosphate states (e. g., renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, mesenteric ischemia, oral administration of phosphate-containing enemas); high citrate states (e. g., massive blood transfusion, radiocontrast dyes); and high bicarbonate, lactate, and oxalate levels. Medication effects - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid production resulting in reduced calcium absorption. - Selective serotonin inhibitors can have a calcium antagonistic effect on smooth muscle, paicularly vascular endothelium. - Calcitonin and bisphosphonates cause chelation and end-organ inhibition. - Phenobarbital and phenytoin enhance vitamin D catabolism and decrease calcium resorption in the gut. Foscarnet complexes with calcium. Fluoride, paicularly hydrofluoric acid, chelates calcium avidly and causes profound hypocalcemia. Ethylene glycol complexes with calcium. Estrogen inhibits bone resorption. Cimetidine decreases gastric pH, slowing fat breakdown, which is necessary to complex calcium for gut absorption. Aluminum and alcohol suppress PTH. Gadolinium-based contrast material can falsely lower serum calcium levels and should be considered if levels are drawn sholy after magnetic resonance imaging. Postsurgical effects Parathyroid adenoma resection causes a transient hypocalcemia due to end-organ PTH resistance in the first postoperative day. Pancreatectomy prevents calcium absorption in the duodenum and the jejunum by eliminating necessary enzymes. Small bowel syndrome causes hypocalcemia by reducing the surface available to absorb fatty acids and calcium. PTH deficiency/resistance Infiltrative diseases include Wilson disease and metastatic cancer. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is due to PTH resistance and has many forms, most notably Albright disease. Renal failure can result in a variety of endocrine disorders, occasionally including hypocalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency/resistance - Rickets may be due to lack of vitamin D or end-organ receptor resistance. - Hepatorenal disease: The liver and the kidney provide intermediary enzymes to form active 1, 25 (OH)2 D.",

According to this hypothesis, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response of the arterial wall initiated by injury to endothelium. Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis Following stages occurs in the pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis 1. Endothelial injury Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade. Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornerstone in the development of atherosclerosis. After the injury, the endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 and there is increased permeability to endothelium. TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression. 2. Migration of leukocytes When VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium. Leukocytes then cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space. Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells -> formation of the earliest lesion, i. e. fatty streak. Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modified LDL). 3. Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-\u03b1 and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation. 4. Maturation of plague Smooth muscle cells synthesize extracellular matrix (especially collagen) and convert a fatty streak into a mature fibro-fatty atheroma, and contribute to the progressive growth of atherosclerotic lesions.",

        "exp": "Ans. is `b' i. e., Angleman syndrome o Don't get confused by previous explanations, where I have explained the deletion of paternal chromosome 15 in Prader Willi Syndrome. o To understand this question, one should know genomic imprinting as well as uniparental disomy. Genomic imprinting o A person inherits two copies of their genes one_ form their mother and one from their father Usually both copies of each gene are active or \"turned on\" in cells.. o In some cases however only one of the two copies is turned on. o Which copy is active depends on the parent of origin. Some genes are normally active only when they are inherited from a person's father. Others are active only when inherited from a person's mother. o This phenomenon is known as genomic imprinting. In genes that undergo genomic imprinting, the parent of origin is often marked or \"stamped\" on the gene during the formation of egg and sperm cells. This stamping process called methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to ceain segments of DNA. These molecules identify which copy of a gene was inherited from the mother and which was inherited from father. The gene that are imprinted or stamped are \"silent\"i. e., they do not remain functional. Uniparental disomy (UDP) o Normally a person inherits one copy of each chromosome pair from biological mother and the other copy of the chromosome pair from biological father. Uniparental disomy occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome from the same parent and no copies from the other parent. o UDP can occur as random event during the formation of egg or sperm cells or may happen in early fetal development. Example of Genomic imprinting and UDP The classical examples are Prader -Willi syndrome and Angleman syndrome. Prader-Willi syndrome o Approximately 70% of affected individuals have a small deletion on long arm ofparenteral chromosome 15, i. e. paternal genomic imprinting. There is silencing of paternal gene due to deletion.. Paternal gene Silenced (Paternal genomic imprinting) Maternal gene Only functional alle present o The remaining 30% of patients have maternal uniparenteral disomy for chromosome 15. That is they have two otherwise normal copies of maternal chromosome 15 and no paternal 15. o Thus Prader Willi syndrome ( in both above situations) results from the absence of paternal contribution to this region of chrmosome 15, whether by paternal deletion ( paternal genomic imprinting) or maternal UPD. Angleman syndrome o Most of the affected individuals have deletion on maternal chrmosome 15, i. e. maternal genomic imprinting. There is silencing of maternal gene due to deletion. Maternal gene Silenced (Maternal genomic imprinting) Paternal gene Only functional allel present o The remaining patients have paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 15, i. e., they have two otherwise normal copies of paternal chromosome 15 and no maternal 15. o Thus Angleman syndrome results from the absence of maternal contribution to this region of chromossome 15, whether by maternal deletion ( maternal genomicimprinting) or paternal UDP.

In atherosclerosis, there is hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis due to associated inflammation (remind you-atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition). So there is consistent deposition of fibrin. Lp (a) has close homology to plasminogen and it competes with plasminogen for binding on the surface of endothelium. This result in the reduced generation of plasmin from plasminogen -> Inhibition of endogenous fibrinolytic system. This enhances further fibrin deposition. In addition, Lp (a) is accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions. So, Lp (a) causes impaired cell surface fibrinolysis and progressive atherosclerosis.",

The two major functions of p53 in the normal cell cycle are as under: In blocking mitotic activity: p53 inhibits the cyclins and CDKs and prevents the cell to enter G1 phase transiently. This breathing time in the cell cycle is utilised by the cell to repair the DNA damage. In promoting apoptosis: Normally, p53 acts together with another anti-oncogene, RB gene, and identifies the genes that have damaged DNA which cannot be repaired by inbuilt system. p53 directs such cells to apoptosis by activating apoptosis-inducing BAX gene, and thus bringing the defective cells to an end by apoptosis. This process operates in the cell cycle at G1 and G2 phases before the cell enters the S or M phase. Because of these significant roles in cell cycle, p53 is called as 'protector of the genome'.

Adenomatous polyp (Adenoma) o Adenoma contains proliferative dysplastic epithelium and thereby has malignant potential. o Most common site is the antrum. 3. Other rare type of polyps are --> Fundic gland polyps, Peutz - Jegher polyps, Juvenile polyp, and Inflammatory fibroid polyp (eosinophlic granuloma). Following information have been added in Pie of Robbins o Hyperplastic polyps are also referred to as inflammatory polyps as they develop in association with chronic gastritis, which initiates the injury and reactive hyperplasia that leads to polyp growth. o Hypeplastic polyp occurs between 50-60 years of age. o Among individuals with H. Pylori gastrititis, polyp may regress after bacterial eradication. o Because the risk of dysplasia correlates with size, polyps larger than 1. 5 cm should be resected and examined histologically. o The prevelance offundic gland polyps has increased markedly in recent years as a result of proton pump inhibitor therapy.
