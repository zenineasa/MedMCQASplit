Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways involve a number of clotting factors which paicipate in cascading reactions, that ultimately lead to the formation of activated factor X which combines with factor V and Ca++ to .form prothrombin activator. .

On admission, her temperature is 38.7 C (102 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, Pulse is 98/min, and Respiratory rate is 20/min. She appears disoriented to time and place. Physical examination reveals jaundiced sclerae and skin, purpura on the trunk, and bleeding gums. Her platelet count is 25,000/mm3, hematocrit is 24%, and creatinine is 4.9 mg/dL. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and indirect bilirubin are elevated. Coagulation tests are within normal limits, but the bleeding time is increased; fibrin-split products and Coombs test are negative. A peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes, helmet-shaped cells, and cells with a triangular shape. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology. It is characterized by an increased bleeding time but a decreased platelet count. It causes purpura, fever, renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and microthrombi, frequently in young women. Elevated indirect bilirubin and high LDH are characteristic, as are schistocytes in the blood smear, renal dysfunction, and neurologic and systemic symptoms. Negative findings impoant to rule out similar conditions include a negative Coombs test and absence of fibrin split products. TTP is thought to be initiated by endothelial injury, which releases ceain procoagulant materials into the circulation, causing platelet aggregation. This condition may be precipitated by pregnancy or use of estrogens. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia can cause anemia and an elevated indirect bilirubin, but generally produces only mild symptoms, is not associated with thrombocytopenia, and does not cause fragmentation of red blood cells on the peripheral smear. The negative Coombs test argues against autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation can be differentiated from TTP because of abnormal coagulation tests. In DIC, microangiopathic hemolysis is also present, but the prothrombin time (PT) and paial thromboplastin time (PTT) are prolonged, fibrinogen levels are reduced, and fibrin split products are elevated. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome is not significantly different from TTP. The two conditions, in fact, are considered manifestations of the same pathogenetic spectrum.

        "exp": "Ans. D: Prostatic carcinoma The 5 most common primary sites are lung, breast, skin (melanoma), kidney and gastrointestinal tract, accounting for about 80% of all metastases. Some rare tumours (e.g. choriocarcinoma) have a high likelihood of metastasizing to the brain, whereas some more common tumours (e.g. prostatic tumours) almost never grow in the brain, even when they are metastatic to adjacent bone and dura. Prostatic carcinoma Advanced prostate cancer can spread to other pas of the body, causing symptoms. The most common symptom is bone pain, often in the veebrae, pelvis, or ribs. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the femur is usually to the proximal pa of the bone. Prostate cancer in the spine can also compress the spinal cord, causing leg weakness and urinary and fecal incontinence Trophoblastic diseases They comprise a variety of biologically interrelated conditions which form a clinical spectrum consisting of four distinct clinical pathological entities like - Molar pregnancy Invasive mole - Placental site trophoblastic tumours and - Choriocarcinoma Incidence of hydatidiform mole ranges from 1 in 500 in India to 1 in 3000 in USA. Like wise malignant potential of the disease is also higher in Southeast Asia reaching as high as 10-15% compared to 2-4% in west. Some of the hydatidiform moles erode the wall of uterus, burrow into myometrium and may even burst though the uterus into peritoneum and are called invasive mole. Even though locally aggressive, invasive mole does not metastasise. On the other hand choriocarcinoma is rare but one of the most malignant neoplasms arising in the body of uterus. Choriocarcinoma metastasises readily. It is not uncommon to find secondary nodules in the cervix or vagina. The lungs, brain and liver are the distant organs more often involved. Lymph nodes are rarely the site of metastasis Brain metastases They are the most common type of brain tumors, with the total number diagnosed annually outnumbering all other intracranial tumors combined. The most common source of brain metastases in males is lung cancer and in females is breast cancer. The mechanisms by which primary tumors produce brain metastases is thought to be hematogenous spread from primary or secondary sites in the lung. Since the brain has no lymphatic system, all tumors metastasizing to the brain do so by spreading through the bloodstream. Aerial blood passes through the lungs before entering the brain, and collects tumor cells filtered out in capillaries, which subsequently embolize to the brain. Melanoma has the highest tendency to produce multiple lesions, followed by lung and breast cancers.",

That leads to formation of microthrombi throughout the microcirculation of the body, often in a quixotically even distribution. o As a consequence of the thrombotic diathesis, there is consumption of platelets, fibrin and coagulation factors_and secondary activation of fibrinolytic mechanism. o Thus DIC can present with signs and symptoms relating to tissue hypoxia and infarction caused by the myriad microthrombi or as a hemorrhagic disorder related to depletion of elements required for homeostasis, hence the term consumption coagulopathy is used to describe D.I.C. o DIC can also lead to hemolytic anemia. It occurs due to fragmentation of red cells as they try to squeeze through the narrowed microvasculature. Schistocytes, the cells characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are quiet common in patients with D. I.0 (seen in 50%) of cause. o Like D.I.C., TT.P too, is characterized by widespread thrombosis and similar to D.I.C, the disseminated thrombosis leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. But the point to emphasize is that in TT.P the thrombus is a platelet thrombi i.e. the thrombi is composed mainly of platelets aggregates so quite unlike D.I.C. the level of coagulation factors remain normal. Robbins' States \"While D.I.C. and thrombotic microangiopathies share features such as microvascular occlusion and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, they are pathogenetically distinct. In T. and HUS (unlike DIC), activation of the coagulation cascade is not of primary impoant, and hence results of laboratory tests of coagulation such as PT and PTT are usually normal.\"",

This is in marked contrast to ulcerative colitis, which most commonly shows continuous mucosal involvement. Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease can show mucosal atrophy. Chronic mucosal inflammation produces glandular atrophy, and a loss of mucosal folding. Mucosal ulceration is seen in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The ulcers of Crohn's disease are generally described as linear fissures, following the longitudinal axis of the intestine. Ulcerative colitis typically produces broad, extensive areas of ulceration.

The released fatty acids combine with calcium to produce grossly visible chalky white areas (fat saponification), which enable the surgeon and the pathologist to identify the lesions. On histologic examination, the foci of necrosis contain shadowy outlines of necrotic fat cells surrounded by basophilic calcium deposits and an inflammatory reaction.\nReference: Robbins Basic Pathology, Kumar, Abbas, Aster, Elsevier, 10th Edition, Page No: 37",

Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar.

B: RabiesSince first described by Negri in 1903, the presence of the Negri bodies are practically pathognomic for rabies and are an impoant diagnostic finding.Negri bodies are discrete, intracytoplasmic, deeply eosinophilic inclusions that measure several microns in diameter. In about 75% of cases of rabies these can be seen on hematoxylin and eosin stained sections.They occur in neurons of the brain stem, paicularly those in the hippocampus, and in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Ultrastructural studies have shown that Negri body consists of a mass of nucleocapsids surrounded by viral paicles budding from intracytoplasmic membranes.Those bodies can be seen in axons, and it is in this way that virus spreads from the central nervous system to many organs of the body.Because Negri bodies are usually seen in intact neurons, they are found away from the inflammatory, nonspecific lesions. Rabies viral antigens can be demonstrated in infected cells by means of fluorescent antibody technique.Antigens can be shown to be present in cells in the absence of Negri bodies, and hence this technique is much more sensitive than the search of sections of brain for the pathognomonic cytoplasmic inclusions.",

B: Presence of IgM anti-HBc in serumAlthough HBsAg is the earliest virological marker in serum of patients with acute hepatitis B, it does not help in establishing the diagnosis of acute Hepatitis B infection (it may be seen in chronic cases or carrier state)It is the presence of IgM anti-HBc that confirms an acute Hepatitis B infectionHBsAgThe hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection.However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host.Anti-HBc IgMThe infectious virion contains an inner \"core paicle\" enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core paicle is made of 180 or 240 copies of core protein, alternatively known as hepatitis B core antigen, or HBcAg.During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease.HbeAg and anti-HBeSholy after the appearance of the HBsAg, the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) will appear.Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivityDuring the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (anti-HBe) will arise immediately afterwards.This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication.Anti-HBs and anti-HBc IgGIf the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBsAg will become undetectable and will be followed by IgG antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen, (anti-HBs and anti HBc IgG).The time between the removal of the HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the window period.A person negative for HBsAg but positive for anti-HBs has either cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously.Hepatitis B carriersIndividuals who remain HBsAg positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers.Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and inflammation of the liver, as revealed by biopsy.Carriers who have seroconveed to HBeAg negative status, paicularly those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others.PCR testsThey have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens.These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment.Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy.",

        "question": "A 2 year old child with leukemia develops nephrotic syndrome. Light microscopic studies are normal. Electron microscopic studies demonstrate fusion of epithelial foot processes. The current hypothesis for the pathogenesis of this change is that it is secondary to which of the following?",
        "exp": "The child is suffering from minimal change or nil disease (lipoid nephrosis), which has a peak incidence at 2-3 years of age. Minimal change disease can be associated with food allergies, medications, or hematologic malignancies, or it can occur idiopathically. The pathology does not appear to involve complement, immunoglobulins, or immune complex deposition. Rather, an altered cell-mediated immunologic response with abnormal secretion of lymphokines by T cells is thought to reduce the production of anions in the glomerular basement membrane, thereby increasing the glomerular permeability to plasma albumin through a reduction of electrostatic repulsion. The loss of anionic charges is also thought to or foot process fusion. Some authors have noted that other conditions associated with T-cell abnormalities, such as Hodgkin's disease and T-cell lymphoma, are sometimes associated with minimal change disease. Consumption of complement factors is observed in many conditions in which complement activation occurs, for example, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. IgG directed against renal and pulmonary basement membranes is found in Goodpasture's syndrome, a cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and hemoptysis. Immune complex deposition is associated with type III hypersensitivity reactions,including postinfectious glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, cryoglobulinemia, and bacterial endocarditis.

Necrosis only represents the morphological changes that occur after cell death. o These morphological changes (necrosis) is the result of 2 concurrent processes : ? 1.

(a) From the lysosomes of the dead cells themselves (Autolysis) (b) From the lysosomes of the immigrant leukocytes (Heterolysis) 2.

The internal iliac aeries also may be an impoant source of collateral hindgut and midgut perfusion in the presence of inferior mesenteric aerial occlusion. The most common cause of abdominal angina is atherosclerotic vascular disease (chronic process). The occlusive process commonly involves the ostia and a few proximal centimeters of the mesenteric vessels. Abdominal angina is defined as the postprandial pain that occurs in individuals with sufficient mesenteric vascular occlusive disease such that blood flow cannot increase enough to meet visceral demands.

Epithelial metaplasia Here one type of adult epithelium is replaced by another type of adult epithelium. It may be :? a) Squamous metaplasia It occurs most frequently in respiratory tract as a result of chronic irritation by cigarette smoking. The columnar epithelium is replaced by squamous epithelium. This squamous metaplasia represents an attempt by the host to repair or prepare an epithelial tissue that has been damaged by environmental toxicants with a more resistant tissue. Squamous metaplasia is also encountered in other location such as pancreatic duct (Vit A deficiency, stones in pancreatic duct), gall bladder (gall stones), urinary bladder (bladder calculi, Schistosomiasis), and in endocervix. Though the metaplasia is reversible, if influences that predispose to metaplasia is persistent, malignant transformation may occur in metaplastic epithelium. b) Glandular metaplasia Change of the squamous epithelium to glandular (columnar) epithelium. Development of Barrett's esophagus, i.e., Stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by gastric columnar epithelium. It is due to reflux of acid contents of stomach into esophagus. This necessitates the replacement of susceptible squamous epithelium of the lower third of esophagus with gastric acid resistant glandular epithelium. 2. Connective tissue metaplasia This transformation occurs between the mesodermally derived tissues i.e., one type of connective tissue is replaced by another type of connective tissue. This is characterized by conversion of fibroblast-derived soft tissue into muscle, Cailage or bone. Example-Bone formation in muscle i.e., myositis ossificans. Mechanism of metaplasia o Metaplasia is not due to change in differentiation between two terminally differentiated cells themselves. o Metaplasia results by disturbances in the cellular lineage in which precursor cells (Stem cells or undifferentiated mesenchymal cells) differentiate along a different pathway. o For example in tracheobranchial tree, the basal stem cells differentiate to yield ciliated columinar cells, but in chronic smokers, irritation causes a change in the normal differentiation process and stem cells differentiate through a different pathway to generate more resistant squamous epithelium.",

Effect of HbS on RBCs o In deoxygenated condition, the HbS molecules undergo polymerization and aggregation. o With continued deoxygenation, aggregated HbS molecules assemble into long needle-like fibers within red cells, producing a distoed sickle or holly-leaf shape. Sickling of red cells is reversible initialy, i.e., with oxygenation, HbS depolymerizes and cell shape normalizes. o However, with repeated episodes of deoxygenation and sickling, membrane damage occurs and cells become irreversibly sickled, and retain their abnormal shape even when full oxygenated. o With membrane damage water comes out of the cell resulting in intracellular dehydration ---> T MCHC. Due to membrane damage, sickle red cells become abnormally sticky --> responsible for microvascular occlusions.

        "exp": "Ans. is `d' i.e., Effective phagolysosome formation Chediakhigashi syndrome :?It is an autosomal recessive disorder.Chediakhigashi syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene.This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transpo of materials into lysosomes.Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins.During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias.Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome.Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation.As a result, most people with chediakhigashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, staing in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening.Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected.The other cells involved are - Melanosomes of melanocytes Dense bodies of platelets Granules of schwann cellsThere are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells.In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism-Le the colour of skin, hair and eye is reduced.Abnormality in platelets produce bleeding disorders.Defective granules in schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e.g. peripheral neuropathy.Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase, (lymphoma like stage).This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E.B.virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs.The accelarated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life threatening and lead to death.",

Since the granules need time to degrade, this implies nephron obstruction.o Waxy casts are seen in chronic renal diseases associated with renal failure seen in diabetic nephropathy, malignant hypeension, glomerulonephritis.",

The histopathological hallmark of Wegener's granulomatosis is necrotizing vasculitis of small aeries and veins together with granuloma formation which may be either intravascular or extravascular.

Granuloma formation is rarely seen in other organs. Other organs, only demonstrate necrotizing vasculitis. So Wegener's granulomatosis can also be defined as Granulomatous vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tracts together with glomerulonephritis. Bobbin's defines Wegener's granulomatosis as \"necrotizing vasculitis\" (not granulomatous vasculitis). According to Robbin's Wegener's granulomatosis is a necrotizing vasculitis characterized by a triad of :? - Acute necrotizing granuloma of upper respiratory tract (ear, nose, sinuses, throat) or the lower respiratory tract. - Necrotizing or granulomatous vasculitis affecting small to medium sized vessels (e.g. capillaries, venules, aeriole and aeria) most prominent in the lungs and upper airways but affecting other sites as well. - Renal disease in the .form of focal necrotizing often crescenteric glomerulonephritis.

The most recently discovered among this class of genes are that encode for gene-silencing RNAs, i.e. RNAs that do not encode proteins but instead inhibit gene expression (unlike classical RNAs which encode for proteins) Two gene-silencing RNAs are: Micro RNAs (miRNAs) Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 1. Micro RNA (miRNAs) Because of their profound influence on gene regulation, miRNAs are assuming central impoance in understanding normal developmental pathways, as well as pathologic conditions, such as cancer. o By current estimates there are approximately 1000 genes in humons that encodes miRNAs. Transcription of miRNA gene produces primary miRNA transcripts, which is processed within the nucleus to form another structure, called pre-miRNA. Pre-miRNA is transpoed to cytoplasm by a transpoor (Expo) protein. Dicer (an enzyme) does the additional cutting of this pre-miRNA that are about 21-30 nucleotide in length (hence called \"micro\"). At this stage mRNA is still double stranded. Next, the miRNA unwinds, and single strands of this duplex are incorporated into a multiprotein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Base-pairing between the miRNA strand and it target mRNA (messenger RNA) directs RISC to either cause mRNA cleavage or repress its translation. In this way, the gene from which the target was derived is silenced (at a post-transcription level). A single miRNA can silence many target genes. 2. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) siRNAs work in similar manner as miRNA Unlike miRNA, siRNA precursors are introduced by investigators into cells. siRNA are becoming powerful tools for studying gene function and may in the future be used therapeutically to silence specific genes, such as oncogenes, whose products are involved in neoplastic transformation.",

        "exp": "Reperfusion injury refers to myocardial vascular or electrophysiological dysfunction that is induced by the\u00a0restoration of blood flow to previously ischemic tissue.\no Manifestation includes:\n\nReperfusion arrhythmias.\nEndothelial cell damage leading to microvascular dysfunction,\nMyocardial stunning.\nMyocyte death and infarction.\n\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY-\nWhen blood flow to cardiac myocytes is disrupted by occlusion of a coronary artery, a series of events is set in\u00a0motion that results in cellular injury and death. These processes are largely related to energy production and\u00a0utilization and include the following :\n\nReduced energy production with a fall in intracellular ATP levels,\nA transition from aerobic to anaerobic energy utilization,\nAn accumulation of the products of anaerobic metabolism,\nReduced intracellular pH.\n\nFactors that contribute to reperfusion injury include the following :\n\nDamage to cellular and organelle membranes, including mitochondria,\nMyocyte hypercontracture.\nFree radical formation.\nAggregation of leukocytes and inflammatory mediators,\nPlatelet activation.\nComplement activation.\nActivation of the pro-apoptotic signalling cascade.\nEndothelium damage and vasoconstriction.\n\nOxygen and other free radicals -\n\nFree radicals are produced within a minute of reperfusion and continue to be generated for hours after the\u00a0restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissue.\nSuperoxide anion (O2)\nHydrogen peroxide (H2O2)\nHypochlorous acid (HClO)\nNitric oxide-derived peroxynitrite.\nHydroxyl radical (OH)\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed for the development of these free radicals including xanthine oxidase, activated neutrophils, electron leakage from ischemic mitochondrion, catecholamine oxidation, as well as\u00a0cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes.\nThe relative importance of each of these pathways is not clear, but they are probably interrelated and may\u00a0potentiate one another.\nFree radicals damage myocytes directly by altering membrane proteins and phospholipids. Because these\u00a0membrane constituents play crucial roles as receptors, enzymes, and ion channels, free radical injury can\u00a0lead to fatal metabolic and structure derangements. As an example, oxygen radicals inure the\u00a0sarcolemma and may impair the contractile function of the myocyte on this basis. The role for free radicals\u00a0as a source of significant myocardial damage is further supported by studies showing that free radical\u00a0scavengers, such as superoxide dismutase, administered during thrombolytic therapy help preserve\u00a0myocardial function. Finally, reactive oxygen species stimulate leukocyte activation, chemotaxis, and\u00a0leukocyte-endothelial adherence.",

Hemoglobin concentration o The rate of HbS polymerization is strongly dependent upon the hemologbin concentration per cell i.e., MCHC. o Higher HbS concentration increase the probability that aggregation and polymerization will occur during any given period of time. o Thus, intracellular dehydration, which increases the MCHC, faciliatates sickling. o Conversly, conditions that decrease MCHC reduce disease severity e.g., when sickle cell anemia occurs with athalassemia 3. Deoxygenation with HbS o Polymerization of HbS occurs only in deoxygenated state. o A decrease in pH reduces the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, thereby increasing the fraction of deoxygenated HbS at any given oxygen tension and augmenting the tendency of sickling. 4. The length of time red cell are exposed to low oxygen tension. o Normal transient times for red cells passing through capillaries are not sufficient for significant aggregation of deoxygenated HbS to occurs. o Hence, sickling of red cells is confined to microvascular beds where blood flow is sluggish. o This is normally the case in spleen and bone marrow which are predominantly affected by sickle cell disease.",

Abnormal number of chromosomes o There are 23 pairs of chromosomes (46, XX in females and 46, XY in males). o An exact multiple of the 23 (haploid number) is called euploidy. o When the number of chromosomes are not an exact multiple of 23, it is referred as aneuploidy. eg - Trisomy or monosomy. Pathogenesis of aneuploidy o In aneuploidy error either in meiosis or in mitosis. (a) Error in meiosis o It is the most common cause of aneuploidy. o The usual causes are nondisjunction or anaphase lag. o In nondisjunction, chromosomal pair fails to separate in first meiotic division during gametogenesis, so one gamete has an extra chromosome (n+1) and the other has one less chromosome (n-1). Feilization of such gametes with normal gamete results in two types of zygotes - trisomy (2n+1) or monosomy (2n-1). o In anaphase lag, one chromosome lags behind and is left out of the cell nucleus. The result is one gamete with normal chromosomes (n) and other gamete with one less chromosome (n-1). Feilization in two types of zygote -4 normal (2n) or monosomy (2n-1). (b) Error in Mitosis o Error in mitosis in early development give rise to two or more different types of populations in the same individuals, a condition referred as mosaicism. o Mosaicism affecting the sex chromosome is common. o In the division of an feilized ovum, an error may lead to one of the daughter cell receiving three sex chromosomes, where as the other recieves only one, yielding, a 45, X/47, XXX mosaic. That means the same individual will have both types of cells cells having 45, X and cells having 47, XXX. Then what is the difference between Monosomy / trisomy and mosachism ? Trisomy/monosomy are due to defect in meiosis and before feilization, so that after feilization all cells have same number of chromosome either monosomy or trisomy. In mosaicism, defect is in mitosis and after feilization so that same individual has cells of two different population eg. 45, X and 47, XXX. 2. Abnormal structure of chromosome o Chromosomal structural changes usually result from chromosome breakage followed by loss or rearrangement. o Beside these chromosomal structural abnormalities some autosomal recessive genetic disorders are associated with such a high level of chromosomal instability that they are known as chromosomal breakage syndrome --> Ataxia - telangiectasis, bloom syndrome, and fanconi anemia. There is significantly increased risk of cancer in these syndromes.",

Serum ferritin o Most of the ferritin is stored is different organs (liver, spleen, bone marrow). o Very small amounts of ferritin normally circulate in the plasma. Since plasma ferritin is derived largely form the storage pool of body iron, its level correlate well with body iron stores. i.e., when there is iron depletion, body store of iron is reduced that inturn leads to decrease in plasma ferritin. Transferrin saturation and iron binding capicity 3 Iron is transpoed in the plasma by transferrin. o Normally transferrin is 33% saturated (77% free) with iron, yield serum iron levels that average 100-120 g/dl. So, if serum transferrin will be 100% saturated the serum iron will be 300 g/dl. that means the total iron binding capacity of transferrin is 300 to 350 g/dl. o When iron store is depleted e.g., in iron dificiency anemia, there is increased synthesis of transferrin that results in increased total iron binding capacity. o When iron store is repleted e.g., anemia of chronic disease, there is decreased synthesis of transferrin that results in decreased total iron binding capacity. Serum transferrin receptors Erythroid precursors have receptors for transferrin by which they recieve iron from transferrin that is utilized for hemoglobin synthesis. o When erythroid precursors mature, these receptors are shed into plasma and can be masured as serum transferrin receptors concentration. o In iron deficiency state, there is increased erythropoisis in bone marrow --> T concentration of erythroid precursor that results in increased total number of transferrin receptor T serum transferrin receptor concentration.",

Their shape is determined by the external environment of the cell, the metabolic activity of the cell, the nature of hemoglobin, the membrane skeleton, and age of the cell. The red blood cell's durability and flexibility are due to its submembranous protein network, the membrane skeleton. The membrane skeleton consists predominantly of four proteins: spectrin, actin, protein 4.1, and ankyrin (also known as syndein). Spectrin is an extrinsic protein located on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. It is long and unusually flexible molecule consisting of two structurally and functionally distinct polypeptide chains. The membrane of the RBC comprises a phospholipid bilayer and an underlying two-dimensional network of spectrin molecules. The composite propeies of the phospholipid bilayer and spectrin network result in the biconcave or discocyte morphology of healthy RBCs and give the membrane its elastic and biorheological propeies.

It is defined pathologically as an abnormal permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by the destruction of alveolar walls and without obvious fibrosis. It frequently occurs in association with chronic bronchitis. Patients have been classified as having COPD with either emphysema or chronic bronchitis predominance. The 3 described morphological types of emphysema are centriacinar, panacinar, and paraseptal. Centriacinar emphysema begins in the respiratory bronchioles and spreads peripherally. Also termed centrilobular emphysema, this form is associated with long-standing cigarette smoking and predominantly involves the upper half of the lungs. - Panacinar emphysema destroys the entire alveolus uniformly and is predominant in the lower half of the lungs. Panacinar emphysema generally is observed in patients with homozygous alfal antitrypsin deficiency. In people who smoke, focal panacinar emphysema at the lung bases may accompany centriacinar emphysema. - Paraseptal emphysema, also known as distal acinar emphysema, preferentially involves the distal airway structures, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs. The process is localized around the septae of the lungs or pleura. Although airflow frequently is preserved, the apical bullae may lead to spontaneous pneumothorax.

        "exp": "Nutmeg liver is the term given to the transected appearance of the liver in cases of chronic venous congestion (CVC), the alternate dark brown and yellow areas resemble a nutmeg. The yellow area represents area of centrilobular necrosis due to anoxia and the dark red ares represent sinusoidal congestion in the rest of the liver lobule. In chronic cases, fibrous bands can extend from the central vein in zone 3 to the poal tract which looks very much like cirrhosis but is termed cardiac sclerosis and differs from the bridging fibrosis seen in advanced liver disease where the fibrous bands form bridges between poal tracts. The most common etiologies for congestive hepatopathy are constrictive pericarditis, mitral stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, and cor pulmonale.

FDP's can also contribute to bleeding because they impair fibrin clot formation and interfere with platelet function. Clinical Features of D.I.C. o In D.I.0 the most obvious clinical symptom is bleeding. There is abrupt onset of bleeding in the form of ecchymoses or petechiae. o Bleeding from sites of venipuncture. o Gum bleeding, epistaxis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage State of shock may develop. o Acute renal failure is not uncommon.

Glycogen is viually absent from the hepatocytes in biopsy specimen. Mitochondrias are large pleomorphic and have decreased matricial density on electron microscopy. The kidney changes include swelling and fatty degeneration of proximal tubules. Astrocyte edema and loss of neuron in the brain. Reyes syndrome It is an acute self limiting metabolic insult of diverse etiology resulting in generalised nzitochondrial dysfunction due to inhibition of fatty acid )8 oxidation. Salicylates or viral infection can precipitate this metabolic impairment. The pathogenesis is thought to be damage to mitochondria caused by salicylate metabolite or some other toxin or chemical in the setting of viral infection. The reasons for mitochondria' dysfunction are unknown. No toxic factor has yet been conclusively identified but studies have suggested an etiological link among Reye's syndrome. The activities of hepatic mitachondrial enzymes including ornithine transcarbamylase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and pyruvate dehydrogenase are reduced often to less than half their normal values. Mitochondria' dysfunction leads to elevated sho chain fatty acids and hyperanzmonenzia as well as directly to cerebral edema. It is prudent to avoid the use of aspirin as an antipyretic in pediatric patients with influenza or varicella. Clinical manifestations:- Classic Reyes syndrome exihibits a stereotypic biphasic course. It usually occurs in a previously healthy child. A prodromal febrile illness, an upper respiratory tract infection or chicken pox is followed by an interval in which the child has seemingly recovered. The abrupt onsent of protracted vomiting then occurs usually within 5-7 days after the onset of viral illness. Delirium, combative behaviour and stupor may occur simultaneously within a few hours after the onset of vomiting. Neurological symptoms may rapidly progress to seizures, coma and death; focal neurological signs are absent.

Pylori infection. o The most striking evidence linking H. Pylori gastritis to MALToma is that eradication of infection by antibiotics induces durable remission with low rate of recurrence. o Gastric lymphoma represents 5% of all gastric malignancies. It is most prevalent is sixth decade of life. o Like other tumors of mature B cells, MALTomas express B-cell markers CD 19 and CD 20. They do not express CD 5, CD 10 and CD 23. o Diagnosis is made by endoscopic biopsy. o Gastric lymphomas are chemosensitive and chemotherapy alone or along with surgery is used for the treatment of gastric lymphoma.

Note:Constrictive pericarditis is due to any pathologic process that results in fibrous thickening of the pericardium, with resultant impaired compliance. Clinically, therefore, this condition manifests with a picture similar to restrictive cardiomyopathy because of impaired diastolic filling. Constrictive pericarditis is usually caused by previous episodes of acute pericarditis, especially hemorrhagic, suppurative, and caseous pericarditis.Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by massive ventricular dilatation and may be caused by genetic alterations, myocarditis, toxic insults (alcohol), metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis), etc. Most cases are idiopathic. The main pathophysiologic alteration is impaired contractility. Most cases of hyperophic cardiomyopathy are familial and due to mutations in one of the genes encoding proteins of the sarcomeres, most frequently b-myosin heavy chain. This form of cardiomyopathy leads to asymmetric hyperophy of the left ventricle, with prominent thickening of the interventricular septum. In this case, too, impairment of ventricular compliance is the basic mechanism leading to reduced diastolic filling and hea failure. Ref: Stevenson L.W., Loscalzo J. (2012). Chapter 238.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Sickle cell disease In sickle cell anemia there is missense type of point mutation. Mutations A mutation is apermanant change in the DNA. Mutations that affect genii cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease. Mutations that affect somatic cells arc not transmitted to progeny but are impoant in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations. Mutations may be classified into three categories ? 1. Gene mutations The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations. These may of different types depending whether it involves complete gene or single base ? (a) Point mutation A single nucleotide base is subustituted by a different base. When a pyrimidine base is subustituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine Transition. When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa Transversion. This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i.e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product. Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation. Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in 13-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine. Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon. 3 Example is 13-thalassemia in which CAG codon in I3-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation. (b) Deletion and inseions Deletion or inseion of one or two base lead to alterations in the reading frame of the DNA strand --> frame shift mutation. If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three framshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized. (c) Trinucleotide repeat mutation Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide. In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain. For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG. 2.Chromosome mutation Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome. 3.Genome mutation Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e.g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",

Then what is the difference between formation of normal hemostatic plug and thrombosis ? When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses platelet and fibrin to form a blood clot as the first step to prevent blood loss - hemostasis. If that mechanism causes too much doting, a thrombus is formed i.e., exaggeration of hemostatic process leads to thrombus formation. In other terms, hemostasis is a self limited process i.e., there is spontaneous resolution of hemostatic plug with subsequent repair of the injury, while thrombosis is not self limited and the thrombotic clot does not undergo resolution spontaneously rather it causes obstruction to blood flow. Thrombosis may occur without injury (e.g., in hypercoagulable state), while hemostatic plug is formed only after injury. Pathogenesis of thrombosis Thrombosis is caused by abnormalities in one or more of the following three (Virchow's triad) :? Vascular (endothelial) injury. Abnormal blood flow (stasis or turbulence). Blood hypercoagulability. How do these mechanisms lead to thrombosis? Endothelial injury with formation of clot has already been explained earlier. Blood hypercoagulability, as the name suggests, there is increase tendency of clot formation due to alteration in coagulation pathway that predisposes to thrombus. It may occur in many primary (genetic) or secondary (acquired) conditions. Disturbances in blood flow Stasis- Stasis is the major factor in the development of venous thrombus. Turbulence contributes to aerial and cardiac thrombosis. Normal blood flow is laminar such that the platelets flow centrally in the vessel lumen, separated from the endothelium by a slower-moving clear zone of plasma. Stasis and turbulence leads to thrombosis by ? Disruption of laminar flow brings platelets into contact with endothelium. Prevent dilution of activated clotting factors by fresh flowing blood. Retard the inflow of clotting factor inhibitors. Turbulence can cause endothelial injury or dysfunction.",

Prehepatic jaundiceo Prehepatic jaundice is due to increased production of bilirubin which results an increased bilirubin load presented to the liver.o The liver is normal and is able to conjugate the bilirubin at a normal rate; However, due to overproduction of bilirubin, conjugation capacity of liver is overwhelmed and unconjugate bilirubin is increased --) Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.o Prehepatic jaundice is caused by hemolysis, i.e., hemolytic anemia due to any cause, e.g., hereditary spherocytosis, Thalassemia, SCA, Malaria, Drugs (methyldopa, quinine) etc.Hepatic jaundiceo Here the cause lies within the hepatocytes which have either a defect in the conjugation process or in the excretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile.o This type of jaundice is caused by all causes of hepatitis (infection, alcohol, drugs, toxin or autoimmune); in congenital hyperbilirubenemias; and in cirrhosis.Post hepatic (extrahepatic) jaundiceo Post hepatic jaundice is due to obstruction of the excretion into the bile, e.g., in stone in CBD, carcinoma pancreas, CBD carcinoma etc.o Conjugation capacity of hepatocytes are normal and they continue their conjugation process without any interference leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.",

So, how is it possible for hypogammaglobulinemia to occur in multiple myoloma.J In about one quaer of patients with multiple myeloma only light chains are produced. These light chains are called Bence Jones protein. The characteristic feature of these light chains is that they are very small and are rapidly excreted in the urine. So all the abnormal immunoglobulin that is secreted in multiple myeloma is excreted.o Another point, which should be kept in mind is that the normal plasma cells in a patient with myeloma are not capable of immunoglobulin synthesis. So a situation develops where all the abnormally synthesized immunoglobulin by the neoplastic cells is excreted where as the remaining normal plasma cells are incapable of normal immunoglobulin synthesis. Thus, there is little immunoglobulin left in the serum causing hypogammaglobulinemia.o Renal failure may occur because of hypercalcemia, damage by Bence Jones protein, urate nephropathy an Amyloidosis (AL type).o ESR is increased due to hyperviscosity.",

C: Megaloblastic anemiaThe diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is based on leucopenia with hypersegmented granulocytes, a moderate to severe Megaloblastic anemia, elevated levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid in the serum and low serum vitamin B12.Hypersegmented neutrophilNormally, the number of segments in the nucleus of a neutrophil increases as it matures and ages, after being released into the blood from the bone marrow.Whereas normal neutrophils only contain three or four nuclear lobes (the \"segments\"), hypersegmented neutrophils contain five or more lobes.Hypersegmented neutrophils have classically been thought to be pathognomonic of the megaloblastic anemias (anemias caused by failure of bone marrow blood-forming cells to make DNA, often caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies, or DNA-replication poisons).One of the earliest, notable changes in the peripheral blood in megaloblastic processes is the appearance of hypersegmented neutrophils.Because of the sho life-span of neutrophils, these abnormal hypersegmented neutrophils characteristically appear even before the onset of anemia in megaloblastic processes.Such neutrophils are less often seen in the other classes of anemia, which together are far more common than megaloblastic types of anemia.Note that pernicious anemia is a type of megaloblastic anemia, and as such, is expected to show hypersegmented neutrophils.",

        "question": "Hypocalcemia is seen with which of the following: September 2008",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Acute pancreatitis Hypoalbuminemia is the most common cause of hypocalcemia and is due to cirrhosis, nephrosis, malnutrition, burns, chronic illness, and sepsis. Hypomagnesemia causes end-organ resistance to PTH and inhibits the hypocalcemic feedback loop through unceain mechanisms. Causes of hypomagnesemia include pancreatitis, aminoglycoside treatment, amphotericin B, loop diuretics, alcoholism, and malnutrition. Hyperphosphatemia may be seen in critical illness and in patients who have ingested phosphate-containing enemas. Phosphate binds calcium avidly, causing acute hypocalcemia. Multifactorial causes are probably the most clinically relevant hypocalcemic emergencies include the following: - Acute pancreatitis: Free fatty acids chelate calcium, causing saponification in the retroperitoneum. - Rhabdomyolysis: Increased phosphates from creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and other anions (i.e., lactate, bicarbonate) chelate calcium. - Sepsis can cause hypocalcemia through many mechanisms. - Toxic shock syndrome can cause hypocalcemia. High calcitonin levels cause low calcium. - Malignancy: Osteoblastic metastases (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer) and tumor lysis syndrome may cause hypocalcemia (by differing mechanisms). - Hepatic or renal insufficiency: Calciuresis, hypomagnesemia, hypoalbuminemia, and low active vitamin D levels may contribute to poor calcium homeostasis. - Infiltrative disease: Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and hemochromatosis may infiltrate the parathyroids, causing dysfunction. -- Toxicologic causes include hydrofluoric acid burn or ingestion. Enhanced protein binding and anion chelation - Protein binding is enhanced by elevated pH and free fatty acid release in high catecholamine states. Anion chelation is seen in high phosphate states (e.g., renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, mesenteric ischemia, oral administration of phosphate-containing enemas); high citrate states (e.g., massive blood transfusion, radiocontrast dyes); and high bicarbonate, lactate, and oxalate levels. Medication effects - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid production resulting in reduced calcium absorption. - Selective serotonin inhibitors can have a calcium antagonistic effect on smooth muscle, paicularly vascular endothelium. - Calcitonin and bisphosphonates cause chelation and end-organ inhibition. - Phenobarbital and phenytoin enhance vitamin D catabolism and decrease calcium resorption in the gut. Foscarnet complexes with calcium. Fluoride, paicularly hydrofluoric acid, chelates calcium avidly and causes profound hypocalcemia. Ethylene glycol complexes with calcium. Estrogen inhibits bone resorption. Cimetidine decreases gastric pH, slowing fat breakdown, which is necessary to complex calcium for gut absorption. Aluminum and alcohol suppress PTH. Gadolinium-based contrast material can falsely lower serum calcium levels and should be considered if levels are drawn sholy after magnetic resonance imaging. Postsurgical effects Parathyroid adenoma resection causes a transient hypocalcemia due to end-organ PTH resistance in the first postoperative day. Pancreatectomy prevents calcium absorption in the duodenum and the jejunum by eliminating necessary enzymes. Small bowel syndrome causes hypocalcemia by reducing the surface available to absorb fatty acids and calcium. PTH deficiency/resistance Infiltrative diseases include Wilson disease and metastatic cancer. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is due to PTH resistance and has many forms, most notably Albright disease. Renal failure can result in a variety of endocrine disorders, occasionally including hypocalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency/resistance - Rickets may be due to lack of vitamin D or end-organ receptor resistance. - Hepatorenal disease: The liver and the kidney provide intermediary enzymes to form active 1,25 (OH)2 D.",

Endothelial injury\n\nEarliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade.\nInflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornerstone in the development of atherosclerosis.\nAfter the injury, the endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 and there is increased permeability to endothelium.\nTNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression.\n\n2. Migration of leukocytes\n\nWhen VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium.\nLeukocytes then cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space.\nMacrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells -> formation of the earliest lesion, i.e. fatty streak.\nMacrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modified LDL).\n\n3. Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation\n\nInflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-\u03b1 and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation.\n\n4.

        "exp": "Ans. is `b' i.e., Angleman syndrome o Don't get confused by previous explanations, where I have explained the deletion of paternal chromosome 15 in Prader Willi Syndrome. o To understand this question, one should know genomic imprinting as well as uniparental disomy. Genomic imprinting o A person inherits two copies of their genes one_ form their mother and one from their father Usually both copies of each gene are active or \"turned on\" in cells.. o In some cases however only one of the two copies is turned on. o Which copy is active depends on the parent of origin. Some genes are normally active only when they are inherited from a person's father. Others are active only when inherited from a person's mother. o This phenomenon is known as genomic imprinting. In genes that undergo genomic imprinting, the parent of origin is often marked or \"stamped\" on the gene during the formation of egg and sperm cells. This stamping process called methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to ceain segments of DNA. These molecules identify which copy of a gene was inherited from the mother and which was inherited from father. The gene that are imprinted or stamped are \"silent\"i.e.,they do not remain functional. Uniparental disomy (UDP) o Normally a person inherits one copy of each chromosome pair from biological mother and the other copy of the chromosome pair from biological father. Uniparental disomy occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome from the same parent and no copies from the other parent. o UDP can occur as random event during the formation of egg or sperm cells or may happen in early fetal development. Example of Genomic imprinting and UDP The classical examples are Prader -Willi syndrome and Angleman syndrome. Prader-Willi syndrome o Approximately 70% of affected individuals have a small deletion on long arm ofparenteral chromosome 15,i.e. paternal genomic imprinting. There is silencing of paternal gene due to deletion.. Paternal gene Silenced (Paternal genomic imprinting) Maternal gene Only functional alle present o The remaining 30% of patients have maternal uniparenteral disomy for chromosome 15. That is they have two otherwise normal copies of maternal chromosome 15 and no paternal 15. o Thus Prader Willi syndrome ( in both above situations) results from the absence of paternal contribution to this region of chrmosome 15, whether by paternal deletion ( paternal genomic imprinting) or maternal UPD. Angleman syndrome o Most of the affected individuals have deletion on maternal chrmosome 15,i.e. maternal genomic imprinting. There is silencing of maternal gene due to deletion. Maternal gene Silenced (Maternal genomic imprinting) Paternal gene Only functional allel present o The remaining patients have paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 15, i.e., they have two otherwise normal copies of paternal chromosome 15 and no maternal 15. o Thus Angleman syndrome results from the absence of maternal contribution to this region of chromossome 15, whether by maternal deletion ( maternal genomicimprinting) or paternal UDP.

This process operates in the cell cycle at G1 and G2 phases before the cell enters the S or M phase.\n\nBecause of these significant roles in cell cycle, p53 is called as 'protector of the genome\u2019.\nMohan H.

Other rare type of polyps are --> Fundic gland polyps, Peutz - Jegher polyps, Juvenile polyp, and Inflammatory fibroid polyp (eosinophlic granuloma).Following information have been added in Pie of Robbins o Hyperplastic polyps are also referred to as inflammatory polyps as they develop in association with chronic gastritis, which initiates the injury and reactive hyperplasia that leads to polyp growth.o Hypeplastic polyp occurs between 50-60 years of age.o Among individuals with H.Pylori gastrititis, polyp may regress after bacterial eradication.o Because the risk of dysplasia correlates with size, polyps larger than 1.5 cm should be resected and examined histologically.o The prevelance offundic gland polyps has increased markedly in recent years as a result of proton pump inhibitor therapy. This likely reflects increased gastrin secretion in response to reduced gastric acidity and the resulting glandular hyperplasia.",
