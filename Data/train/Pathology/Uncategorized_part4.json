The type of Ischemic heart disease depends on the type of changes that develop in this atheromatous plaque. 1. Fixed atherosclerosis with no change in structureo A fixed obstruction of 75% or greater generally causes symptomatic ischemia induced by excercise --> classical angina. o With this degree of obustruction, the augmented coronary flow provided by compensatory vasodilatation is no longer sufficient to meet even moderate increase in myocardial demand. o A 90% stenosis can lead to inadequate blood flow even at rest. 2. Disruption of plaque and acute coronary syndromeo In most patients with MI, unstable angina, and sudden cardiac death, the attack is precipitated by abrupt plaque change (plaque disruption) followed by thrombosis. o Acute plague change (plaque disruption) may be any of the following types? (a) Rupture/fissuring, exposing highly thrombogenic plaque constituents to blood. (b) Erosion/ulceration, exposing the thrombogenic subendothelial basement membrane to blood. (c) Hemorrhage into the plaque, expanding its volume. o All these changes lead to exposure of the thrombogenic constituents of plaque or vessel wall, this in turn activates platelets and there is platelets aggregation with formation of thrombus. o This can precipitate following acute coronary syndrome -(i) If thrombus occludes the vessel completely --> Transmural myocardial infarction. (ii) If thrombus occludes the vessel paially (incomplete) --> Unstable angina or acute subendocardial infarction. (iii) Paial occlusion by thrombus with possible embolus led to regional myocardial ischemia that induces a fatal ventricular arrhythmia --> sudden cardiac death. 3. Vasoconstriction at sites of atheromatous plaqueo Vasoconstriction at sites of atheromatous plaque causes stenosis above a critical level and pain at rest. o This is the pathogenic mechanism in Prinzmetal variant angina.",

Chronic bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is defined as a persistent cough with sputum production for at least 3 months in at least 2 consecutive years, in the absence of any other identifiable cause. It is strongly associated with smoking. Morphological changes in chronic bronchitis The earliest feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus in the larger airways, associated with hypertrophy of submucosal gland of trachea and bronchi. Although the numbers of glands increase slightly, the major increase is in the size of mucous glands. This increase can be assessed by Reid index which is the ratio of between the thickness of the submucosal glands to that of the bronchial wall. The Reid index (normal 0. 4) is increased in chronic bronchitis. Later, small airways (small bronchi and bronchioles) are also involved and show goblet cell hyperplasia, and intraluminal and peribronchial fibrosis. In most severe cases, there may be obliteration of lumen due to fibrosis -> Bronchiolitis obliterans. The bronchial epithelium may undergo squamous metaplasia and dysplasia.",

The condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder and the mutations are mapped to the DLX gene located at chromosome 17q21. 3-q22. DLX gene plays a role in the development of craniofacial bone in the early embryogenesis. Later, it is expressed in structures that involve epithelial-mesenchymal interaction such as teeth, hair follicle, and skin. The dental findings include yellow-brown discoloration of teeth, enamel hypoplasia, and severe attrition of enamel. Such defective enamel may be a cause for commonly occurring dental abscesses. Wide pulp chamber (taurdontism), especially involving the molars, has been reported. Radiographic Features In dental X-rays, large pulp chambers are noticed, often in the molars. In addition, teeth may remain unerupted for long, leading to partial anodontia. Key Concept: A pattern of teeth alteration similar to amelogenesis imperfecta with taurodontism is seen in the systemic disorder, tricho-dento-osseous syndrome.

Aggressive lymphomas associated with HIV. These 3 types are histologically identical. Morphology The tumor exhibits a high mitotic index and contains numerous apoptotic cells, the nuclear remnants of which are phagocytosed by interspersed benign macrophages. These phagocytes have abundant clear cytoplasm, creating a characteristic \"starry sky\" pattern. Immunophenotype These are tumors of mature B cells. It express surface IgM, CD 19, CD20, CD 10 and BCL6. a phenotype consistent with a germinal center B-cell origin. Unlike other tumors of germinal center origin, this does not express anti-apoptotic protein BCL2. Molecular Pathogenesis All forms of Burkin lymphoma are associated with translocations of the c-MYC gene on chromosome 8. The translocation partner is usually the IgH locus light-chain loci. All endemic tumors are latently infected with EBV. which is also present in about 25% of HIVassociated tumors and 15% to 20% of sporadic cases. Clinical Features Endemic Burkitt lymphoma often presents as a mass involving the mandible and shows an unusual predilection for involvement of abdominal viscera, particularly the kidneys, ovaries and adrenal glands. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma most often appears as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum. Burkitt lymphoma is very aggressive but responds well to intensive chemotherapy",

Progressive depletion of CD4+T cells in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Cell death in viral infections e. g, the formation of Councilman bodies in viral hepatitis. Pathologic atrophy of organs and tissues on withdrawal of stimuli e. g. prostatic atrophy after orchiectomy, atrophy of kidney or salivary gland on obstruction of ureter or ducts, respectively. Cell death in response to injurious agents involved in causation of necrosis e. g. radiation, hypoxia and mild thermal injury.

The rapid burst occurs due to rapid activation of the enzyme complex NADPH oxidase which oxidizes NADPH and in the process reduces oxygen to superoxide anion (0, -). It catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion which is then conveed to hydrogen peroxide and other toxic oxygen products (011-) (free radicals). H., 02 then combines with myeloperoxidase and halide to form an effective antibacterial compound. (HOCC-) Chronic granulomatous disorder Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder of phagocytes. Patients suffering from chronic granulomatous disease have leucocytes that ingest microbes normally but lack the fully functional NADPH oxidase system, required to produce the superoxide anion. In these patients there is no respiratory burst due to lack of one of the four NADPH oxidase subunits in neutrophils. Thus, these patients are not able to generate superoxide, H202 and OH- ions (free radicals). (Thus the), are not able to kill the bacterias). Leucocytes from the patients of chronic granulomatous disease fail to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium during phagocytosis. This propey has been used as a screening method for the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease. More on chronic granulomatous disease:- Inheritence - X linked (more common) - Autosomal recessive There is increased incidence of bacterial infection. The bacterias involved in recurrent infections are catalase positive pyogenic pathogens such as staphylococci and colifonns. Catalase negative pathogens are handled normally There is excessive inflammation with granuloma formation. Clinical features are? - Suppurative lyrnphadenopathy - Gingivitis - Aphthous ulceration - Seborrhic dermatitis - Obstruction of gastrointestinal or genitourinary system - Autoinimune complications - Immune thrombocytopenic purpura - Juvenile rheumatoid ahritis Tests for diagnosis Nitroblue tetrazolium test Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) oxidation test Immunoblot for NADPH oxidase components",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Early transient increase in permeability Increased vascular permeability o The hallmark of acute inflammation is increased vascular permeability The following mechanisms have ben proposed for increased permeability. i) Formation of endothelial gaps in venules (immediate transient response) This is the most common mechanism of vascular leakage and is caused due to the mediators such as histamine, bradykinin, leukotrienes, neuropeptide sustance Classically this type of leakage affects venules, leaving capillaries and aerioles unaffected. The precise reason for this restriction to venules is unceain, it may be because there is greater density of receptors for mediators in venular endothelium. Binding of mediators such as histamine to their receptors on endothelial cells activate intracellular signaling pathways that lead to phosphorylation of contractile and cytoskeletal proteins such as myosin. These proteins contract leading to contraction of endothelial cells and separation of intercellularjunction. Thus the gaps in the vascular endothelium are largely intercellular or close to the intercellular junctions. This type of leakage occurs rapidly after exposure to the mediator and is usually reversible and sho lived (15-30 minutes), it is thus known as immediate transient response. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon y also increase vascular permeability by inducing a structural reorganization of the cytoskeleton such that the endothelial cells retract from one another. In contrast to the histamine effect, the cytokine induced response is somewhat delayed (4-6 hrs) and long lived (24 hrs or more). Direct endothelial injury resulting in endothelial cell necrosis and detachment (immediate sustained response) This effect is usually encountered in necrotizing injuries and is due to direct damage to the endothelium by injurious stimulus e. g severe burns or lytic infections. The reaction is known as immediate sustained response because the leakage stas immediately after the injury and is sustained at high levels for several hours until the damaged vessels are thrombosed or repaired. o All levels of microcirculation are affected including venules, capillaries and aerioles. iii) Delayed prolonged leakage This is curious but relatively common type of increased permeability that begins after a delay of 2-12 hours, lasts for several hours or even days and involves venules as well as capillaries. This type of leakage is caused by mild to moderate thermal injury, X-ray radiation or ultraviolet radiation and ceain bacterial toxins. It is caused either by direct effect of injurious agent or by cytokine mediated endothelial retraction. iv) Leucocyte mediated endothelial injury Leucocytes adhere to endothelium relatively early in inflammation. These leucocytes may be activated releasing toxic oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes which then cause endothelial injury or detachment. This type of leakage affects venules (mostly); pulmonary & glomerular capillaries. v) Increased transcytosis across the endothelial cytoplasm Transcytosis occurs across channels consisting of clusters of interconnected uncoated vesicles and vacuoles called the vesiculovacuolar organelle, many of which are located close to intercellular junctions. It usually occurs in venules. vi) Leakage from new blood vessels During repair formation of new vessels occur (angiogenesis) New vessel sprouts, remain leaky until the endothelial cells mature.",

A diseased mother can transmit the abnormal X chromosome to both daughter and sons equally. Important facts If a female is transmitting the disease to all offspring's (both males and females) and a male is not transmitting the disease to any child, it is mitochondrial inheritance. If a male is transmitting the disease only to daughters (all daughters) and not to the sons whereas female transmit the disease to half daughters and half of the sons, it is X-linked dominant. If only males are affected in a pedigree, it is likely to be an X-linked recessive disease (females act as carriers; only transmit the disease and themselves remain unaffected). If there is no sex-predilection and affected individuals transmit the disease to half of the offspring's, it is an autosomal dominant disorder.

In colorectal cancer it is used for screening; response and follow up after surgery (CEA should diseapper in 6 weeks after resection), prognosis (higher levels suggests high tumor burden) and to see recurrence on follow up. CEA antigen has no correlation with hepatic metastasis. CEA lacks sensitivity as well as specificity, hence cannot be used to confirm the diagnosis. 2) Alpha-feto protein (AFP) It is a glycoprotein synthesized normally early in fetal life by yolk sac, fetal liver and fetal GIT. It is structurally and genetically related to albumin. AFP is raised in liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), lung carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and non-seminoma germ cell tumor of testis/ovary (yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor, embryonal carcinoma, teratoma). AFP is also raised in some non-neoplastic conditions like cirrhosis, hepatitis, and pregnancy. 3) Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) It is a placental hormone synthesized by syncytiotrophoblasts. It is glycoprotein with two subunits (dimer): a-subunit and /3-subunit. But only the P subunit of HCG is typically measured as a tumour marker because of specificity of the 13 subunit. The i3 subunit of HCG has unique sequences that are not shared with other human glycoprotein hormones. It is detected by radioimmunoassay using antibodies to the 13 chain. a-HCG is not used as tumour marker because a unit of the FSH, LH and TSH are identical. So there can be cross reactivity between a subunits of these hormone. That is why in case of testicular tumours the patients also undergo simultaneous assay of LH to be ceain that the marker detected is 13 HCG. HCG (13-HCG) is raised in gestational trophoblastic disease (hydatidiform moles), gonadal germ cell tumor (embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma), and pregnancy. 4) CA-125 Most impoant cancer with elevated CA-125 is epithelial ovarian cancer. CA-125 is also elevated in cancers of endometrium, cervix, fallopian tubes, pancreas, breast, lung and colon. Non-neoplastic conditions causing elevation of CA-125 are pregnancy, mensturation, endometriosis, PID, abdominal TB, peritonitis and uterine fibroid. Tumor markers for testicular/ovarian tumor AFP (alpha-feto protein): Teratoma, Yolk sac tumor (endodermal sinus tumor), embryonal carcinoma. HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin): Choriocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma. a, -antitrypsin: Yolk sac tumor (endodermal sinus tumor). Placental alkaline phosphatase: Seminoma.

These changes include blebbing, loss of cell membrane asymmetry and attachment, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis differs from necrosis, in which the cellular debris can damage the organism. Apoptosis in physiological conditions: - During embryogenesis - Involution of hormone-dependent tissues upon hormone withdrawl, such as endometrial cell breakdown during menstrual cycle, ovarian follicular atresia in menopause etc. - Cell loss in proliferating cell populations, such as immature lymphocytes in the bone marrow. Elimination of potentially harmful self-reactive lymphocytes",

        "exp": "The myelin sheath is formed by oligodendrocytes in CNS and by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The gaps formed between myelin sheath cells along the axons are called nodes of Ranvier. Since the lipid structure of myelin serves as a good insulator, the myelin sheaths increase the rate of propagation and efficacy of transmission of the impulse along the axon. The electrical impulse jumps from one node to the next at the rate as fast as 120 m/s. This rapid type of conduction is called saltatory conduction. Demyelination can occur early in life as consequence of congenital metabolic disorders. Demyelination later in life can be repaired with glia, which explains the frequent exacerbations and remissions in MS. It is believed that in MS, multiple mechanisms of immune injury of myelin coexist: cytokine-mediated injury of oligodendrocytes and myelin, digestion of surface myelin antigens by macrophages, complement-mediated injury, and direct injury by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This type of injury causes the loss of saltatory conduction in nerve fibers. The exposed axon is susceptible to fuher injury, resulting in irreversible axonal damage. Glial cells do not carry action potentials, but they have many impoant functions. There are several types of glial cells: astrocytes, which transpo nutrients to neurons, hold neurons in place, digest pas of dead neurons, and regulate the composition of extracellular space, and microglia, which possess phagocytic function, clean up debris, and protect the brain from microorganisms.

Stomach cancers are commonly adenocarcinomas (90%). Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (\"back to back\" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically \"empty\" spaces).

        "exp": "Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura There are two clinical subtypes of primary I. T. P, acute and chronic both are autoimmune disorders in which platelet destruction results from the formation of antiplatelet antibodies. Pathogenesis Chronic ITP is caused by the formation of autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoproteins most often IIb-IIIa or Ib-IX. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the antiplatelet antibodies are of the IgG class. The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar to that seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Opsonized platelets are rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. The spleen is the major site of the destruction of platelets. Pathology The principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic. The point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in the spleen, the spleen size remains normal. On histological examination, there is congestion of the sinusoids and hyperactivity and enlargement of the splenic follicles manifested by the formation of prominent germinal centres. Sometimes scattered megakaryocytes are found within the sinuses and sinusoidal walls. This represents a very mild form of extramedullary hematopoiesis. These splenic findings are not sufficiently distinctive to be considered diagnostic. Bone Marrow Bone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes. These findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction. The importance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure. A decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I. T. P.",

This test can be helpful in distinguishing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from cutaneous lupus, because in SLE the lupus band test will be positive in both involved and uninvolved skin, whereas with cutaneous lupus only the involved skin will be positive. The minimum criteria for positivity are: In sun-exposed skin: Presence of a band of deposits of IgM along the epidermal basement membrane in 50% of the biopsy, intermediate (2+) intensity or more. In sun protected skin: Presence of interrupted (i. e. less than 50%) deposits of IgM along the epidermal basement membrane, intermediate (2+) intensity or more.

INFARCTION An infarct is an area of ischemic necrosis by occlusion of either the aerial supply or venous drainage in a paicular tissue. Pathogenesis Mostly it is caused by interrupted blood supply. \"Nearly 99% of all infarcts results from thrombotic or embolic events and almost all result from aerial occlusion\". Other causes of interrupted aerial supply are local vasospasm, extrinsic compression of a vessel by tumor, twisting of vessel e. g., in testicular torsion, expansion of atheroma due to hemorrhage within the plaque. Venous obstruction usually cause congesion, edema, infarction does not occur because bypass channels rapidly open after the thrombus, providing some outflow from the area, which inturn improves aerial inflow. Infarct cause by venous thrombosis is more likely in organs with a single venous outflow channel, such as in testis and ovary. Types of infarct Infarcts are classified on the basis of their color. Infarcts are classified into either Red (Haemorrhagic) or White or Pale (anaemic) infarcts, reflecting the amount of haemorrhage. Red infarcts (Haemorrhagic): occur with: Venous occlusions (eg ovarian torsion); In loose tissues (such as lungs); In tissues with dual circulation (e. g. Lung & S. intestine) In tissues that were previously congested because of sluggish venous out flow. When flow is reestablilshed to a site of previous aerial occulusion and necrosis. White or Pale infarcts: occur with: Aerial occlusions, or In solid organs e. g. Heart, spleen, Liver, kidney and brain where the solidity of tissue limits the amount of haemorrhage that can seep into the area of ischaemic necrosis.",

In patients with adequate cardiovascular function, the bronchial aerial supply can often sustain the lung parenchyma despite obstruction to the pulmonary aerial system. Pulmonary embolism usually cause infarction only when the circulation is already inadequate as in patients with heart or lung disease. For this reason, pulmonary infarcts tend to be uncommon in the young. Consequences of pulmonary embolism o The effects of pulmonary embolism depend mainly on the size of the occluded vessel, the number of emboli, and on cardiovascular status of the patients. o The following consequences can result. Asymptomatic o Most pulmonary emboli (60% to 80%) are clinically silent because they are small. o With time, they undergo organization and are incorporated into the vascular wall. Sudden death (cardiovascular collapse) o Massive pulmonary embolism may result in instantaneous death, without occurence of chest pain and dyspnea. Acute cor pulmonale (Acute right heart failure) o Numerus small emboli may obstruct most of the pulmonary circulation resulting in acute heart failure. Pulmonary infarction o Embolic obstruction of small end-aeriolar pulmonary branches can cause pulmonary infarction. o About three fouhs of all infarcts affect the lower lobes, and in more than half, multiple lesions occur. o Characteristically, they extend to the periphery of the lung substance as a wedge with apex pointing toward the hilus of the lung. o The pulmonary infarct is classically hemorrhagic infarct.

Defination of atrophy has been changed in 8111/e of Robbins o Atrophy is reduced size of an organ or tissue resulting from a decrease in cell size and number.",

Preformed ABO antibodies (agglutinins) are present in persons serum when his RBCs lack the corresponding antigen (ie. anti B antibody would be present in a person of type A and type 0 blood groups. These two blood groups do not have the 'B' antigen on the RBCs)o This is not the case with other blood groups. Preformed antibodies are not present.

Mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) o The average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of packed red blood cells, expressed in grams per deciliter. Normal value is 33-37 gm/dl. MCHC is increased in hereditary spherocytosis, not because of increased hemoglobin, but due to decerase volume of spherocytes.

Hematocrit or Packed cell volume (PCV1 The propoion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells. Normal values are about 45% for men and about 42% for women. o A decrease in the number or size of red cells also decreases the amount of space they occupy, resulting in lower hematocrit. Similarly an increase in the number or size of red cells increases hematocrit. Exceptions are thalassemia which can cause an increased number of red blood cells but a decreased size and hematocrit, and megaloblastic anemia which causes increase in size of red cells with decreased hematocrit. Reticulocyte count ---->quantitative measure of the bone marrow's production of new red blood cells. Reticulocyte count is increased in anemia due to blood loss or anemia in which there is no defect in RBC production --> It is a responce to componsate anemia. o Reticulocyte count is decreased when there is anemia which has defect in RBC production, e. g. macrocytic (Vit B 12, folic acid deficiency) anemia, microcytic (iron def. anemia), Aplastic anemia.",

It is generally an idiopathic condition, probably related to pubeal hormonal changes. Fibrocystic changes in the breast, which reflect physiological responses in the breast to cyclical levels of sex hormones, are not observed in men. Fibrocystic changes are most common in the late reproductive years and include fibrosis, cyst formation, and a variety of epithelial changes such as hyperplasia and apocrine metaplasia. Intraductal papillomas are benign neoplasms commonly evolving in the major lactiferous ducts beneath the nipple. They most commonly present with a bloody nipple discharge and are rare in men. Carcinoma of the male breast is rare, and almost always develops in the breasts of elderly men. Male breast carcinomas have a somewhat worse prognosis than their female counterpa.

Pathophysiology Celiac disease is caused by the action of acidic peptides containing the gliadin fraction of wheat. The basic abnormality is thought to be an increased rate of loss of epithelial cells. Crypt cells show increased activity. This causes hypertrophy of crypt. But even this increased activity cannot keep pace with the loss of cells, resulting in a progressive decrease in height of villi causing villous atrophy The epithelial cells show decreased cytoplasm and mucus The intestinal biopsy shows a decrease in the villas: crypt ratio. Normally the villi are 3-4 times the height of the crypts (ratio of 3-4: 1); in celiac disease, the ratio decreases progressively (partial, subtotal and total villous atrophy).

However, the capillaries in the subcutaneous fat are aften involved in patients with systemic amyloidosis and can often provide sufficient tissues for the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Therefore, a needle aspiration biopsy of fat just under the skin of the belly (fat pad aspiration) offers a simple and less invasive method to diagnose systemic amyloidosis and biopsy of the organ with the most severe clinical involvement is often unnecessary. When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a final diagnosis, biopsy samples can be collected from other organs.

The traditional way of identifying amyloid in tissue sections has been staining with Congo red and demonstration of green birefringence under crossed polarizers. The original method of Congo red staining was described by Bennhold in 1922. The most common modification in the above technique is the alkaline Congo red method described by Puchtler and coworkers in 1962. Specificity is improved by using freshly prepared stain and a staining solution fully saturated with sodium chloride. Amyloid proteins can be fuher distinguished by autoclaving or by treating the tissue with potassium permanganate or alkaline guanidine. Other methods of detection of amyloid include fluorescent stains, e. g., thioflavin T or S, and metachromatic stains such as crystal violet. Immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase methods are used to identify and classify amyloid proteins in tissues. Antibodies against the P component, proteins AA and AL and FAP have been used with great precision. Due to cross-reactivity, these methods do not differentiate between some types of familial and senile systemic amyloidosis",

        "question": "Sweat chloride in cystic fibrosis?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Increased CYSTIC FIBROSIS Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease of the mucus and sweat glands. Cystic fibrosis follows on autosomal recessive transmission. There is a defect in ion transpo of epithelial cells that affects fluid secretion in Exocrine glands (pancreas) Epithelial lining of respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tract. Pathophysiologv In normal duct epithelia, chloride is transpoed by plasma membrane channels (chloride channels) The primary defect in cystic fibrosis results from abnormal function of an epithelial chloride channel protein encoded by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7q 31. 2. Protein encoded by CFTR is a chloride channel through which chloride passes In cystic fibrosis activity of chloride channel is decreased. Along with chloride channel, CFTR can regulate other channel also, for example epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). ENaC is inhibited by normally functioning CFTR; hence, in cystic fibrosis, ENaC activity increases, markedly augmenting sodium uptake across the apical membrane (especially in respiratory and gastrointestinal system). Normal CFTR gene product Defective (mutated) Crl R gene product in cystic fibrosis Induce Cl- conductance through itself (chloride channel) Reduced or lost Cl conductance Inhibits Na+ conductance through Augmented sodium uptake across apical membrane ENaC Clinical features of CF Functions of CFTR are tissue specific, i. e. its functions signify whether the epithelium is secretory (secrete Cl- into lumen) or absorptive (reabsorb Cl- from lumen). Therefore clinical features are tissue specific: Respiratory tract Respiratory epithelium is secretory, i. e. there is active secretion of C1-. CFTR mutation in cystic fibrosis results in loss or reduction of chloride secretion in lumen. Active luminal sodium absorption is also increased (due to loss of inhibition of ENaC activity) Both these decreased Cl secretion and increased Na+ absorption from lumen) lead to increased passive water reabsorption (As you all know diffusion of water occurs from high osmolar to low osmolar concentration area). This results in accumulation of dehydraded hyperconcentrated viscid secretion in respiratory lumen and defective mucociliary clearance obstruction and recurrent respiratory tract infection; and bronchiectasis. 1. Intestine Similar to respiratory epithelium, intestinal epithelium is secretory and in CF there is defective Cl- secretion andenhanced Na+ absorption from lumen - Increased passive reabsorption of water from lumen. This results in accumulation of dehydrated desciated intraluminal contents obstruction of small and largeintestine. Pancreas The absence of CFTR Cl channel in the apical membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelium limits the function of an apical membrane Ct -HCHD3 exchanger to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ (by a passive process) into the duct. The failure to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ leads to retention of enzyme in the pancreas and ultimately destruction of all pancreatic tissues due to pancreatitis. Hepatobiliary system Similar to respiratory and intestinal epithelium, defective biliar Cl- and water secretion causes thickened biliary secretions-biliary cirrhosis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis. Sweat glands In contrast to respiratory and intestinal epithelium, sweat gland duct epithelium is absorptive, i. e. function of normal CFTR in the sweat gland ducts is to reabsorb Cl- ions and Na' from lumen. Therefore, in the sweat ducts, loss of CFTR function leads to decreased reabsorption of Na. C1- Hypeonic sweat with increased Na+ and Ct in sweat.",

Damaged cells are attacked by macrophages in the spleen, where the precipitate and damaged membrane are removed, leading to characteristic \"bite cells\". The denaturing process is irreversible and the continual elimination of damaged cells leads to Heinz body anemia. G6.

Major presentation is bleeding (intestinal bleeding). Pathogenesis of angiodysplasia has been linked to mechanical and congenital factors:? 1. Mechanical factor Normal distension and contraction intermittently occlude submucosal veins and leads to dilatation and touosity of overlying vessels. Because cecum has the largest diameter, it develops the greatest wall tension. Therefore cecum is the most common site for angiodysplasia. 2.

Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogenic bone marrow transplantation but may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e. g. the liver) or transfusion of unirradiated blood. Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation. When such recipients receive normal bone marrow cells from allogenic donors, the immunocompetent, T cells present in the donor marrow recognizes the recipient's HLA antigen as foreign antigen and react against them.

Centriacinar (centrilobular) emphysema o Centriacinar emphysema is the most common type of emphysema seen clinically. o It is chracterized by involvement of respiratory bronchioles, i. e. central (proximal) pa of the acinus. o So, both emphysematous and normal airspaces exist within the same acinus and lobule. o The lesions are more common and more severe in the upper lobe, paicularly in the apical segments. o This is the type of emphysema that occurs predominantly in heavy smokers and usually coexists with chronic bronchitis. Panacinar (Panlobular) emphysema o The acini are uniformly enlarged from the level of the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli. o This type of emphysema tends to occur more commonly in the lower zones and in the anterior margins of the lung, and it is usually most severe at the base. o This type of emphysema is associated with al -antittypsin deficiency. Distal acinar (Paraseptal) emphysema o This type of emphysema involves distal pa of the acinus, while proximal pa is normal. o It is localized adjacent to the pleura, along perilobular septa. o The involvement is seen adjacent to areas of fibrosis, scarring, or atelectasis and is usually more severe in the upper half of lungs. o This type of emphysema is a common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults. 4. Irregular emphysema (Para-cicatricial emphysema) 3 The acinus is involved irregularly and is almost invariably associated with scarring. o It is the most common type of emphysema histologically. Note:? o There should be no confusion about the most common type of emphysema:? \"Irregular emphysema may be the most common form of emphysema\". Robbin's 8thie 684 \"Irregular emphysema may be the most common form of emphysema\". ________ Pathological basis of disease \"Irregular emphysema may be most common type of emphysema\".____ Thurlbeck's chronic airflow obstruction \"Irregular emphysema is always associated with scarring and is the most common form of emphysema\". Pathology of lung o However, this type of emphysema is not clinically significant as most patients remain asymptomatic and this type of emphysema is most frequent emphysema at autopsy. \"Irregular emphysema is at once the most common and least significant form of emphysema\". -- Pathology basic and systemic o On the other hand, centriacinar emphysema is the most common form of emphysema which is clinically significant, i. e. producing COPD. \"Centriacinar emphysema is the most common form of emphysema producing obstructive respiratory disease\".................................

The triple response of Lewis is due to the release of histamine. Histamine, or 2-(imidazol-4-yl) ethanamine, is a dibasic vasoactive amine that is located in most body tissues but is highly concentrated in the lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Histamine is derived from the decarboxylation of the aminoacid histidine, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme Lhistidine decarboxylase. Histamine is a small molecule, stored as granules in mast cells and basophils. Mast cells and basophils are the effector cells involved in the immediate hypersensitivity response. Explanation: Injected intradermally histamine elicits the triple response consisting of: - Red spot: due to capillary dilation - Flare: redness in the surrounding area due to aeriolar dilatation mediated by axon reflex. - Wheal: due to exudation of fluid from capillaries and venules",

MB (CK-MB), myoglobin, homocysteine, C-reactive protein (CRP), troponin T (c. TnT), and troponin I (c. TnI) are all used for assessment of the suspected acute myocardial infarction. CK-MB, c. TnT, and c. TnI may also be used to identify and manage high-risk patients. Normal results vary, based on the laboratory and method used. Total CK: The values begin to rise within four to six hours and peak at 24 hours. Values return to normal within three to four days. CK-MB: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 24 hours. Values return to normal within 72 hours. Troponin T: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 48 hours. Troponin I: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 48 hours. Myoglobin: The values begin to rise within one to two hours and peak at four to eight hours. Values return to normal within 12-24 hours. Homocysteine: Moderate, intermediate, and severe hyperhomocysteinemia refer to concentrations between 16 and 30, between 31 and 100, and less than 100 micromol/ L, respectively. C-reactive protein. Myoglobin is a protein found in both skeletal and myocardial muscle. It is released rapidly after tissue injury and may be elevated as early as one hour after myocardial injury, though it may also be elevated due to skeletal muscle trauma. However, if myoglobin values do not rise within three to four hours after a person shows acute symptoms, it is highly unlikely that he or she had an MI.",

The histocompatibility antigens (human leukocyte antigens - HLA) are cell surface antigens that induce an immune response leading to rejection of allogrufts. The principal physiologic function of the cell surface histocompatibility molecules is to bind peptide fragments of foreign proteins for presentation to antigen specific T cells. The histocompatibility antigens are encoded by a closely linked multiallelic cluster of genes, Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or Human leukocyte antigens complex (HLA complex). - HLA complex of genes is located on the sho arm of chromosome 6. It consists of three separate clusters of genes: HLA Complex [MHC Responses of MHC molecules Class 1 MHC class I molecules bind and process peptide that are derived from proteins synthesized within the cells, e. g. viral protein in viral infected cells and antigen of cancerous cells. These cells (cancerous or virus infected) have a tendency to display unusual, non self antigens on their surface. After binding to MHC-I, these antigens are processed and presented to cytotoxic CD-8 T cells (MHC-I restricted). Cytotoxic CD-8 T cell - MHC I reaction cause -- Graft rejection - Cell mediated cytolysis of viral infected or tumor cells. Class II Class 11 molecules present exogenous antigen (e. g. extracellular microbes, soluble proteins). These antigens are first internalized and undergo proteolytic cleavage in lysosome. Peptide generated. from this proteolytic cleavage are presented by MHC - II to CD4-T cells (MHC-II restricted). Reactions are: - Graft versus host response - Mixed leukocyte reaction Class III \"The MHC class HI region contains many genes that are good candidates for the involvement in autoimmune disease\".

As an aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions is the most common cause, organisms most commonly causing lung abscess are those normally found in the oral cavity, i. e., Anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, peptococcus species). Other organisms are S. aureus, Klebsiella, Nocardia and gram-negative bacteria.

A: Hyperophic cardiomyopathy In the case of chronic pressure overload as occurs with chronic hypertension or aoic valve stenosis, the ventricular chamber radius may not change; however, the wall thickness greatly increases as new sarcomere are added in-parallel to existing sarcomeres. This is termed concentric hyperophy. This type of ventricle becomes \"stiff\" (i. e., compliance is reduced), which can impair filling and lead to diastolic dysfunction. Sometimes the chamber radius is increased and the wall thickness is increased moderately - this is termed eccentric hyperophy - and can occur when there is both volume and pressure overload. An example of this would be when systolic dysfunction and a volume overload state occur in a concentrically hyperophied heart, thus stimulating chronic chamber dilation.

The affected leukocytes contain giant granules, which are readily seen in peripheral blood smears and are thought to result from aberrant phagolysosome fusion. In addition, there are abnormalities in melanocytes (leading to albinism), cells of the nervous system (associated with nerve defects), and platelets (causing bleeding disorders) The gene associated with this disorder encodes a large cytosolic protein called LYST, which is believed to regulate lysosomal trafficking.

They are also called \"large granular lymphocytes (LGL)\"as they contain large azurophilic cytoplasmic granules. They express Surface receptors for the Fc poion of IgG (CD-16) NCAM-I (CD56) They proliferate in response to IL-2 Many LGL express some lineage marker paicularly CD-8, CD-2. LGLs arise in both bone marrow and thymic microenvironment. Members of this group are: 1. Antibody dependent cytotoxic cells (ADCC) ADCC possess surface receptors for the Fc pa of Ig. Capable of lysing or killing target cells sensitized with IgG. 2. Natural killer cells (NK Cells) Possess spontaneous cytotoxicity towards various target cells: - Virus infected cells Malignant cells Transplanted foreign cells Cytotoxicity is not antibody dependent or MHC restricted Activity is nonimmune as it does not require sensitization by prior antigenic contact. They have CD-56 and CD-16 on their surface IL-2 acts as a growth factor Natural killer cell activity is augmented by interferon. They release perforin which causes transmembrane pores through which TNF-f3 enters the cell and induce apoptosis. NK cells are activated to LAK cells in the presence of IL-2 Usually CD-3 negative but subset of NK cells are CD-3 positive called NK/T cells. NK cells secrete TNF-a, GMCSF, perforin, IL-4. NK cells do not kill normal cells. Why is it so? lets see:? The NK cells express activating and inhibiting receptors. The functional activity of the NK cells is regulated by a balance between signal from these receptors. MHC class I molecules has inhibiting signal on NK cells and normal cell are not killed because inhibiting signals from normal MHC class I molecules overside activating signals. The ability of NK cells to kill target cells is inversly related to target cell expression of MHC class I molecule. If virus infection or neoplastic transformation reduces the expression of MHC I, inhibitory signals are interrupted and lysis of target cells occur. 3. Lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells These are NK - cells treated with IL-2 Kill tumor cells more efficiently than unstimulated NK cents.",

The junctional nevus represents an early stage, in which th\u00e8ques of nevus cells are confined to the junction of the epithelium and connective tissue, especially at the tips of the rete ridges. As the nevus cells proliferate, they begin to drop off into the underlying dermis or lamina propria. When nevus cells are present along the junctional area and within the connective tissue, the lesion is called a compound nevus. In later stages, the nevus cells are found only within the connective tissue. In the skin, this stage is called an intradermal nevus; the intraoral counterpart is called an intramucosal nevus. Most intraoral melanocytic nevi are classified microscopically as intramucosal nevi. However, this finding probably reflects the age (average, 35 years) at which most oral nevi undergo biopsy and diagnosis, because these lesions would have evolved earlier through junctional and compound stages.

        "question": "Best predictor for coronary aery disease a. EUR'",
        "exp": "LDL???? Elevated LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol are independent predictors of coronary heart disease. - Although there is consensus regarding the benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol the value of elevating HDL cholesterol remains controversial. Low HDL and coronary risk High serum HDL cholesterol is associated with a lower risk of CHD. The incidence of CHD events in a normal population appears to be inversely related to serum HDL cholesterol with low levels being associated with increased coronary risk. - Based upon data. from the Framingham Heart study, the risk for myocardial infarction increases by about 25%. for every 5mg/d1 (. 13 nuno1/1) decrement in serum HDL cholesterol. Elevated LDL and coronary risk Elevation in LDL cholesterol is a well known risk factor for the development of coronary aery disease. Association of elevated LDL with coronary aery disease has been established in various trials and studies. There is linear reduction in cardiovascular disease with progressive lowering of the LDL cholesterol. Traditionally LDL levels are considered to be the nzost impoant factor in the prediction of coronary aery disease. The impoance of LDL as a risk factor lies in the fact that effective therapes are avalaible to lower it, while it is not so in the case of HDL. So when treating dyslipidemia for reducing cardiovascular events, the. first target is LDL and not HDL. Doubt and Controversy What is creating doubts in our mind is a table from Braunwald 8th/e p1008 according to which 'Low HDL' appears to be better marker, for prediction of future cardiovascular disease than 'High LDL'. According to this bar diagram in Braunnwald 8\"Ye p1008 - the adjusted hazard ratio. for. future cardiovascular events for LDL is 1. 62 while that of HDL is 2. 32. But the text given in the book does clarify which one is better marker. (we have give this table from Braunwald in our previous discussion on this topic in Nov 2009 Medicine). We have tried to confirm this low HDL' fact from various other books. But none of the texts clearly. ored any one between these 2 to be the better marker. Both LDL and HDL are mentioned to be impoant. We have also consulted several cardiologist on this. All of them say that the answer should be LDL Well, Braunwald is text book of immense reputation. and any information or text given in the book does not need confirmation from any other source. But what has added to the confusion is that the latest edition of Braunwald i. e., 9\"/e has eliminated that diagram from the book and in the text have not clarified which one is better marker. Instead, the text states that Apolipo (a) and B 100 are better marker,. for predicting future cardiovascular events than LDL and HDL. We are not absolutely sure of the answer, but we would for the time being go with LDL. Also Know The following lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are associated with increased coronary risk. - Elevated total cholesterol - Elevated LDL cholesterol Low HDL cholesterol - Increased total to HDL cholesterol ratio - Increased non HDL cholesterol - Hyperiglyceridemia - Increased Lp(a) - Increased apolipoprotein B - Sinai! dense LDL paicles",

        "exp": "DIC is characterized by excessive activation of the coagulation system. That leads to formation of microthrombi throughout the microcirculation of the body, often in a quixotically even distribution. As a consequence of the thrombotic diathesis, there is consumption of platelets, fibrin and coagulation factors and secondary activation of fibrinolytic mechanism. Thus DIC can present with signs and symptoms relating to tissue hypoxia and infarction caused by the myriad microthrombi or as a hemorrhagic disorder related to depletion of elements required for homeostasis, hence the term consumption coagulopathy is used to describe D. I. C. DIC can also lead to hemolytic anemia. It occurs due to fragmentation of red cells as they try to squeeze through the narrowed microvasculature. Schistocytes, the cells characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are quite common in patients with D. I. C (seen in 50%) of the cause. Like D. I. C, T. T. P too is characterized by widespread thrombosis and similar to D. I. C, the disseminated thrombosis leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. But the point to emphasize is that in TT. P the thrombus is a platelet thrombus i. e. the thrombi is composed mainly of platelets aggregates so quite unlike D. I. C. the level of coagulation factors remain normal. Robbins' States \"While D. I. C. and thrombotic microangiopathies share features such as microvascular occlusion and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, they are pathogenetically distinct. In T. T. P and HITS (unlike DIC), activation of the coagulation cascade is not of primary importance, and hence results of laboratory tests of coagulation such as PT and PTT are usually normal. \"",
