Explanation:\"Dilatation of the arterioles results is increased blood flow, which is the cause of heat and redness (erythema) at the site of inflammation\" (Ref: Robbins). Celsus. a Roman writer of the first century ad, first listed the four cardinal signs of inflammation: Rubor (redness). Tumor (swelling). Cal or (heat). Dolor (pain). Vascular changes in Acute inflammation. Changes in vascular flow and caliber begin early after injury. Vasodilation is one of the earliest manifestations of acute inflammation. It first involves the arterioles and then leads to opening of new capillary beds in the area, The result is increased blood flow, which is the cause of heat and redness (erythema), at the site of inflammation. Vasodilation is induced by the action of several mediators, notably histamine and nitric oxide (NO), on vascular smooth muscle. Vasodilation is quickly followed by increased permeability of the microvasculature, with the outpouring of protein-rich fluid into the extra vascular tissues.",

Selectino Selectins function in cell to cell interaction i. e., adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium, o E-selectin (CD-62 E) is present on endothelial cells and it binds to sialyl-lewis, (a sialylated form of oligosaccharide on leukocytes). o Endothelial cell expression of E-selection is a hallmark of acute cytokine mediated inflammation, o P-selectin (CD-62 P) is present on endothelium and platelets and it bind to sialyl-Lewis on leukocytes. o L-selectin (CD-62 L) is present on leukocytes and it binds to mucin like glycoprotein Gly. CAM-1 on endothelium. Immunoglobulin familyo Present on endotheliumo ICAM-1 (intracellular adhesion molecule-1) binds to b2.-integrins (VLA-4) of leukocytes, o Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM or CD-31) is present on both endothelium and leukocytes. It is the major adhesive molecule for diapedisis. Integrinso Integrins promote cell-cell or cell-matrix interaction (in contrast to selectins that promote only cell-cell interaction) i. e., integrins helps in adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium and adhesion of leukocytes to extracellular matrix such as fibronectin. vitronectin, activated compliment, o Present on leukocyteso b1- integrins (VLA-4) bind to VCAM-1 ofendothelium. o b2 - integrins (LFA-1 and MAC-1) bind to ICAM-1 of endothelium.

Maintain blood in fluid state while circulating within the vascular system. 2 Arrest bleeding at the site of injury by formation of hemostatic plug. 3. Ensure the removal of hemostatic plug when healing is complete. o The components of normal hemostasis include: -Blood vessels (endothelium). Platelets. Plasma coagulation factors and their inhibitors. Fibrinolytic system. o When a blood vessel is injured, several steps occur in hemostasis at the site of injury': -Vasoconstrictiono After initial injury, there is a brief period arteriolar vasoconstriction, minimizing vessel diameter and stowing bleeding. o This is due to reflex neurogenic mechanism and augmented by a potent endothelium derived vasoconstrictor endothelin. o However this effect is transient, bleeding would resume if there will no activation of platelet and coagulation system. Primary hemostasiso Endothelial injury exposes highly thrombogenic subendothelial extracellular matrix which allows the platelets to bind (adhere) with collegen of ECM. o Binding of platelets activates these cells and platelets release secretory' granules. o These secretory' products (from secretory granules) recruite additional platelets to form primary hemostatic (platelet plug). Secondary hemostasiso Coagulation system is activated and thrombin is generated, o Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin. o Ultimately these events forms an ireversibly fused mass of platelets, thrombin RBCs and fibrinogen - Definitive secondary hemostatic plug. Repair of v essels and dissolution of cloto The clot attracts and stimulates the growth of fibroblast and smooth musc le cells within the vessel wall, and begins repair process. o At this stage fibrinolytic system is also activated, resulting in dissolution of the clot.",
