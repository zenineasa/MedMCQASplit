Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (AML tl5; 17) (q22; ql2) Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is diagnosed in less than 10% of all AML cases. A variant of APL is knowm as microgranular M3 (or hypogranular) because the granulation is significantly less than in the traditional M3.

WBC count was 20, 000/mm3 and blood film showed >70% mature looking lymphocytes. This clinical situation is suggestive of CLL. Harrison says \"Differential diagnosis of typical B cell CLL is extensive.

May occur in familial clusters with a decreasing age of onset from generation to generation. Lymph node architecture is totally effaced with loss of lymphoid follicles and obliteration of sinuses by an infiltrate of monomorphic small round lymphocytes with condensed chromatin and scant cytoplasmQ. Morphological features that correlate with worse prognosis: Capsular invasion. QIncreased number of large lymphocytes in the node or increased number of (>10%) prolymphocytesQ vs mature looking lymphocytes. Richter Syndrome. Evolution of CLL to large cell lymphoma. QOccurs in <5% of patients. May arise as transformation of the neoplastic small B cell or as unrelated B-cell clone. Immunophenotyping.
