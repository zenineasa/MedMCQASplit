Acellular amyloid deposits derived from calcitonin polypeptides are present in adjacent stroma.Calcitonin is readily demonstrable within the cytoplasm of the tumor cells and in stromal amyloid by immunohistochemical methods.One of the peculiar features of familial medullary cancers is the presence of multicentric C-cell hyperplasia in the surrounding thyroid parenchyma, a feature that is usually absent in sporadic lesions.Foci of C-cell hyperplasia are believed to represent the precursor lesions from which medullary carcinomas arise*Clinical CourseSporadic cases presents with mass in the neck and dysphagia or hoarseness.Paraneoplastic syndrome can occur, caused by the secretion of a peptide hormone (e.g., diarrhea due to the secretion of VIP, or Cushing syndrome due to ACTH).Notably, hypocalcemia is NOT a prominent feature, despite the presence of raised calcitonin levels.Secretion of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) by the neoplastic cells is a useful biomarker.",

Wass Page 91 See APPENDIX-26 below for list of tumor markers Calcitonin (CT) is the main medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) tumor marker. However, it has several limitations, including a concentration-dependent biphasic half-life, sensitivity to rapid in vitro degradation, and the presence of different isoforms/fragments. Procalcitonin (PCT), the prohormone of calcitonin, is free of these limitations but is currently used only as a sepsis marker. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antimicrobial chemotherapy is of paramount importance to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with sepsi Inflammatory markers currently in use, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) do not reliably differentiate between the systemic inflammatory response and sepsis. Procalcitonin (PCT), a precursor of calcitonin, is a 116 amino acid protein that has been proposed as a marker of disease severity in conditions such as septicaemia, meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI) and fungal and parasitic infection. In particular, serial measurements are useful in order to monitor response to therapy. Together with good clinical judgement and judicious use of antimicrobial agents, PCT should serve as a valuable adjunct in the diagnosis and management of sepsis.
