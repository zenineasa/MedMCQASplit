Undifferentiated spindle-cells, profusely inter- spersed with multinucleate giant cell. The tumour stroma is highly vascular. These giant cells were mistaken as osteoclasts in the past, hence the name osteoclastoma.# The tumour is seen commonly in the age group of 20-40 years. A characteristic 'egg-shelf crackling' is often not elicited. The limb may be deformed if a pathological fracture has occurred. Characteristic radiological feature: Soap-bubble appearance",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e. Sheets of atypical plasma cells Age of the patient along with cystic, circumscribed punched out X-ray appearance suggests multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma most often presents as multifocal destructive bone tumours composed of plasma cells throughout the skeletal system. The bone lesions appear radiographically as punched out defects, usually 1-4 cm in diameter and grossly consists of gelatinous soft red tumour masses. Microscopic examination of the marrow reveals an increased number of plasma cells which usually constitute more than 30% of marrow cellularity. The plasma cells can infiltrate the marrow diffusely or be present in sheet like masses that completely replace normal elements. Cytologic ally, the cells may be indistinguishable from normal plasma cells, but they usually show abnormal chromatin such as less clumping of nuclear chromatin, large nucleoli, lack of perinuclear clear zone, lighter blue cytoplasm and varying degrees of anaplasia. The dissociation of nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation is a distinctive feature of myeloma cells.",
