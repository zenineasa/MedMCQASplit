Hyperacute rejection: Immediate (within minutes to hours) graft destruction due to ABO or pre-formed anti-HLA antibodiesQ. Characterised by intravascular thrombosis. QKidney transplants are particularly vulnerableQ to hyperacute graft rejection. Types of Graft Rejection. Hyperacute Rejection. Acute (cellular) Rejection. Chronic Rejection* Immediate (within minutes to hours) graft destruction due to ABO or pre-formed anti- HLA antibodiesQ.* Characterised by intravascular thrombosisQ* Kidney transplants are particularly vulnerableQ to hyperacute graft rejection* Heart and liver transplants are relatively resistantQ.* Occurs during the first 6 monthsQ* Most commonly presents between 5-30Q days after transplantation* T-cell dependent, characterized by mononuclear cell infiltrationQ* Usually reversibleQ* Occurs after the first 6 monthsQ* MC cause of graft failureQ* Non-immune factors may contribute to pathogenesis* Characterized by myointimal proliferation in graft arteries leading to ischemia and fibrosisQ Pathological Features of Rejection Reactions. Acute cellular rejection. Acute humoral rejection. Chronic rejection* Interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration with edema* Mild interstitial hemorrhage* Focal tubular necrosis* Endothelitis* Necrotizing vasculitis with endothelial cell necrosisQ* Neutrophilic infiltration* Deposition of immunoglobulinsQ, complement and fibrin* Renal cortical necrosisQ and atrophy* Dense obliterative intimal fibrosis* Interstitial fibrosis* Glomerular loss with tubular atrophy* Shrinkage of renal parenchyma",

Transfer of individual's own tissue or organ fron one site to another site in the body i. e. recipient is also the donor, eg skin grafting, coronary artery bypass grafting Transfer of tissue between two genetically identical individuals l. e. identical twins.
