P, acute and chronic both are autoimmune disorders in which platelet destruction results from formation of antiplatelet antibodies. Pathogenesiso Chronic I TP is caused by the formation of autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoproteins most often IIb-IIIa or Ib-IX. o In overwhelming majority of cases the antiplatelet antibodies are of the IgG class. o The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar to that seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Opsonized platelets are rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. o The spleen is the major site of the destruction of platelets. Pathologyo The principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic. o The point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in spleen, the spleen size remains normalo On histological examination there is congestion of the sinusoids and hyperactivity and enlargement of the splenic follicles manifested by the formation of prominent germinal centres. Sometimes scattered megakaryocytes are found within the sinuses and sinusoidal walls. This represents a very mild. form of extramedullary hematopoiesis. These splenic findings are not sufficiently distinctive to be considered diagnostic. Bone Marrowo Bone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes. o These findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction. o The importance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure. o A decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I.

Explanation:\"The earliest histologic finding in both the major and the minor salivary glands is periductal and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. \" (Ref: Robbins). Sjogren Syndrome. It is a immune-mediated destruction of the lacrimal and salivary glands characterized by dry eyes {keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and dry mouth (xerostomia). It occurs as an isolated disorder (primary form), also known as the sicca syndrome, or more often in association with another autoimmune disease (secondary form). Associated diseases. Rheumatoid Arthritis (Me)SLEPolymyositis. Systemic sclerosis. Vasculitis. Thyroiditis. The ductal epithelial cells of the exocrine glands are the primary target for autoantibodies. There is also systemic B-eell hyperactivity, as evidenced by the presence of ANAs and RF. Autoantibodies to the RNP antigens SS-A (Ro) and SS-B (La) (also present in SLE). Other secretory glands like nasopharynx, upper airway, and vagina, may also be involved. Involved tissues show an intense lymphocyte (primarily activated CD4+ T ceils) and plasmacell infiltrate. Lacrimal gland destruction results in a lack of tears, leading to drying of the corneal epithelium, with subsequent inflammation, erosion, and ulceration (keratoconjunctivitis). Similar changes may occur in the oral mucosa as a result of loss of salivary gland output, giving rise to mucosal atrophy, with inflammatory Assuring and ulceration (xerostomia). Dryness and crusting of the nose may lead to ulcerations and even perforation of the nasal septum. When the respiratory passages are involved, secondary laryngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonitis may appear. Approximately 25% of the patients (especially those with anti-SS-A antibodies) develop extraglandular disease affecting the CNS, skin, kidneys, and muscles. Renal lesions take the form of mild interstitial nephritis associated with tubular transport defects: Unlike in SLE. glomerulonephritis is rare. 90%% cases occur in women between 35 and 45 years. Extraglandular manifestations include synovitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and peripheral neuropathy. There is a 40-fold increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.",
