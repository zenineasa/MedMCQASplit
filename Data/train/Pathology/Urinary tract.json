If the entire specimen has only one pattern present, then both the primary and secondary grades are repoed as the same grade. g. As Gleason grades range from 1 to 5, Gleason score thus ranges from 2 to 10. h. i. The Gleason score is used to help evaluate the prognosis of men with prostate cancer. Together with other parameters, the Gleason score is incorporated into a strategy of prostate cancer staging which predicts & prognosis and helps guide therapy. j. A point of impoance is that the primary Gleason grade is most impoant with respect to placing patients in prognostic groups.

Others believe them to be distinct clinicopathologic entities from the outset. In any case, injury to the podocytes is thought to represent the initiating event of primary FSGS. As with minimal change disease, permeability-increasing factors produced by lymphocytes have been proposed. The deposition of hyaline masses in the glomeruli represents the entrapment of plasma proteins and lipids in foci of injury where sclerosis develops. IgM and complement proteins commonly seen in the lesion are also believed to result from nonspecific entrapment in damaged glomeruli.

This occurs as a consequence of chronic hypertension resulting in narrowing of preglomerular aeries and aerioles, with a consequent reduction in glomerular blood flow. Alternatively, glomerulosclerosis occurs because of glomerular hypertension and glomerular hyperfiltration. According to this theory, hypertension causes some glomeruli to become sclerotic. As an attempt to compensate for the loss of renal function, the remaining nephrons undergo vasodilation of the preglomerular aerioles and experience an increase in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration.

The haematuria is generally slight giving the urine smoky appearance and erythrocytes are detectable by microscopy or by chemical testing for hemoglobin. Appearance of red cell casts is another classical feature of acute nephritic syndrome. 2. The proteinuria is mild (less than 3 gm per 24 hrs) and is usually non-selective (nephritic range proteinuria). 3. Hypertension is variable depending upon the severity of the glomerular disease but is generally mild. 4. Oedema in nephritic syndrome is usually mild and results from sodium and water retention. 5. Oliguria is variable and reflects the severity of glomerular involvement.

The hypercellu- larity is produced both by proliferation of cells in the mesangium and so-called endocapillary proliferation involving capillary endothelium and infiltrating leukocytes. The glomeruli have an accentuated \"lobular\" appearance due to the proliferating mesangial cells and increased mesangial matrix (Fig. 20-16). The GBM is thickened, and often shows a \"double- contour\" or \"tram-track\" appearance, especially evident in silver or PAS stains. This is caused by \"duplication\" of the basement membrane (also commonly referred to as splitting), usually as the result of new basement membrane synthesis in response to subendothelial deposits of immune complexes. Between the duplicated basement membranes there is inclu- sion or interposition of cellular elements, which can be of mesangial, endothelial, or leukocytic origin. Such interposition also gives rise to the appearance of \"split\" basement mem- branes",

The clear cytoplasm of tumour cells is due to the removal of glycogen and lipid from the cytoplasm during the processing of tissues. The tumour cells have a variety of patterns: solid, trabecular and tubular, separated by delicate vasculature. Majority of clear cell tumours are well differentiated. 2. Papillary type RCC (15%): The tumour cells are arranged in a papillary pattern over the fibrovascular stalks. Psammoma bodies may be seen. The genetic abnormality in these cases lies in MET gene located on chromosome 7 3. Granular cell type RCC (8%): The tumour cells have abundant acidophilic cytoplasm. These tumours have more marked nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromatism, and cellular atypia. 4. Chromophobe type RCC (5%): This type shows an admixture of pale clear cells with perinuclear halo and acidophilic granular cells. The cytoplasm of these tumour cells contains many vesicles. These cases have genetic defects in the form of multiple losses of whole chromosomes i. e. they have extreme degree of hypodiploidy 5. Sarcomatoid type RCC (1. 5%): This is the most anaplastic and poorly differentiated form. The tumour is characterized by whorls of atypical spindle tumour cells. 6. Collecting duct type RCC (0. 5%): This is a rare type that occurs in the medulla. It is composed of a single layer of cuboidal tumour cells arranged in a tubular and papillary pattern.

Sectioning reveals a thin wall lined by an opaque, gray-white, wrinkled epidermis, frequently with protruding hair shafts. Within the wall, it is common to find grossly evident tooth structures and areas of calcification. Microscopically, the cyst wall is composed of stratified squa- mous epithelium with underlying sebaceous glands, hair shafts, and other skin adnexal structures (Fig. 22-39). In most cases tissues from other germ layers can be identified, such as cailage, bone, thyroid, and neural tissue. Dermoid cysts are sometimes incorporated within the wall of a mucinous cystad- enoma. About 1% of the dermoids undergo malignant transformation, most commonly to squamous cell carci- noma, but also to other cancers as well (e. g., thyroid carcinoma, melanoma)",

A renal biopsy specimen showed lobular glomerulopathy and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis-like lesions on light microscopy. There was scanty staining for immunoglobulins and complement. Electron microscopy revealed granular deposits with fibril formation. Immunohistochemistry of the fibronectin showed intense staining in the mesangium and peripheral loop. Therefore, this case was diagnosed as fibronectin glomerulopathy. The kidney function was rapidly decreasing, necessitating haemodialysis 2 months after renal biopsy. It is impoant to consider fibronectin glomerulopathy in the differential diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in older people.",

Any increased permeability resulting from either structural or physicochemical alterations in the GBM allows proteins to escape from the plasma into the glomerular filtrate. With long-standing or extremely heavy proteinuria, serum albumin is decreased, resulting in hypoalbuminemia and adrop in plasma colloid osmotic pressure. Which results in a decrease of intravascular volume and renal blood flow triggers increased release of renin from renal juxtaglomerular cells. Renin, in turn, stimulates the angiotensin-aldosterone axis, which promotes the retention of salt and water by the kidney. This tendency is exacerbated by reductions in the cardiac secretion of natriuretic factors. In the face of continuing proteinuria, thesealterations fuher aggravate the edema.

Thrombosis: In the hepatic, poal or cerebral veins Laboratory Findings PNH: Ham's acidified serum test and sucrose hemolysis test positive.

The GBM is thickened, and often shows a \"double- contour\" or \"tram-track\" appearance, especially evident in silver or PAS stains. This is caused by \"duplication\" of the basement membrane (also commonly referred to as splitting), usually as the result of new basement membrane synthesis in response to subendothelial deposits of immune complexes. Between the duplicated basement membranes there is inclu- sion or interposition of cellular elements, which can be of mesangial, endothelial, or leukocytic origin.

This view is largely based on immunofluorescence studies of GN in humans which have revealed glomerular deposits of immunoglobulins and complement in patterns that closely resemble those of experimental models. The consequences of injury at different sites within the glomerulus in various glomerular diseases can be assessed when compared with the normal physiologic role of the main cells involved i. e. endothelial, mesangial, visceral epithelial, and parietal epithelial cells as well as of the GBM as summed up in Table 22. 8.<\\p> text book of pathology harshmohan 6th edition page 662",
