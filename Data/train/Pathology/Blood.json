        "exp": "Answer: (C) Thalassemia minor anemia may present with normal RBC diameter (265-68-Hrshmohon 7th) (630= Rabbins- basis disease)Red blood cell distribution width (RDW or RCDW) is a measure of the variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume that is reported as part of a standard complete blood count. Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8 pm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range in human red blood cells is 11.5-14.5%. If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause. Deficiencies of Vitamin Bl2 orfolate produce a macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) in which the RDW is elevated in roughly two- thirds of all cases; however, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of a mixed iron and B!2 deficiency, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as anisocytosis. An elevation in the RDW is not characteristic of all anemias; anemia of chronic disease,hereditary spherocytosis, acute blood loss, aplastic anemia (anemia resulting from an inability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells), and certain hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including some cases of thalassemia minor) all may present with a normal RDW* The human erythrocyte is a biconcave disc, 7-2 pm in diameter, and has a thickness of 2-4 pm at the periphery and 1 mm in the centre* More than 90% of the weight of erythrocytes consists of haemoglobin.

Reduced glutathione is generated from oxidized glutathione and the reducing equivalent for this reaction is provided by NADPH. This NADPH is generated in HMP shunt by enzyme Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, while oxidizing glucose-6-phosphate.* If G6PD is deficient, NADPH production will be reduced that results in increased susceptibility of RBC to oxidative damage because of unavailability of reduced glutathione. So, whenever there is oxidant stress, e.g. by drugs, infection or foods, hemolysis occurs. G6PD deficiency causes episodic intravascular and extravascular hemolysis.",

The diagnostic test for AIHA is the antiglobulin test (Coombs' test).Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA):Onset is very often abrupt and can be dramatic.The hemoglobin level can drop, within days, to as low as 4g/dL; the massive red cell removal will produce jaundice, and often the spleen will be enlarged. When this triad is present, the suspicion of AIHA must be high.The diagnostic test for AIHA is the antiglobulin test (Coombs' test).AIHA is diagnosed by detection of autoantibodies with the direct antiglobulin (direct Coombs') test.IgG is present in warm antibody hemolytic anemia, and C3 (C3b and C3d) in cold antibody disease.Reticulocyte count is increased in both hereditary spherocytosis and AIHA.Osmotic Fragility Test is used to evaluate hemolytic anemia, especially hereditary spherocytosis, and immune hemolytic states.Test for PNH:PNH will present with hemoglobinuria.Blood tests in PNH show changes consistent with intravascular hemolytic anemia:Low hemoglobinRaised LDHRaised reticulocytes (immature red cells released by the bone marrow to replace the destroyed cells)Raised bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin)Decreased levels of haptoglobinThe direct antiglobulin test (DAT, or direct Coombs' test) is negative, as antibodies do not cause the hemolysis in PNH.Warm antibody hemolytic anemiaCold antibody hemolytic anemia* Antibodies here bind with antigens (on RBC) at body temperature (37deg C)* These antibodies are called warm antibodies and are nearly IgGQ* Antibodies here bind with antigens (on RBC) better at temperature lower than 37degC* These antibodies are called reactive antibodies and are usually IgM* Rarely IgG antibodies e.g. The Donath Landsteiner antibody of Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria)QCausesCauses1.

Other common physical examination findings include arthropathy (13 to 68%), hepatomegaly- hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis (54 to 93%), splenomegaly (10 to 55%), irregular heartbeat, congestive heart failure, telangiectases, and loss of midline body hair or testicular atrophy.The morphologic changes in hereditary hemochromatosis are characterized principally by:Deposition of hemosiderin in the following organs (in decreasing order of severity): liver, pancreas, myocardium, pituitary gland, adrenal gland, thyroid and parathyroid glands, joints, and skin (detected by the Prussian blue histologic reaction or by atomic absorption analysis of tissue)Liver cirrhosis (micronodular)Pancreatic fibrosisOption (B) & (C); Penetrance in genetics is the proportion of individuals carrying a particular variant of a gene (allele or genotype) that also expresses an associated trait (phenotype). A condition, most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, is said to show complete penetrance. Only Hemochromatosis Type 4 & 5 are autosomal dominant, both of which are rare.

Overt iron-overload organ injury and illness occur more frequently in men than in women who have this disorder. Women are protected somewhat by the menstrual loss of 15 to 25 mg of iron each month, and by the transfer of approximately 750 mg of iron to the fetus during pregnancy. Menstrual blood losses and pregnancy do not explain all of the differences in body iron stores between male and female homozygotes. It is possible that an additional factor(s) prevents most women with hemochromatosis from absorbing and accumulating as much iron as affected men.",

Nutrient deficiencies reduce marrow production, so reticulocytosis is unlikely. DIC is unlikely with a normal platelet count.

In hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of intestinal absorption of dietary iron is lost, leading to net iron accumulation of 0.5 to 1.0 gm year.o It may be recalled that the total body iron pool ranges from 2-6 gm in normal adults; about 0.5 gm is stored in the liver 98% of which is hepatocytes. In hemochromatosis the iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one third of which accumulates in the liver.o The iron accumulation is life long, the rate of net iron accumulation is 0.5 to 1.0 gm/year. The disease manifests itself typically after 20 gm of storage iron have accumulated.

Myeloma, which is typically accompanied by a monoclonal gammopathy, most often does not cause liver and spleen enlargement, and morphologically, the cells resemble plasma cells. Light chains in urine (Bence Jones proteins) also are a feature of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia occurs with myeloma because myeloma cells produce MIP1-a that up-regulates RANKL production and increased osteoclastic activity, so punched-out lytic bone lesions are typical of multiple myeloma. A t (14;18) translocation is characteristic of a follicular lymphoma. There is typically no leukemic phase to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.",

Because FXI has a half-life of 40-70 h, the replacement therapy can be given on alternate days. The use of antifibrinolytic drugs is beneficial to control bleeds, with the exception of hematuria or bleeds in the bladder.# Rx of Hemophilia A:- Factor replacement therapy for hemophilia can be provided either in response to a bleeding episode or as a prophylactic treatment.- Cryoprecipitate is enriched with FVIII protein (each bag contains ~80 IU of FVIII) and was commonly used for the treatment of hemophilia; but because of the risk of bloodborne diseases, it should be avoided in hemophilia patients when factor concentrates are available.# The FVIII half-life of 8-12 h requires injections twice a day to maintain therapeutic levels,# Whereas the FIX half-life is longer, ~24 h, so that once-a-day injection is sufficient.",

These include:ReticulocytosisMarrow erythroid hyperplasiaHemosiderosisMild jaundice.Cholelithiasis (pigment stones - 40% to 50% cases)Moderate splenic enlargementsSplenomegaly results from congestion of the cords of Billroth and increased numbers of phagocytes needed to clear the spherocytes.Clinical FeaturesThe diagnosis is based on family history, hematologic findings, and laboratory evidence.In two thirds of the patients the red cells are abnormally sensitive to osmotic lysis when incubated in hypotonic salt solutions, which causes the influx of water into spherocytes with little margin for expansion.HS red cells also have an increased mean cell hemoglobin concentration, due to dehydration caused by the loss of K+ and H2O.The characteristic clinical features are anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice.The generally stable clinical course is sometimes punctuated by aplastic crises, usually triggered by an acute parvovirus infection.Parvovirus infects and kills red cell progenitors, causing red cell production to cease until an effective immune response commences, generally in 1 to 2 weeks.Because of the reduced life span of HS red cells, cessation of erythropoiesis for even short time periods leads to sudden worsening of the anemia.Transfusions may be necessary to support the patient until the immune response clears the infection.Hemolytic crises are produced by intercurrent events leading to increased splenic destruction of red cells (e.g., infectious mononucleosis); these are clinically less significant than aplastic crises.Gallstones, found in many patients, can also produce symptoms.Splenectomy treats the anemia and its complications, but brings with it the risk of sepsis.

Serum erythropoietin levels are low for the level of Hb and hepcidin levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "The increased ferritin concentration and reduced total iron-binding capacity are typical of anemia of chronic diseases, such as an autoimmune disease. Increased levels of cytokines such as interleukin-6 lead to increased hepatic production of hepcidin that stops ferroportin from releasing storage iron, promoting sequestration of storage iron, with poor use for erythropoiesis. The secretion of erythropoietin by the kidney is impaired. Various underlying diseases, including cancer, collagen vascular diseases, and chronic infections, can produce this pattern of anemia. An iron deficiency would produce microcytic anemia, with a low serum ferritin level and reduced hepcidin production. Aplastic anemia is unlikely because the platelet count and WBC count are normal. Megaloblastic anemias are macrocytic without an increase in iron stores. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias are caused by serious acute conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation; these patients have thrombocytopenia caused by widespread thrombosis.

The rapid expansion of the marrow caused by proliferation of blasts can lead to bone pain and tenderness.

Anemia and thrombocytopenia result from suppression of normal hematopoiesis by the leukemic clone in the marrow. The phenotype of CD19+, CD3-, and sIg- is typical of pre-B cells.

This is the basis for measuring the ESR.ESR is simple test for systemic inflammatory response caused by any stimulus.The ESR is a simple non-specific screening test that indirectly measures the presence of inflammation in the body.It reflects the tendency of red blood cells to settle more rapidly in the face of some disease states, usually because of increases in plasma fibrinogen, immunoglobulins, and other acute-phase reaction proteins.Changes in red cell shape or numbers may also affect the ESR.Note that the ESR denotes merely the presence of tissue damage or disease, but not its severityIt may be used to follow the progress of the diseased state, or monitor the effectiveness of treatment.ESRIncreasedDecreased* PregnancyQ* InflammationQ* AnemiaQ* Rheumatoid arthritisQ* CancerQ* Kidney disorders* PolycythemiaQ* Sickle cell anemiaQ* Hereditary spherocytosisQ* Congestive heart failureQ",

On physical examination, there is an enlarged, nontender, supraclavicular lymph node and enlargement of the Waldeyer ring of oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue. There is no hepato- splenomegaly. CBC is normal except for findings of mild anemia. A lymph node biopsy specimen shows replacement by a monomorphous population of lymphoid cells that are twice the size of normal lymphocytes, with enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry of the node indicates that most lymphoid cells are CD19+, CD10+, CD3-, CD15-, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase negative (TdT-).

TdT can be expressed in B lineage cells at an earlier stage of maturation. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a T-cell neoplasm that occurs typically in the mediastinum of children. In chronic lymphadenitis, the lymph node has many cell types-macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. A monomorphous infiltrate is typical of non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

These abnormalities are almost invariably inherited mutations, and thus diseases of the membrane-cytoskeleton complex belong to the category of inherited hemolytic anemias. Before the red cells lyse, they often exhibit changes that alter the normal biconcave disc shape.

Pg. 660:\" Hemolysis in PNH is due to an intrinsic abnormality of the red cell which makes it exquisitely sensitive to activatedComlement, whether it is activated through the alternative pathway or through an antigen-antibody reaction.The former mechanism is mainly responsible for IV hemolysis in PNH . \"Discussion:Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)Introduction:# PNH is an acquired chronic Hemolytic Aanemia characterized by persistent intravascular hemolysis subject to recurrent exacerbations, and TRIAD: hemolysis + pancytopenia + risk of venous thrombosis.# There is no evidence of inherited susceptibility. PNH has never been reported as a congenital disease, but it can present in small children or in people in their seventies, although most patients are young adults.Pathophysiology:# Shortage of a unique glycolipid molecule, GPI, which, through a peptide bond, anchors these proteins to the surface membrane of cells. The shortage of GPI is due in turn to a mutation in an X-linked gene, called PIG-A, required for an early step in GPI biosynthesis. In virtually each patient, the PIG-A mutation is different.# An element of bone marrow failure (BMF) in PNH is the rule rather than the exception.C/f:# PNH has about the same frequency in men and women.# TRIAD of hemolysis, pancytopenia, and venous thrombosis makes PNH a truly unique clinical condition;2# Without Rx, the median survival is -8-10 years; in the past the commonest cause of death has been venous thrombosis followed by infection secondary to severe neutropenia and hemorrhage secondary to severe thrombocytopenia.2# PNH may evolve into aplastic anemia (AA), and PNH may manifest in patients who previously had AA.# Rarely (estimated 1-2% of all cases), PNH may terminate in acute myeloid leukemia.# On the other hand, full spontaneous recovery from PNH has been well documented, albeit rarely.LAB Diagnosis:# The most consistent blood finding is anemia, which may range from mild to moderate to very severe.# The anemia is usually normo-macrocytic, with unremarkable red cell morphology; if the MCV is high, it is largely accounted for by reticulocytosis, which may be quite marked (up to 20%, or up to 400,000/iL).# Neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia may or may not be present from the outset or develop subsequently.# Following findings make the diagnosis of Hemolytic Aanemia compelling:Q- Unconjugated bilirubin is mildly or moderately elevated,0- LDH is typically markedly elevated (values in the thousands are common), and- Haptoglobin is usually undetectable.# The definitive diagnosis of PNH must be based on the demonstration that a substantial proportion of the patient's red cells have an increased susceptibility to complement (C), due to the deficiency on their surface of proteins (particularly CD59 and CD55) that normally protect the red cells from activated C.# The sucrose hemolysis test is unreliable, and the acidified serum (Ham) test is carried out in few labs.# The gold standard today is flow cytometry, which is carried out on granulocytes or on red cells.- A bimodal distribution of cells, with a population that is CD59- CD55-, is diagnostic of PNH.Diseases/ Clinical Situations with Predominantly Intravascular Hemolysis:DiseaseOnset/ Time CourseMain MechanismAppropriate Diagnostic ProcedureCommentsMismatched blood transfusionAbruptNearly always ABO incompatibilityRepeat cross match-Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)Chronic with acute exacerbationsComplement (C)- mediated destruction of CD59(-) red cellsFlow cytometry to display a CD59(-) red cell populationExacerbations due to C activation through any pathwayParoxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH)AcuteImmune lysis of normal red cellsTest for Donath- Landsteiner antibodyOften triggered by viral infectionSepticemiaVery acuteExotoxins produced by Clostridium perfringensBlood culturesOther organisms may be responsibleMicroangiopathicAcute or chronicRed cell fragmentationRed cell morphology on blood smearDifferent causes ranging from endothelial damage to hemangioma to leaky prosthetic heart valveMarch hemoglobinuriaAbruptMechanical destructionTargeted history taking-FavismAcuteDestruction of older fraction of G6PD-deficient red cellsG6PD assayTriggered by ingestion of large dish of fava beans; but trigger can be infection or drug insteadRx:# Unlike other acquired HAs, PNH may be lifelong and most patients receive supportive Rx only, including transfusion of filtered red cells2 whenever necessary.# Long-term glucocorticoids are not indicated because there is no evidence that they have any effect on chronic hemolysis, and their side effects are considerable and potentially dangerous.# The onh form of Rx that can provide a cure for PNH is allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT); when an HLA-identical sibling is available, BMT should be offered to any young patient with severe PNH.# A major advance in the management of PNH has been the development of a humanized monoclonal antibody, Eculizumab (intravenously at q2wk intervals), directed against the complement protein C5.",

It is generally associated with low cost diet and bleeding.Recent advances in iron metabolism led to the recognition of new entities of iron deficiency anemia in non bleeding and \"high cost diet\" nourished individuals. These are known as genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia.Apparently rare these genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia should be recognized by hematologists as they are refractory to classical oral or intravenous iron administration.These includesMutations in gene encoding DMT1Mutations in gene encoding glutaredoxin 5.Hypotransferrinemia or AtransferrinemiaDeficiency of ceruloplasminIRIDA (Iron Recractory, Iron Deficiency Anemia)Genetic forms of Iron deficiency anemia DMT1 MutationAtransferrinemiaGlutaredoxin 5AceruloplasminemiaAge at diagnosisAt birthLate onsetMidlifeLate onsetAnemiaMicrocytic hypochromicMicrocytic hypochromicMicrocytic hypochromicMicrocytic hypochromicSerum ironHighLowHighLowTransferrin saturationHighHigh or non measurableHighLowSerum ferritinLow or normal ferritinHighHighHighRinged sideroblastsNoNoYesNoLiver iron overloadYesYesYesYesBrain damageNoNoNoYesHepcidin levelsLowNot yet measuredNot yet measuredNot yet measuredComing back to the questionThe serum iron indices of the patient match those of Atransferrinemia i.e., low serum iron increased serum ferritin, increased transferring saturation.DMT1 can be ruled out as it has low ferritin level and high iron level.AtransferrinemiaTransferrin is an iron carrying protein that transmits iron to the erythroblasts.Atransferrinemia or hypotransferrinemia results in reduced delivery of iron to erythroblasts and development of iron deficient anemia.This leads to massive but futile iron absorption.The increased iron that is absorbed is not carried to the erythroid cell, instead, it is deposited elsewhere outside of erythroblasts.Iron is deposited in the visceral organs rather than in the bone marrow.DMT1 mutationDMT1 is a transmembrane protein involved in dietary nonheme iron uptake at the brush border of duodenal enterocytes and also plays crucial role in iron utilization at the endo somal membrane of the erythroid precursors.In DMT1 mutation the iron absorption in the duodenum continues because the absorption of heme iron is not affected.The mutation primarily affects iron utilization and not absorption. Iron utilization in erythroid precursors is disturbed leading to severe iron deficiency anemia.",

It could be a nutritional deficiency in children and pregnant women, but more likely is due to chronic blood loss in adults. The ferritin concentration is a measure of storage iron because it is derived from the total body storage pool in the liver, spleen, and marrow. About 80% of functional body iron is contained in hemoglobin; the remainder is in muscle myoglobin. Individuals with severe liver disease can have an elevated serum ferritin level because of its release from liver stores. A bone marrow biopsy specimen provides a good indication of iron stores because the iron stain of the marrow shows hemosiderin in macrophages, but such a biopsy is an expensive procedure. Some patients with hemoglobinopathies, such as b-thalassemia, also can have microcytic anemia, but this is far less common than iron deficiency. The serum haptoglobin level is decreased with intravascular hemolysis, but the anemia is normocytic because the iron can be recycled. The serum iron concentration or transferrin level by itself gives no indication of iron stores because, in anemia of chronic disease, the patient's iron level can be normal to low, and the transferrin levels also can be normal to low, but iron stores are increased. Transferrin, a serum transport protein for iron, usually has about 33% iron saturation.",

Underlying chronic inflammatory or neoplastic diseases increases the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-g. These cytokines promote the sequestration of iron in storage compartments and depress erythropoietin production. Autoantibody hemolytic anemias occur in several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but not usually in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as in this case. Normal serum haptoglobin rules out intravascular hemolysis; iron is recycled at a rapid rate. Impaired synthesis of b-globin chains gives rise to b-thalassemia, also characterized by hemolysis. Complement lysis is enhanced in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which results from mutations in the PIGA gene. Patients with this disorder have a history of infections. Sequestration of RBCs in the spleen occur when RBC membranes are abnormal, as in hereditary spherocytosis or sickle cell anemia, or RBCs are coated by antibodies, as in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Metastases are space-occupying lesions (myelophthisic process) that can lead to leukoerythroblastosis, with nucleated RBCs and immature WBCs appearing on the peripheral blood smear.",

Most have surface Ig.oSpecial Subtypes: Immunodeficiency-associated large B-cell lymphoma, Primary effusion lymphomaoClinical Features:-DLBCL typically presents as a rapidly enlarging mass at a nodal or extranodal site.-It can arise virtually anywhere in the body.-Waldeyer ring, the oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue that includes the tonsils and adenoids, is involved commonly.-Primary or secondary involvement of the liver and spleen may take the form of large destructive masses.-Extranodal sites include the gastrointestinal tract, skin, bone, brain, and other tissues.-Bone marrow involvement is relatively uncommon and usually occurs late in the course.-Rarely, a leukemic picture emerges.Other Options[?]Hairy cell Leukemia:-This rare but distinctive B-cell neoplasm constitutes about 2% of all leukemias.-Hairy cell leukemias are associated in more than 90% of cases with activating point mutations in the serine/threonine kinase BRAF, which is positioned immediately downstream of RAS in the MAPK signaling cdscade[?]Burkitt's lymphoma:-Within the category of Burkitt Lymphoma fall (1) African (endemic) Burkitt lymphoma, (2) sporadic (non-endemic) Burkitt lymphoma, and (3) a subset of aggressive lymphomas occurring in individuals infected with HIV.-Burkitt lymphomas occurring in each of these settings are histologically identical but differ in some clinical, genotypic, and virologic characteristics.-All forms of Burkitt lymphoma are highly associated with translocations of the MYC gene on chromosome 8 that lead to increased MYC protein levels.-Essentially all endemic Burkitt lymphomas are latently infected with EBV, which is also present in about 25% of HIV-associated tumors and 15% to 20% of sporadic cases.-Characteristic \"starry sky\" pattern.-When the bone marrow is involved, aspirates reveal tumor cells with slightly clumped nuclear chromatin, two to five distinct nucleoli, and royal blue cytoplasm containing clear cytoplasmic vacuoles.[?]Mantle Cell lymphoma:-Mantle cell lymphoma is an uncommon lymphoid neoplasm that makes up about 2.5% of NHL in the United States and 7% to 9% of NHL in Europe.-It usually presents in the fifth to sixth decades of life and shows a male predominance.-As the name implies, the tumor cells closely resemble the normal mantle zone B cells that surround germinal centers.-Virtually all mantle cell lymphomas have an (11;14) translocation involving the IgH locus on chromosome 14 and the cyclin D1 locus on chromosome 11 that leads to over expression of cyclin D1.-Most common presentation is painless lymphadenopathy.-Symptoms related to involvement of the spleen (present in -50% of cases) and gut are also common.",
