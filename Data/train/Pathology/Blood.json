        "exp": "Answer: (C) Thalassemia minor anemia may present with normal RBC diameter (265-68-Hrshmohon 7th) (630= Rabbins- basis disease). Red blood cell distribution width (RDW or RCDW) is a measure of the variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume that is reported as part of a standard complete blood count. Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8 pm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range in human red blood cells is 11. 5-14. 5%. If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause. Deficiencies of Vitamin Bl2 orfolate produce a macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) in which the RDW is elevated in roughly two- thirds of all cases; however, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of a mixed iron and B! 2 deficiency, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as anisocytosis. An elevation in the RDW is not characteristic of all anemias; anemia of chronic disease, hereditary spherocytosis, acute blood loss, aplastic anemia (anemia resulting from an inability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells), and certain hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including some cases of thalassemia minor) all may present with a normal RDW* The human erythrocyte is a biconcave disc, 7-2 pm in diameter, and has a thickness of 2-4 pm at the periphery and 1 mm in the centre* More than 90% of the weight of erythrocytes consists of hemoglobin.

Extrinsic pathway* Mainly in vitro pathway of coagulation but it may be activated in vivo also.* This pathway may involve contact activation with interactions of the so- called contact factors: factor XII (Hageman factor), prekallikrein, and high- molecular weight kininogen, as well as factor XI.* In vivo activation occurs due to contact activation of factor XII from subendothelial collagen and other components like platelets following endothelial injury.* It is probably initiated by the tissue factor-factor Vila complex (from the extrinsic pathway), activating factor IX to factor IXa. Factor IXa, in turn, leads to the conversion of factor X to factor Xa, catalyzed by factor Villa.* It is mainly in vivo pathway but it may be activated in vitro also.* In vivo it is initiated by tissue factor, which activates factor VII and forms a Vila tissue factor complex.* The Vila tissue factor complex initiates coagulation through the activation of factor X to factor Xa (and additionally factor IX to factor IXa).* Factor Xa converts prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor lla).* In the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin factor-Va acts as a cofactor.* In vitro activation occurs due to exposure of blood to tissue derived thromboplastin reagents (tissue factor).

At present the most widely used protocol for the storage of red blood cells (packed RBCs. washed, leukodepleted, irradiated, apheresis, deglycocerolized, rejuvinated) (for up to 42 days) is the collection of blood into anticoagulant solutions (typically citrate-dextrose-phosphate); red cell concentrates are prepared by the removal of plasma and, in some cases, also leukoreduction.

Hemochromatosiso Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as liver and pancreas. o The total body content of the iron is tightly regulated, as the daily losses are matched by gastrointestinal absorption. In hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of intestinal absorption of dietary iron is lost, leading to net iron accumulation of 0. 5 to 1. 0 gm year. o It may be recalled that the total body iron pool ranges from 2-6 gm in normal adults; about 0. 5 gm is stored in the liver 98% of which is hepatocytes. In hemochromatosis the iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one third of which accumulates in the liver. o The iron accumulation is life long, the rate of net iron accumulation is 0. 5 to 1. 0 gm/year. The disease manifests itself typically after 20 gm of storage iron have accumulated. The disease first mainfests itself in the fifth to sixth decades of life. o Excessive iron is directly toxic to host tissueso The clinical features of hemochromatosis are characterized principally by deposition of excess iron in the following organs in decreasing order of severity.

DDAVP is a synthetic vasopressin analogue that causes a transient rise in FVIII and v. WF, but not F-IX. The treatment of FXI deficiency is based on the infusion of FFP at doses of 15-20 mL/kg to maintain trough levels ranging from 10 to 20%. Because FXI has a half-life of 40-70 h, the replacement therapy can be given on alternate days. The use of antifibrinolytic drugs is beneficial to control bleeds, with the exception of hematuria or bleeds in the bladder.# Rx of Hemophilia A:- Factor replacement therapy for hemophilia can be provided either in response to a bleeding episode or as a prophylactic treatment.- Cryoprecipitate is enriched with FVIII protein (each bag contains ~80 IU of FVIII) and was commonly used for the treatment of hemophilia; but because of the risk of bloodborne diseases, it should be avoided in hemophilia patients when factor concentrates are available.# The FVIII half-life of 8-12 h requires injections twice a day to maintain therapeutic levels, # Whereas the FIX half-life is longer, ~24 h, so that once-a-day injection is sufficient.",

        "exp": "Ans: A (Hereditary Spherocytosis) Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition. Explanation:\"In two thirds of the patients with Hereditary Spherocytosis, the red cells are abnormally sensitive to osmotic lysis when incubated in hypotonic salt solutions. which causes the influx of water into spherocytes with little margin for expansion \"Ref: Robbins. Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS). This inherited disorder is caused by intrinsic defects in the red cell membrane skeleton. Red blood cells are spheroid, less deformable, and vulnerable to splenic sequestration and destruction. Majority of cases are autosomal dominant (75%). Pathogenesis. The remarkable elasticity and durability of the normal red cell are attributable to the physicochemical properties of its specialized membrane skeleton which lies closely apposed to the internal surface of the plasma membrane. Its chief protein component, spectrin, consists of two polypeptide chains, a and b. which form intertwined (helical) flexible heterodimers. The \"head\" regions of spectrin dimers selfassociate to form tetramers, while the \"tails\" associate with actin oligomers. Each actin oligomer can bind multiple spectrin tetramers. thus creating a two-dimensional speetrin-aetin skeleton that is connected to the ceil membrane by two distinct interactions. The first, involving the proteins ankyrin and band 4. 2. binds spectrin to the transmembrane ion transporter, band 3. The second, involving protein 4. 1. binds the \"tail\" of spectrin to another transmembrane protein, glycophorin A, HS is caused by diverse mutations that lead to an insufficiency of membrane skeletal components. The life span of the affected red cells is decreased on average to 10 to 20 days (Normal -120 days). The pathogenic mutations most commonly affect ankyrin. band 3. spectrin, or band 4. 2. Young HS red cells are normal in shape, but the deficiency of membrane skeleton reduces the stability of the lipid hiiayer, leading to the loss of membrane fragments as red cells age in the circulation. The loss of membrane relative to cytoplasm \"forces\" the cells to assume the smallest possible diameter for a given volume, namely, a sphere. The invariably beneficial effects of splenectomy prove that the spleen has a cardinal role in the premature demise of spherocytes. Normal red cells must undergo extreme deformation to leave the cords of Billroth and enter the sinusoids. Because of their spheroidal shape and reduced deformability, the hapless spherocytes are trapped in the splenic cords, where they provide a happy meal for phagocytes. After splenectomy the spherocytes persist, but the anemia is corrected. Morphology. The most specific morphologic finding is spherocytosis, apparent on smears as abnormally small, dark-staining (hyperchromic) red cells lacking the central zone of pallor. Spherocytosis is distinctive but not pathognomonic, since other forms of membrane loss, such as in autoimmune hemolytic anemias, also cause the formation of spherocytes. Other features are common to all hemolytic anemias. These include: Reticulocytosis. Marrow erythroid hyperplasia. Hemosiderosis. Mild jaundice. Cholelithiasis (pigment stones - 40% to 50% cases). Moderate splenic enlargements. Splenomegaly results from congestion of the cords of Billroth and increased numbers of phagocytes needed to clear the spherocytes. Clinical Features. The diagnosis is based on family history, hematologic findings, and laboratory evidence. In two thirds of the patients the red cells are abnormally sensitive to osmotic lysis when incubated in hypotonic salt solutions, which causes the influx of water into spherocytes with little margin for expansion. HS red cells also have an increased mean cell hemoglobin concentration, due to dehydration caused by the loss of K+ and H2O. The characteristic clinical features are anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice. The generally stable clinical course is sometimes punctuated by aplastic crises, usually triggered by an acute parvovirus infection. Parvovirus infects and kills red cell progenitors, causing red cell production to cease until an effective immune response commences, generally in 1 to 2 weeks. Because of the reduced life span of HS red cells, cessation of erythropoiesis for even short time periods leads to sudden worsening of the anemia. Transfusions may be necessary to support the patient until the immune response clears the infection. Hemolytic crises are produced by intercurrent events leading to increased splenic destruction of red cells (e. g., infectious mononucleosis); these are clinically less significant than aplastic crises. Gallstones, found in many patients, can also produce symptoms. Splenectomy treats the anemia and its complications, but brings with it the risk of sepsis. (See the following Figure)",

Serum erythropoietin levels are low for the level of Hb and hepcidin levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "The increased ferritin concentration and reduced total iron-binding capacity are typical of anemia of chronic diseases, such as an autoimmune disease. Increased levels of cytokines such as interleukin-6 lead to increased hepatic production of hepcidin that stops ferroportin from releasing storage iron, promoting sequestration of storage iron, with poor use for erythropoiesis. The secretion of erythropoietin by the kidney is impaired. Various underlying diseases, including cancer, collagen vascular diseases, and chronic infections, can produce this pattern of anemia. An iron deficiency would produce microcytic anemia, with a low serum ferritin level and reduced hepcidin production. Aplastic anemia is unlikely because the platelet count and WBC count are normal. Megaloblastic anemias are macrocytic without an increase in iron stores. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias are caused by serious acute conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation; these patients have thrombocytopenia caused by widespread thrombosis.

        "question": "Bleeding manifestation of Hemophilia is",
        "exp": "(B) Hemarthrosis[?]. Hemophilia is an X linked disorder of coagulation caused by the deficiency in a circulating plasma protein. o. Hemophilia A is caused by the deficiency of factor VIII, and hemophilia B is caused by the deficiency of factor IX. o. It is PTT which is affected (increased) and not PT (unaffected). o. Factor VIII is involved in the intrinsic pathway which is measured by PTT and not in extrinsic pathway which is measured as PT. o. Bleeding is the common manifestation of hemophilia and the common bleeding manifestations are Hemarthoses, Hematomas, Mucocutaneous bleeding, Intracranial bleeding, Hematuria and Pseudotumor. i|SITES OF BLEEDINGSerious. Life-threatening* Joints (Hemarthrosis)* Central Nervous System (CNS)* Muscle/soft tissue* Gastrointestinal (GI)* Mouth/gums/nose* Neck/throat* Hematuria* Severe trauma [?]. Clinical Manifestations: Hemarthrosiso. Pathophysiology:-Bleeding probably starts from synovial vessels into the synovial space.-Re-absorption of this blood is often incomplete leading to chronic proliferative synovitis, where the synovium is more thickened & vascular, creating a 'target joint' with recurrence of bleeding.-There is destruction of surrounding structures as well-bone necrosis & cyst formations, osteophytes.-Terminal stage: Chronic Hemophiliac arthropathy: Fibrous or bony ankylosing of the joint. o. Defects of secondary hemostasis (coagulation factor defects) often present with bleeds into soft tissues (e. g., muscle) or joints. Bleeding into joints (hemarthrosis) following minor trauma is particularly characteristic of hemophilia. o. It is unknown why severe defects in secondary hemostasis present with this peculiar pattern of bleeding; as with severe platelet defects, intracranial hemorrhage, sometimes fatal, may also occur. Other Options[?]. Hemoptysis:-Diseases causing repeated haemoptysis include carcinoma, bronchiectasis, carcinoid tumours and some infections.-Severe mitral stenosis is now a rare cause. Patients with repeated haemoptysis should be investigated, at the very least by chest radiography and bronchoscopy.-Haemoptysis following trauma may be from a lung contusion or injury to a major airway. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. [?]. Hematomas:-If large, painful or causing neural deficit, a haematoma may require release by incision or aspiration.-In the gluteal or thigh region, there may be an associated disruption of fat in the form of a fat fracture, which results in an unsightly groove but intact skin.-An untreated haematoma may also calcify and therefore require surgical exploration if symptomatic. [?]. Hematuria:-Blood in the urine (haematuria) may be the only indication of cancer and other pathology in the urinary tract.-Microscopic haematuria may be detected by dipstick testing in a routine health check. A substantial haemorrhage imparts a red or brownish tinge to the urine (macroscopic haematuria) and the patient may pass clots.",

The rapid expansion of the marrow caused by proliferation of blasts can lead to bone pain and tenderness.

Anemia and thrombocytopenia result from suppression of normal hematopoiesis by the leukemic clone in the marrow. The phenotype of CD19+, CD3-, and s. Ig- is typical of pre-B cells.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Atransferrinemia [Ref: www. ironcurriculum. esh. org/activity/1848pdfi* Derangement in serum iron indices mentioned in the question: -Microcytic hypochromic anemia Low serum iron - Normal (50-170 mg/dl) High serum ferritin - Normal (30-400 ng/ml). High serum transferrin - Normal (30-50%). Let's look at the options first Iron deficiency anemia. Can be easily ruled out as serum ferritin is low in Iron deficiency anemia. Hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is characterized by increased serum iron level. So, we are left with two options. Atransferrinemia and DMT1 mutation. These are classified in genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia. Here is a brief discussion on genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia. Genetic forms of Iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is an acquired disease. It is generally associated with low cost diet and bleeding. Recent advances in iron metabolism led to the recognition of new entities of iron deficiency anemia in non bleeding and \"high cost diet\" nourished individuals. These are known as genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia. Apparently rare these genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia should be recognized by hematologists as they are refractory to classical oral or intravenous iron administration. These includes. Mutations in gene encoding DMT1. Mutations in gene encoding glutaredoxin 5. Hypotransferrinemia or Atransferrinemia. Deficiency of ceruloplasmin. IRIDA (Iron Recractory, Iron Deficiency Anemia). Genetic forms of Iron deficiency anemia DMT1 Mutation. Atransferrinemia. Glutaredoxin 5. Aceruloplasminemia. Age at diagnosis. At birth. Late onset. Midlife. Late onset. Anemia.

Not yet measured. Not yet measured. Not yet measured. Coming back to the question. The serum iron indices of the patient match those of Atransferrinemia i. e., low serum iron increased serum ferritin, increased transferring saturation. DMT1 can be ruled out as it has low ferritin level and high iron level. Atransferrinemia. Transferrin is an iron carrying protein that transmits iron to the erythroblasts. Atransferrinemia or hypotransferrinemia results in reduced delivery of iron to erythroblasts and development of iron deficient anemia. This leads to massive but futile iron absorption. The increased iron that is absorbed is not carried to the erythroid cell, instead, it is deposited elsewhere outside of erythroblasts. Iron is deposited in the visceral organs rather than in the bone marrow. DMT1 mutation. DMT1 is a transmembrane protein involved in dietary nonheme iron uptake at the brush border of duodenal enterocytes and also plays crucial role in iron utilization at the endo somal membrane of the erythroid precursors. In DMT1 mutation the iron absorption in the duodenum continues because the absorption of heme iron is not affected. The mutation primarily affects iron utilization and not absorption. Iron utilization in erythroid precursors is disturbed leading to severe iron deficiency anemia.",

It could be a nutritional deficiency in children and pregnant women, but more likely is due to chronic blood loss in adults. The ferritin concentration is a measure of storage iron because it is derived from the total body storage pool in the liver, spleen, and marrow. About 80% of functional body iron is contained in hemoglobin; the remainder is in muscle myoglobin. Individuals with severe liver disease can have an elevated serum ferritin level because of its release from liver stores. A bone marrow biopsy specimen provides a good indication of iron stores because the iron stain of the marrow shows hemosiderin in macrophages, but such a biopsy is an expensive procedure. Some patients with hemoglobinopathies, such as b-thalassemia, also can have microcytic anemia, but this is far less common than iron deficiency. The serum haptoglobin level is decreased with intravascular hemolysis, but the anemia is normocytic because the iron can be recycled. The serum iron concentration or transferrin level by itself gives no indication of iron stores because, in anemia of chronic disease, the patient's iron level can be normal to low, and the transferrin levels also can be normal to low, but iron stores are increased.

Laboratory studies show an elevated level of rheumatoid factor. CBC shows hemoglobin, 11. 6 g/dL; hematocrit, 34. 8%; MCV, 87 mm3; platelet count, 268, 000/ mm3; and WBC count, 6800/ mm3. There is a normal serum haptoglobin level, serum iron concentration of 20 mg/ dL, total iron-binding capacity of 195 mg/dL, percent saturation of 10. 2, and serum ferritin concentration of 317 ng/mL. No fibrin split products are detected. The reticulocyte concentration is 1. 1%. What is the most likely mechanism underlying this patient's hematologic abnormalities?",
        "exp": "The iron concentration and iron-binding capacity are low; however, in contrast to the finding in anemia of iron deficiency, the serum ferritin level is increased. This increase is typical of anemia of chronic disease. In this case, the chronic disease is rheumatoid arthritis. Underlying chronic inflammatory or neoplastic diseases increases the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-g. These cytokines promote the sequestration of iron in storage compartments and depress erythropoietin production. Autoantibody hemolytic anemias occur in several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but not usually in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as in this case. Normal serum haptoglobin rules out intravascular hemolysis; iron is recycled at a rapid rate. Impaired synthesis of b-globin chains gives rise to b-thalassemia, also characterized by hemolysis. Complement lysis is enhanced in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which results from mutations in the PIGA gene. Patients with this disorder have a history of infections. Sequestration of RBCs in the spleen occur when RBC membranes are abnormal, as in hereditary spherocytosis or sickle cell anemia, or RBCs are coated by antibodies, as in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Metastases are space-occupying lesions (myelophthisic process) that can lead to leukoerythroblastosis, with nucleated RBCs and immature WBCs appearing on the peripheral blood smear.",

        "exp": "(A) Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL or DLBL)[?]. Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomao. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of NHL. o. Each year in the United States there are about 25, 000 new cases. o. There is a slight male predominance. The median patient age is about 60 years, but DLBCL also occurs in young adults and children. Germinal centre or post germinal center B cello. Diverse chromosomal re-arrangements, most often BC26 (30%), BCL2 (10%), or C-MYC (5%). o. All ages, most common in Adults, 30% extranodal, aggressiveo. THC positive for CD10, CD20, CD10 & BCL6o. Pathogenesis:-Genetic, gene expression profiling, and immunohistochemical studies indicate that DLBCL is molecularly heterogeneous.-One frequent pathogenic event is dysregulation of BCL6, a DNA-binding zinc-finger transcriptional repressor that is required for the formation of normal germinal centers.-About 30% of DLBCLs contain various translocations that have in common a breakpoint in BCL6 at chromosome 3q27.-Acquired mutations in BCL6 promoter sequences that abrogate BCL6 autoregulation (an important negative-regulatory mechanism) are seen even more frequently. o. Immunophenotype:-These mature B-cell tumors express CD19 and CD20 and show variable expression of germinal center B-cell markers such as CD10 and BCL6. Most have surface Ig. o. Special Subtypes: Immunodeficiency-associated large B-cell lymphoma, Primary effusion lymphomao. Clinical Features:-DLBCL typically presents as a rapidly enlarging mass at a nodal or extranodal site.-It can arise virtually anywhere in the body.-Waldeyer ring, the oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue that includes the tonsils and adenoids, is involved commonly.-Primary or secondary involvement of the liver and spleen may take the form of large destructive masses.-Extranodal sites include the gastrointestinal tract, skin, bone, brain, and other tissues.-Bone marrow involvement is relatively uncommon and usually occurs late in the course.-Rarely, a leukemic picture emerges. Other Options[?]. Hairy cell Leukemia:-This rare but distinctive B-cell neoplasm constitutes about 2% of all leukemias.-Hairy cell leukemias are associated in more than 90% of cases with activating point mutations in the serine/threonine kinase BRAF, which is positioned immediately downstream of RAS in the MAPK signaling cdscade[?]. Burkitt's lymphoma:-Within the category of Burkitt Lymphoma fall (1) African (endemic) Burkitt lymphoma, (2) sporadic (non-endemic) Burkitt lymphoma, and (3) a subset of aggressive lymphomas occurring in individuals infected with HIV.-Burkitt lymphomas occurring in each of these settings are histologically identical but differ in some clinical, genotypic, and virologic characteristics.-All forms of Burkitt lymphoma are highly associated with translocations of the MYC gene on chromosome 8 that lead to increased MYC protein levels.-Essentially all endemic Burkitt lymphomas are latently infected with EBV, which is also present in about 25% of HIV-associated tumors and 15% to 20% of sporadic cases.-Characteristic \"starry sky\" pattern.-When the bone marrow is involved, aspirates reveal tumor cells with slightly clumped nuclear chromatin, two to five distinct nucleoli, and royal blue cytoplasm containing clear cytoplasmic vacuoles. [?]. Mantle Cell lymphoma:-Mantle cell lymphoma is an uncommon lymphoid neoplasm that makes up about 2. 5% of NHL in the United States and 7% to 9% of NHL in Europe.-It usually presents in the fifth to sixth decades of life and shows a male predominance.-As the name implies, the tumor cells closely resemble the normal mantle zone B cells that surround germinal centers.-Virtually all mantle cell lymphomas have an (11; 14) translocation involving the IgH locus on chromosome 14 and the cyclin D1 locus on chromosome 11 that leads to over expression of cyclin D1.-Most common presentation is painless lymphadenopathy.-Symptoms related to involvement of the spleen (present in -50% of cases) and gut are also common.",
