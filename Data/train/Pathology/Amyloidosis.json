Initially, the deposits appear in the glomeruli: within the mesangia] matrix and along the basement membranes of the capillary loops. The glomerular architecture is almost totally obliterated by the massive accumulation of amyloid (arrow heads). Continuous accumulation of the amyloid will compress and obliterate the capillary tuft. With progression, amyloid deposits appear alsoperitubular and within the arteriolar wall, narrowing them (Large arrow). Congo red is a special staining, elective for amyloid. Renal involvement gives rise to proteinuria that may be severe enough to cause the nephrotic syndrome. Progressive obliteration of glomeruli in advanced cases ultimately leads to renal failure and uremia.
