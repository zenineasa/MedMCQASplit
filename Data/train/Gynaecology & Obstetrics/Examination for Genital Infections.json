There are often multiple small punctate strawberry spots on vaginal vault and portio vaginalis of cervix-- the so-called strawberry cervix/vagina.# Actively motile Trichomonads can be seen on wet film preparation or parasite can be cultured on feinberg-Whittington medium.# Treatment is metronidazole 200 mg tid for 7 days for both partners.# In first trimester of pregnancy -Trichofuran suppositories, Vinegar douche and betadine gel are useful.
