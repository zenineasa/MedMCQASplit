If the fetal head is at station below this or rotation doesn't exceed 45, then one can apply outlet forceps.

Two Subdivisions: Rotation of 45o or less from the occipito - anterior position. Rotation of more than 45o including the occipito - posterior position Mid Fetal head is no more than 1/5th palpable per abdomen Leading point of the skull as is above station plus 2 cm but not above the ischial spines.

Indications of Operative delivery: Fetal Indication: Presumed fetal compromise Maternal To shoen and reduce the effects of the second stage Cardiac disease Class III or IV hypeensive crises, myasthenia gravis, spinal cord injury patients at risk of autonomic dysreflexia, proliferative retinopathy Inadequate progress Nulliparous women - lack of continuing progress for 3 hours with regional anaesthesia, or 2 hours without regional anaesthesia Multiparous women - lack of continuing progress for 2 hours with regional anaesthesia, or 1 hour without regional anaesthesia Maternal fatigue/exhaustion Prerequisites for operative vaginal delivery Head is <=1/5th palpable per abdomen Veex presentation Cervix is fully dilated and the membranes ruptured. Assessment of caput and moulding. Pelvis is deemed adequate. Irreducible moulding may indicate cephalo-pelvic dispropoion Although traditional teaching says that vacuum can be applied after 6-7 cms cervical dilatation, Forceps and vacuum extractor deliveries before full dilatation of the cervix are contraindicated. Forceps can be used for the after-coming head of the breech Avoid use of vacuum extraction below 34 weeks +0 days of gestation susceptibility of the preterm infant to cephalohaematoma, intracranial haemorrhage, subgaleal haemorrhage and neonatal jaundice. Higher rates of failure with instrumental delivery are associated with: maternal body mass index over 30 estimated fetal weight over 4000 g or clinically big baby occipito-posterior position mid-cavity delivery or when 1/5th of the head palpable per abdomen. Vacuum extraction compared with forceps is: more likely to fail delivery more likely to be associated with cephalhaematoma more likely to be associated with retinal haemorrhage less likely to be associated with significant maternal perineal and vaginal trauma Forceps and Vacuum have same likelihood of Delivery by caesarean section Associated with low 5-minute Apgar Associated with the need for phototherapy",

The mechanism by which hemostasis is achieved at the placental site is vasoconstriction, produced by a well contracted myometrium. Intravenous or intramuscular oxytocin (10 U intramuscularly or 20 U in a 1000-mL intravenous bottle), ergonovine (0. 2 mg intramuscularly or intravenously), or prostaglandin F2I+- (0. 25 mg intramuscularly and repeated if necessary at 15- to 90-minute intervals up to a maximum of eight doses) helps the uterus contract and decreases blood loss.

        "exp": "Methylergometrine (Methergine) can be used in treatment of PPH. Absolute contraindications: 1. Heart disease in pregnancy. Hereafter the delivery of the placenta, almost 1000 ml of blood from the uterus goes back into the maternal circulation and this is a considerable load on an already weak heart. If Methylergometrine is used, then this extra blood is shifted much more rapidly to the systemic circulation casing a heart failure and a resultant Pulmonary Edema. 2. Chronic hypertension/preeclampsia/eclampsia.. similar reason i. e. too much blood into already hyperdynamic hypeesnive circulation. 3. After the delivery of the first baby of the twins. (It can be given after second baby delivery of twin.) 4. Rh iso immunization Hence, if the patient has a heart disease and develops PPH, methergine is absolutely contraindicated as it can cause heart failure.",

Increase in levels of antifibrinolytic Types 1 & 2, plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI type 1 & 2.

The paograph is a graphic record of the progress of labour and relevant details of the mother and fetus The WHO paograph begins only in the active phase of labour, when the cervix is 4 cm or more dilated Observations to be made: Maternal well - being: Pulse every 30 minutes Blood pressure and temperature 4-hourly Urine output and dipstick testing for protein Ketones (if available) and glucose after vooding Fetal well - being: Record fetal heart rate for 1 minute every 15-30 minutes after a contraction in the first stage Every 5 minutes in the second stage If abnormalities are noted, urgent delivery can be considered. Liquor: Clear Meconium stained (thick or thin) Bloody Absent Thick meconium suggests fetal distress Moulding 0= bones are separated and sutures can be easily felt; +1 = bones are just touching each other; +2 = bones are overlapping but can be reduced; +3 = bones are severely overlapping and irreducible. Cervical dilatation: assess at each VAGINAL EXAMINATION and mark with a cross x. Begin at 4 cm. Ale line: staing at 4 cm of cervical dilatation, up to the point of expected full dilatation at the rate of 1 cm per hour. Action line: parallel and 4 hours to the right of the ale line. Descent of head: assessed by abdominal palpation: this refers to the pa of the head (which is divided into five pas) palpable above the symphysis pubis; recorded as a circle (O)at every vaginal examination. At 0/5, the sinciput (S) is at the level of the symphysis pubis. PLEASE NOTE: Newer guidelines are now suggesting onset of active labour and thus initial marking to be plotted at 6 cm dilatation. However till consensus is achieved on this, the previous definition of 4 cm shall be accepted for answering. Students should be on the lookout for such a guideline.",
