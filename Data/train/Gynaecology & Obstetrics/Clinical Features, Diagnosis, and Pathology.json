It typically occurs during 2nd trimester (20-22) weeks of pregnancy.During red degeneration, the myomas become tense, tender and causes severe abdominal pain with constitutional upset and fever.Although the patient is febrile with moderate Leucocytosis and raised E.S.R., the condition is an aseptic one.It needs to be differentiated from appendicitis, twisted ovarian cyst, pyelitis and accidental hemorrhage.During the red degeneration, the tumour itself assumes a peculiar purple red colour and develops a fishy odour. If the tumour is carefully examined, some of the large veins in the capsule and the small vessels in the substance of the tumour will be found thrombosed. The discoloration is possibly caused by diffusion of blood pigments from thrombosed vessels.Conservative treatment with analgesia, reassurance and supportive therapy is almost always adequate.Also knowAnother complication of myoma which is seen during pregnancy is torsion of the myoma.Torsion of the myoma is also characterized by acute abdominal pain with point tenderness over the site of leiomyoma.Conservative t/t is adequate.",

Because of this arrangement of blood supply, the central portion of the tumour receives the least blood supply, and degeneration is noticeable early and most often in this part of the tumour. On the other hand, calcification begins at the periphery and spreads inwards along the vessels.Microscopically, the tumour consists of bundles of plain muscle cells, separated by varying amount of fibrous strands. Areas of embryonic muscle tissue may be present in a myoma.The endometrium tends to be thicker due to endometrial hyperplasia. The ovaries at times are enlarged, cystic and hyperaemic with evidence of salpingo-oophoritis in about 15% cases.Points to be Remembered in FibroidMost common complication of fibroid during pregnancy- Red degenerationIncidence of sarcomatous change in fibroid - 0.5 %Most common presenting symptom is menorrhagiaMetrorrhagia is caused by - sub mucus fibroidMost common degeneration - Hyaline degeneration.Recurrent pregnancy loss is associated with submucous fibroidPolycythemia in myoma is due to extramedullary erythropoisis within the substance of myomaDanazole.

There is a false capsule of connective tissue. It has a higher potential for sarcomatous change than subserous fibroid.# Important sign is nonencapsulation.Fibroids can undergo several types of degeneration:# Hyaline degeneration: this is the most common type of degeneration (can occur in -60%).# Cystic degeneration: -4 %.# Myxoid degeneration: generally considered uncommon although reported as high a 50% by some authors# Red - carneous degeneration: due to haemorrhagic infarction, which can occur particularly during pregnancy. Red degeneration of fibroid is common in pregnancy especially the third trimester.# Red degeneration presents almost exclusively in pregnancy with acute pain, fever and localized tenderness. It is due to aseptic inflammation and thrombosis. It is usually managed conservatively.Additional Educational Points:# Most common type of uterine myoma is intramural.",
