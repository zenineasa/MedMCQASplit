        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e. 2nd Trimester Red degeneration of the myomas. Red degeneration of uterine myomas develops most frequently during pregnancy. It typically occurs during 2nd trimester (20-22) weeks of pregnancy. During red degeneration, the myomas become tense, tender and causes severe abdominal pain with constitutional upset and fever. Although the patient is febrile with moderate Leucocytosis and raised E. S. R., the condition is an aseptic one. It needs to be differentiated from appendicitis, twisted ovarian cyst, pyelitis and accidental hemorrhage. During the red degeneration, the tumour itself assumes a peculiar purple red colour and develops a fishy odour. If the tumour is carefully examined, some of the large veins in the capsule and the small vessels in the substance of the tumour will be found thrombosed. The discoloration is possibly caused by diffusion of blood pigments from thrombosed vessels. Conservative treatment with analgesia, reassurance and supportive therapy is almost always adequate. Also know. Another complication of myoma which is seen during pregnancy is torsion of the myoma. Torsion of the myoma is also characterized by acute abdominal pain with point tenderness over the site of leiomyoma. Conservative t/t is adequate.",

Hyaline degenerationo The most common (65%) type of degeneration affecting all sizes of fibroids except the tiny one. o It is common specially in tumors having more connective tissues. The central part of the tumor which is least vascular is the common site. o The feel becomes soft elastic in contrast to firm feel of the tumor. o Naked eye examination on the cut surface shows irregular homogenous areas with loss of whorl-like appearanceo Microscopic examination reveals hyaline changes of both the muscles and fibrous tissues. Cystic degenerationo Usually occurs following menopause and is common in interstitial fibroidso It is formed by liquefaction of the areas with hyaline changes. Fatty degenerationo Usually found at or after menopause. Fat globules are deposited mainly in the muscle cells. Calcific degeneration (10%)o Usually involves the subserous fibroids with small pedicle or myomas of postmenopausal women. It is usually preceded by fatty degeneration. o There is precipitation of calcium carbonate or phosphate within the tumor.

        "exp": "Ans: (b) Intramural Ref: Shaw s Textbook of Gynaecology 15th Edition Pg 352. Explanation: Uterine Fibroids. Fibroids are the most common benign solid tumours in females. Most common tumour of uterus. Fibroids are estrogen dependent for growth. Progesterone inhibits their growth. Gn. RH shrinks size of fibroid. Increases in size during pregnancy and OCP intake. Decreases in size after menopause. The presence of myoma causes hyperplasia of the myometrial wall. The cavity of the uterus is often distorted and enlarged. The endometrium tends to be thicker due to endometrial hyperplasia. The ovaries at times are enlarged, cystic and hyperaemic with evidence of salpingo- oophoritis in about 15% cases. Distribution of fibroid in the body of uterus: Intramural 75%Submucus 15%Subserous 10%Most common site is body of uterusA typical myoma is a w ell-circumscribed tumour with a pseudocapsule. The vessels which supply blood to the tumour lie in the capsule and send radial branches into the tumour. Because of this arrangement of blood supply, the central portion of the tumour receives the least blood supply, and degeneration is noticeable early and most often in this part of the tumour. On the other hand, calcification begins at the periphery and spreads inwards along the vessels. Microscopically, the tumour consists of bundles of plain muscle cells, separated by varying amount of fibrous strands. Areas of embryonic muscle tissue may be present in a myoma. The endometrium tends to be thicker due to endometrial hyperplasia. The ovaries at times are enlarged, cystic and hyperaemic with evidence of salpingo-oophoritis in about 15% cases. Points to be Remembered in Fibroid. Most common complication of fibroid during pregnancy- Red degeneration. Incidence of sarcomatous change in fibroid - 0. 5 %Most common presenting symptom is menorrhagia. Metrorrhagia is caused by - sub mucus fibroid. Most common degeneration - Hyaline degeneration. Recurrent pregnancy loss is associated with submucous fibroid. Polycythemia in myoma is due to extramedullary erythropoisis within the substance of myoma. Danazole. Gn.
