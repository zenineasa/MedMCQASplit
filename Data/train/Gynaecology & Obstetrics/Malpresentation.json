Coming to the question- patient is a multigravida with previous 2 normal deliveries: As history of normal delivery is present, it rules out uterine anomaly.

The vulva is much distended by the submento-vertical diameter 11. 5 cm.* Following internal rotation, the mentum is below the maternal symphysis, and delivery occurs by flexion of the fetal neck. As the face descends onto the perineum, the anterior fetal chin passes under the symphysis and flexion of the head occurs, making delivery possible with maternal expulsive forces. The above mechanisms of labor in the term infant can occur only if the mentum is anterior and at term, only the mentum anterior face presentation is likely to deliver vaginally. If the mentum is posterior or transverse, the fetal neck is too short to span the length of the maternal sacrum and is already at the point of maximal extension. The head cannot deliver as it cannot extend any further through the symphysis and cesarean delivery is the safest route of delivery.* Option (a) persistent brow presentation, vaginal delivery is not possible 8c will require LSCS* Option (b) as the head is extented, delivery occurs by flexion.# In mento anterior face, a vaginal delivery is possible.# Mento posterior face, vaginal delivery is not possible 8c requires LSCS* Option (c) & (d): in both the head is flexed 8c delivery takes place by extension.",
