This poses a difficulty in diagnosis of adenomyosis, which is a pathological invasion of the endometrium.# Novak and Woodruff criteria: presence of heterotopic endometrium atleast 1 high power field (HPF) below the basal endometrium.# Bensen and Sneeden's criteria: Presence of ectopic endometrium (glands and stroma) at least two standard low power fields (= 4 mm) beneath the myometrial junction, and associated with adjacent myohyperplasia. o Grading of Adenomyosis:# Molitor's criteria: According to the depth of penetration: i) Grade I Inner 1/3 rd of myometriumii) Grade II Middle 1/3 rd of myometriumiii) Grade III: Outer 1 /3 rd of myometriumo Grading of Bird et al:# Mild: 1-3 glands/ LPF# Moderate: 4-9 glands / LPF# Severe: > 9 glands / LPFo Treatment# Medical management: Danazol, Gn.

Absent fructose in semen means block is below the level of seminal vesicles which is not allowing sperms from testis and seminal fluid with fructose from seminal vesicle to be present in the semen. This means there is an obstructive pathology. The best way to detect obstruction is to perform a Transrectal Ultrasound.

If a woman exercises too much, she is at a risk of losing too much of her body fat. Body fat plays an essential role in the production of estrogen; without enough estrogen, a woman who over-exercises might not ovulate. The technical term for not ovulating is oligomenorrhea, and is a major cause of fertility problems. Women who don't get enough exercise can impact their fertility negatively as well. By not getting enough exercise, a woman runs the risk of becoming overweight or obese. style=\"font-size: 1. 04761904761905em; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif\">An overweight or obese woman, because she has more fat cells, can actually have too much estrogen.
