This negative feedback mechanism disrupts ovulation by interfering with the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis and gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary. Specifically, the progestin component suppresses luteinizing hormone release and the LH surge, which is necessary for ovulation, and the estrogen component suppresses the follicle stimulating hormone, which prevents the selection and maturation of the dominant follicle.",

Used alone, failure rate is high, approximately 30 per 100 woman years. When used in conjunction with a mechanical barrier, they give a reliable contraceptive effect. The spermicidal agent remains effective for 1-2 hrs after application. Adverse reactions: By causing irritation and abrasions in chronic use, they can cause vaginal ulceration. Increase the risk of HIV spread rather than prevent it. Therefore, the spermicidal agents should not be recommended to HIV couples. A new spermicidal cream, Tenofovir, prevents viral attachment to the vaginal mucosa and is non-irritant and is underdevelopment. The use of condoms with spermicidal agents and postcoital agents as back-up technique is effective in avoiding pregnancy. Ref: Shaw&; s textbook of Gynaecology 17th edition pgno: 255",
