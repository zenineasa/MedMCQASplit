INHIBIN Useful For# An aid in the diagnosis of patients with granulosa cell tumors of the ovary when used in combination with inhibin B# Monitoring of patients with granulosa cell tumors and epithelial mucinous-type tumors of the ovary known to secrete inhibin AClinical Information# Inhibins are heterodimeric protein hormones secreted by granulosa cells of the ovary in the female and Sertoli cells of the testis in the male. They selectively suppress the secretion of pituitary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and also have local paracrine actions in the gonads. The inbibins consist of a dimer of 2 homologous subunits, an alpha subunit and either a beta A or beta B subunit, to form inhibin A and inhibin B, respectively. In females, inhibin A is primarily produced by the dominant follicle and corpus luteum: whereas inhibin B is predominantly produced by small developing follicles. Serum inhibin A and B levels fluctuate during the menstrual cycle. At menopause, with the depletion of ovarian follicles, serum inhibin A and B decrease to very low or undetectable levels. Ovarian cancer is classified into 3 types: epithelial, stromal sex cord, and germ cell tumors. Epithelial ovarian tumors account for 90% of cases and are further subdivided into: serous (70%), mucinous (10%-15%), and endometrioid (10%-15%) types. Granulosa cell tumors represent the majority of the stromal sex cord tumors, which account for 2% to 5% of all ovarian tumors, n Inhibin seems to be a complementary' to cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) as an ovarian cancer marker. CA 125 is not as good of a tumor marker for mucinous and granulosa ovarian cell tumors. Inhibin shows a better performance in those 2 types of ovarian cancer.",

SEROUS TUMORS* Serous tumors are the most frequent ovarian epithelial tumors. The malignant forms account for 40% or more of ovarian cancers.* During frozen section evaluation, psammoma bodies are essentially pathognomonic of an ovarian-type serous carcinoma. MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMAS* About 5 to 10 percent of true epithelial ovarian cancers are mucinous adenocarcinomas* These cells resemble cells of the endocervix or may mimic intestinal cells, which can pose a problem in the differential diagnosis of tumors that appear to originate from the ovary or intestine. ENDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMAS* About 15 to 25 percent of epithelial ovarian cancers are endometrioid adenocarcinomas, the second most common histologic type. CLEAR CELL TUMORS* Comprising 5 to 10 percent of epithelial ovarian cancers, clear cell adenocarcinomas are the most frequently associated with pelvic endometriosis.* Microscopically hobnail cells are characteristic finding. These are cells with abundant glycogen and nuclei of the cells protrude into the glandular lumen. BRENNER TUMOR* These tumors constitute only 2% to 3% of all ovarian tumors.* Brenner tumors consist of cells that resemble the transitional epithelium of the bladder and Walthard nests of the ovary.",
