An endometrioma may be associated with symptoms of endometriosis (eg, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia) or identified at the time of evaluation for a pelvic mass or infertility. Ovarian endometrioma is a benign condition, associated with raised CA-I25.\"Endometriomas usually present as a pelvic mass arising from growth of ectopic endometrial tissue within the ovary. Thev typically contain thick brown tar-like fluid (hence the name \"chocolate cyst\") and are often densely adherent to surrounding structures, such as the peritoneum. fallopian tubes, and bowel. An endometrioma may be associated with symptoms of endometriosis (eg. pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia) or identified at the time of evaluation for a pelvic mass or infertility. A woman with a ruptured endometrioma may initially present with peritoneal signs and symptoms, elevated white blood cell count, and low grade fever, similar to patients with acute pelvic inflammatory disease or appendicitis. \"\"Ovarian endometrioma is a benign condition, associated with raised CA-I25. \"Conditions Associated with Raised CA-125Neoplastic conditions GynecologicalNon-gynecologicalBenign conditions* Ovarian carcinoma (nonmucinous)* Endometrial carcinoma* Tubal carcinoma* CAIung* CA breast* CA pancreas* CA colon* Endometriosis* PID* Tuberculosis* Leiomyoma* Pregnancy* Menstruation* Hemorrhagic ovarian cysts* Liver diseaseLower abdominal pain and dysmenorrhea with chocolate cyst (Ovarian endometriosis) with blue-grey tattooing of the cyst is seen in given laparoscopic examination picture. This is highly suggestive of endometriosis.\"Chocolate Cyst: it is caused by endometriosis, and formed when a tiny patch of endometrial tissue (the mucous membrane that makes up the inner layer of the uterine wail) bleeds, sloughs off, becomes transplanted, and grows and enlarges inside the ovaries, As the blood builds up over months and years, it turns brown. When it ruptures, the material spills over into the pelvis and onto the surface of the uterus, bladder, bowel, and the corresponding spaces in between. \"\"The diagnosis of ovarian endometriosis is facilitated by careful inspection of all sides of both ovaries, which may be difficult when adhesions are present in more advanced stages of disease. With superficial ovarian endometriosis, lesions can be both typical and subtle. Larger ovarian endometriotic cysts (endometrioma) are usually located on the anterior surface of the ovary and are associated with retraction, pigmentation, and adhesions to the posterior peritoneum. These ovarian endometriotic cysts often contain a thick, viscous dark brown fluid (\"uchocolate fluid\") composed of hemosiderin derived from previous intraovarian hemorrhage. \"-- Novak s 13/e p388EndometriosisPresence of ectopic functional endometrial tissue is known as endometriosis.

On examination, her height was 58 inches. Most probable diagnosis in this patient is Turners (XO) syndrome. Absence of oocytes in the ovaries (streak ovaries) would be the histopathological finding in Turners syndrome.Increased serum FSH and absent breast indicates primary ovarian failure. This is mostly caused by 'Gondal Dysgenesis ' (Turner's syndrome). Elevated FSH is due to absence of ovarian oocytes and follicles leading to reduction in negative feedback on FSH from estradiol and inhibins A and B.Evaluation of Primary Amenorrhea:Primary amenorrhea is evaluated most efficiently by focusing on the presence or absence of:Breast Development:It is a marker of estrogen action and therefore function of the ovaryPresence or absence of uterus:As determined by ultrasound or in more complex cases by MRIEvaluation of Primary AmenorrheaBreast Development:Breast development and other secondary sexual characters are markers of estrogen action and therefore function of the ovaryPresence of breast and other secondary sexual features indicate normal estrogen level and normally functioning ovaryAbsence of Breast:Absence of breast indicates reduced estrogen levelThe cause of reduced estrogen level is then determined by measuring FSHIncreased serum FSH and absent breast indicates primary ovarian failure. This is mostly caused by 'Gondal Dysgenesis' (Turner's syndrome). Elevated FSH is due to absence of ovarian oocytes and follicles leading to reduction in negative feedback on FSH from estradiol and inhibins A and B.Absent breast with decreased serum FSH indicates primary amenorrhea due to hypothalamic or pituitary causes.Presence or absence of uterus:Further testing for a women with primary amenorrhea depends upon the findings on physical examination in particular whether mullerian structures are present or absent (Mullerian structures: Cervix, uterus, vagina, ovarian tube)The single most important step in the evaluation of primary amenorrhea depends upon the findings on physical examination or ultrasonography, whether there are any anatomic abnormalities of the vagina, cervix or uterus.Absence of Uterus:Absence of uterus usually means that Mullerian inhibitory substance was secreted at the time of Wolffian duct development.Mullerian inhibiting substance is usually secreted from the sertoli cells of the testis and it inhibits the development Wolffian duct or Mullerian duct structures.Absence of uterus suggests presence of MIs and is likely evidence of the presence of testis.For those with absence of the uterus, further evaluation should include a karyotype measurement and measurement of serum testosterone.These tests allow the clinician to distinguish between abnormal Mullerian development and androgen insensitivity syndrome.Absence of Uterus:For patients with normal Mullerian structures and no evidence of an imperforate hymen, vaginal septum, or congenital absence of vagina, an endocrine evaluation should be performed.This includes measurement of serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin to exclude pregnancy and of serum FSH and other hormones.A high serum FSH concentration is indicative of primary ovarian failure.A karyotype is then required to detect the presence of Turner's syndromeTurner's syndrome is characterized by the complete or partial deletion of X chromosome.In addition, evaluation for other diseases associated with specific type of ovarian failure should be performed.Low or normal FSH suggests functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, congenital GnPH deficiency or other disorders of hypothalamic pituitary axis.Serum prolactin is measured if galactorrhoea is present.If there are signs of hyperandrogenism, serum ketosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) should be measured.Turners SyndromeMC karyotype is 45 XO, rest are 45XO/46XX, 45XO/46XY ( mosaics)Loss of one X chromosome is due to non-disjunctionQ during meiosis, the X chromosome retained is maternal in originQ in most cases.MC chromosome disorder in human beings.Presentation:Most affected fetus are aborted spontaneouslyQ (but MC chromosomal anomaly in 1st trimester is Trisomy)IUGR is common.In neonatal period:Slow growthQPresence of shield chest, cystic hygroma, lymphedemaQCardiac defects: Coarctation of aorta (MC), bicuspid aortic valve, mitral valve prolapse, aortic aneurysmQUrinary tract malformations, MC is Horse shoe shaped kidneyQAt Puberty:Primary amenorrhoea, failure to mature and infertilityQ.Absent secondary sexual characteristics (due to bilateral streak gonads, no estrogen secretion leading to undeveloped breast, absent axillary and pubic hair)QHormonal profile: Raised FSH and LH, decreased estrogen and progesteroneQElevated FSH is due to absence of ovarian oocytes and follicles leading to reduction in negative feedback on FSH from estradiol and inhibins A and B.Clinical features:Characteristic features are short stature, widely spaced nipples, webbed neckQAdditional features:Micrognathia, exaggerated epicanthal fold, low set earsQSensorineural hearing loss, otitis media (conductive hearing loss)QLow posterior hair line, colour blindness, high arched palateQBroad shield like chest, lack of breast development, shortened 4th metacarpalQCubitus valgusQ, hyperconvex nail, multiple pigmented naeviPatients are prone to:Colon cancerQAutoimmune disorders (Hashimotos thyroiditis, Addison's disease.
