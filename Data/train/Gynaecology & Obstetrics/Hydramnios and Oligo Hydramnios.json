It is associated with low implantation of the placenta; there is chance of the cord compression in vaginal delivery leading to foetal anoxia and even death. Succenturiate placenta: An extra placenta separates from the main placenta. Velamentous cord insertion is an abnormal condition during pregnancy. Normally, the umbilical cord inserts into the middle of the placenta as it develops. In Velamentous cord insertion, the umbilical cord inserts into the fetal membranes (chorioamniotic membranes), then travels within the membranes to the placenta (between the amnion and the chorion). The exposed vessels are not protected by Wharton's jelly and hence are vulnerable to rupture. Rupture is especially likely if the vessels are near the cervix, in which case they may rupture in early labor, likely resulting in a stillbirth. Early detection can reduce the need for emergency cesarean sections",

The vessels are torn sequentially/ following rupture of membranes. This is the only condition where antepartum hemorrhage is of fetal origin. Sanger's alkali denaturation test (Apt's test) is the confirmatory test. Diagnosis. The classic triad of the vasa praevia is: Membrane rupture. Painless vaginal bleeding. Fetal bradycardia.

Oligohydramnios is a condition in pregnancy characterized by a deficiency of amniotic fluid. It is the opposite of polyhydramnios. Diagnosis: Diagnosis is made by ultrasound measurement of the amniotic fluid index (AFI) <5cm. Several different methods exist for calculating AFI, that produce different index numbers below which oligohydramnios is said to be present. Causes: It is typically caused by fetal urinary tract abnormalities such as bilateral renal agenesis (Potters syndrome), fetal polycystic kidneys, or genitourinary obstruction. Uteroplacentalinsufficiency is another common cause. Most of these abnormalities can also be detected by obstetric ultrasound. It may also occur without a determinable cause (idiopathic). Complications: Cord compression, musculoskeletal abnormalities such as facial distortion and clubfoot, pulmonary hypoplasia and intrauterine growth restriction. Amnion nodosum is frequently also present (nodules on the fetal surface of the amnion). Congenital Anomalies Associated with Oligohydramnios: Amnionic band syndrome. Cardiac--Fallot tetralogy, septal defects. Central nervous system--holoprosencephaly, meningocele, encephalocele, microcephaly. Chromosomal abnormalities: triploidy, trisomy 18, Turner syndrome. Cloacal dysgenesis. Cystic hygroma. Diaphragmatic hernia. Genitourinary--renal agenesis, renal dysplasia, urethral obstruction, bladder exstrophy, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, prune-belly syndrome. Hypothyroidism. Skeletal--sirenomelia, sacral agenesis, absent radius, facial clefting. Twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion (TRAP) sequence. Twin-to-twin transfusion.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. B/L renal agenesis Polyhydramnios is defined as a state where liquour amni exceeds 2000 ml. Amniotic fluid measures about 50 ml at 12 weeks, 400 ml at 20 weeks and reaches its peak of 1 litre at 36-38 weeks. There after the amount diminishes till at term it measures about 600-800 ml Amniotic fluid formation:- Early pregnancy - Ultrafiltrate of plasma Beginning of 2nd trimester - Composed largely of extracellular fluid that diffuses through the fetal skin. After 20 weeks - Cornification of fetal skin prevents this diffusion and the amniotic fluid is composed largely of fetal urine. The fluid in the amniotic fluid is completely changed and replaced in every 3 hours. Causes of increase in amniotic fluid (Polyhydramnios). Because the fetus normally swallows the amniotic fluid and excretes it through urine it has been assumed that this mechanism is one of the ways by which the volume is controlled. Thus renal agenesis will lead to oligohydramnios not polyhydramnios. Anencephaly causes polyhydramnios because of transudation from exposed meninges and absence of fetal swallowing reflex. Open spina bifida leads to polyhydramnios because of transudation of meninges. Causes of polyhydramnios Maternal. Ph isoimmunisation. Diabetes Placental. Placental chrioangioma. Circumvallate placenta syndrome Fetal. Multiple pregnancy. Fetal anomalies. CNS abnormalities (Anencephaly)G. L abnormalities (Oesophageal or duodenal atresia)G. U. abnormalities. Skeletal malformations. Fetal tumours. Cardiac anomalies. Chromosomal abnormalities. Genetic syndromes. Hematological disorders. Intrauterine infections. Miscellaneous Idiopathic. Complications of Polyhydramnios: Most of the maternal complications of polyhydramnios arise purely from pressure exerted within the overdistended uterus and upon adjacent organs. Which are. Respiratory discomfort. Premature rupture of membrane. Premature labour. Pregnancy induced hypertension. Abruptio placenta. Cord prolapse. Placental insufficiency. Post partum hemorrhage. Fetal complications: Fetal morbidity and mortality is significant in cases of polyhydramnios. The major causes of mortality are congenital abnormalities incompatible with life.",
