        "exp": "Ans. is d, i.e. Selective progesterone receptor modulatorRef: Harrison's Principles of Internal medicine 19th/ed, p2391Ulipristal acetate (trade name Ella One in the European Union, Ella in the US for contraception, and Esmya for uterine fibroid) is a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM).PharmacodynamicsAs an SPRM, ulipristal acetate has partial agonistic as well as antagonistic effects on the progesterone receptor. It also binds to the glucocorticoid receptor, but is only a weak anti-glucocorticoid relative to mifepristone, and has no relevant affinity to the estrogen, androgen and mineralocorticoid receptors. Phase II clinical trials suggest that the mechanism might consist of blocking or delaying ovulation and of delaying the maturation of the endometrium.Medical Uses* Emergency contraception: For emergency contraception, a 30mg tablet is used within 120 hours (5 days) after an unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. It has been shown to prevent about 60% of expected, pregnancies, and prevents more pregnancies than emergency contraception with levonorgestrel.* Treatment of uterine fibroids: Ulipristal acetate is used for preoperative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age in a daily dose of a 5mg tablet. Treatment of uterine fibroids with ulipristal acetate for 13 weeks effectively controlled excessive bleeding due to uterine fibroids and reduced the size of the fibroids.InteractionsUlipristal acetate is metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro. Ulipristal acetate is likely to interact with substrates of CYP3A4, like rifampicin, phenytoin, St John's wort, carbamazepine or ritonavir. Therefore, concomitant use with these agents is not recommended. It might also interact with hormonal contraceptives and progestogens such as levonorgestrel and other substrates of the progesterone receptor, as well as with glucocorticoids.Adverse EffectsCommon side effects include abdominal pain and temporary menstrual irregularity or disruption. Headache and nausea were observed under long-term administration (12 weeks), but not after a single dose.ContraindicationsUlipristal acetate should not be taken by women with severe liver diseases because of its CYP-mediated metabolism. It has not been studied in women under the age of 18.Pregnancy: Unlike levonorgestrel, and like mifepristone, ulipristal acetate is embryotoxic in animal studies. Before taking the drug, a pregnancy must be excluded.",

Systolic versus end diastolic flow velocity (S/D flow) in the umbilical vessels, middle cerebral artery, and ductus venosus.UMBILICAL ARTERY DOPPLERThis test measures the ratio of systolic and diastolic blood flow in the umbilical artery.The umbilical circulation normally has low resistance, so significant diastolic blood flow is expected.The systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio normally decreases throughout pregnancy.Umbilical artery S/D ratio is gestational age-dependent.The S/D ratio normally decreases from approximately 4.0 at 20 weeks to 2.0 at term, and it is generally less than 3.0 after 30 weeks.Because of downstream impedance to flow, more end-diastolic flow is observed at the placental cord insertion than at the fetal ventral wall. Thus, abnormalities such as absent or reversed end-diastolic flow will appear first at the fetal cord insertion site.This test is predictive of poor perinatal outcome only in IUGR foetuses.Non-reassuring findings, which may indicate need for delivery, are absent diastolic flow and reversed diastolic flow.Note:-This notch disappears at 24 weeks of pregnancy as the resistance of uterine artery decreases due to trophoblastic invasion. There is no diastolic notch in late second and third trimester.

Women should record their BBT for evidence of ovulation. In addition, serial serum progesterone levels may be helpful to confirm ovulation. Serum progesterone values should be obtained 7 days after ovulation and may also be helpful in evaluating inadequate luteal phase. An endometrial biopsy may also provide valuable information regarding the status of the luteal phase. The biopsy is obtained 12 days after the thermogenic shift, or 2 to 3 days before the expected onset of menses, on about day 26 of a 28-day cycle. A postcoital test is an in vivo test that evaluates the interaction of sperm and cervical mucus. It is performed during the periovulatory period up to 12 h after coitus. The cervical mucus is obtained, and its quantity and quality as well as its interaction with the sperm are evaluated. The hysterosalpingogram is performed in the mid follicular phase in order to evaluate the fallopian tubes and the contour of the uterine cavity; it should not be done while the patient is menstruating or after ovulation has occurred.

        "exp": "Since this patient has other signs of pubertal development which are sex steroid-dependent, we can conclude some ovarian function is present. This excludes such conditions as gonadal dysgenesis and hypothalamic-pituitary failure as possible causes of her primary amenorrhea. Mullerian defects are the only plausible cause, and the diagnostic evaluation in this patient would be directed toward both confirmation of this diagnosis and establishment of the exact nature of the Mullerian defect. Mullerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, presents as amenorrhea with absence of a vagina. The incidence is approximately 1 in 10,000 female births. The karyotype is 46, XX. There is normal development of breasts, sexual hair, ovaries, tubes, and external genitalia. There are associated skeletal (12%) and urinary tract (33%) anomalies. Treatment generally consists of progressive vaginal dilation or creation of an artificial vagina with split-thickness skin grafts (Mclndoe procedure). Testicular feminization, or congenital androgen insensitivity syndrome, is an X-linked recessive disorder with a karyotype of 46, XY. These genetic males have a defective androgen receptor and/or downstream signal transduction mechanism (in the genome) such that the androgenic signal does not have its normal tissue-specific effects. This accounts for 10% of all cases of primary amenorrhea. The patient presents with an absent uterus and blind vaginal canal. However, in these patients the amount of sexual hair is significantly decreased. Although there is a 25% incidence of malignant tumors in these patients, gonadectomy should be deferred until after full development is obtained. In other patients with a Y chromosome, gonadectomy should be performed as early as possible to prevent masculinization. Patients with gonadal dysgenesis present with lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome typically have a karyotype of 47, XXY and a male phenotype. Causes of primary amenorrhea, in descending order of frequency, are gonadal dysgenesis, Mullerian agenesis, and testicular feminization.

        "exp": "True sexual precocity in girls is characterized by normal gonadotropin levels (as opposed to expected low prepubertal gonadotropin levels) and a normal ovulatory pattern. It represents premature activation of a normally operating hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Although it is usually idiopathic, true sexual precocity can arise from cerebral causes such as tumors or a history of encephalitis or meningitis, as well as from hypothyroidism, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, neurofibromatosis, and other disorders. In girls who have precocious pseudo puberty, the endocrine glands, usually under neoplastic influences, produce elevated amounts of estrogens (isosexual precocious pseudo puberty) or androgens (heterosexual precocious pseudo puberty). Ovarian tumors appear to be the most common cause of isosexual precocious pseudo puberty; some ovarian tumors, including dysgerminomas and choriocarcinomas, can produce so much gonadotropin that pregnancy tests are positive. Incomplete sexual precocity, which is usually idiopathic, is characterized by only partial sexual maturity, such as premature thelarche or premature adrenarche (pubarche). Incomplete sexual precocity can be accompanied by abnormal function of the central nervous system (e.g., mental deficiency). Gonadotropin levels are frequently normal in these patients. In gonadotropin-producing tumors, high levels of gonadotropins such as FSH are produced with subsequent production of estrogen. Examples of these rare tumors are hepatoma, chorioepithelioma, and presacral tumors.",

        "question": "A 22-year-old woman consults you for treatment of hirsutism. She is obese and has facial acne and hirsutism on her face and periareolar regions and a male escutcheon. Serum LH level is 35 mIU/mL and FSH is 9 mIU/mL. Androstenedione and testosterone levels are mildly elevated, but serum DHAS is normal. The patient does not wish to conceive at this time. Which of the following single agents is the most appropriate treatment of her condition?",
        "exp": "This patient has polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), diagnosed by the clinical picture, abnormally high LH-to-FSH ratio (which should normally be approximately 1:1), and elevated androgen but normal DHAS. DHAS is a marker of adrenal androgen production; when normal, it essentially excludes adrenal sources of hyperandrogenism. Several medications have been used to treat hirsutism associated with PCOS. For many years contraceptives were the most frequently used agents; they can suppress hair growth in up to two-thirds of treated patients. They act by directly suppressing ovarian steroid production and increasing hepatic binding globulin production, which binds circulating hormone and lowers the concentration of metabolically active (free unbound) androgen. However, clinical improvement can take as long as 6 months to manifest. Other medications that have shown promise include medroxyprogesterone acetate, spironolactone, cimetidine, and GnRH agonists, which suppress ovarian steroid production. However, GnRH analogues are expensive and have been associated with significant bone demineralization after only 6 months of therapy in some patients. Surgical wedge resection is no longer considered an appropriate therapy for PCOS given the success of pharmacologic agents and the ovarian adhesions that were frequently associated with this surgery.",

Hot flashRef: Shaws Textbook of Gynecology 16th Ed; Page No-74HORMONE REPLACEMENTTHERAPYBenefits and RisksEstrogen therapy is the most effective FDA-approved method for relief of menopausal vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes), it is also used in genitourinary atrophy and dyspareunia.Hot flashes:Excess amount of sweating and sensation of heat is felt by 75% of menopausal women.It is mediated through the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center.Due to peripheral conversion of androgens to estrone in their peripheral adipose tissues; obese women are less commonly to undergo hot flashes.The Womens Health Initiative (WHI) study of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) studied 27,000 postmenopausal women with a mean age of 63 years. These included women with a uterus on hormone therapy (HT), both estrogen and progestin, and hysterectomized women on estrogen therapy (ET) only.CRITIQUE OF WOMEN'S HEALTH INITIATIVE STUDYExcludes patients with vasomotor symptomsPrimary indication for hormone replacementMean patient age was 63 yearsMissed the 10-year \"window of opportunity\"Same dose of hormone for all agesOlder women don't need as a high dose as do younger womenPatients were not all healthyHypertension (40%), t cholesterol (15%), diabetes mellitus (7%), myocardial infarction (3%)Benefits: Both HT and ET groups in WHI had decreased osteoporotic fractures and lower rates of colorectal cancer.Risks: Both HT and ET groups in WHI were found to have small increases in deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
