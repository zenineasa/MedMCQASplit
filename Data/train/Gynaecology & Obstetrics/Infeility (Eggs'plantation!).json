The spermatozoa move up the uterus to the isthmus of the uterine tubes, where they slow down and undergo capacitation. Near the time that the egg enters the ampulla of the tube, sperm initiate the capacitationprocess and are released from the oviduct epitheliumin a hyperactivated state This fuher maturation process involves two components: Increasing the motility of the spermatozoa and facilitating their preparation for the acrosome reaction.

In simple terms, there is non recognition of the body's estrogens by the hypothalamus due to the blockade of estrogens receptors by CC and hence the hypothalamus directs the pituitary to make more of FSH which in turn drives the ovary to make a follicle to make estrogens.The development of follicle is the preceeding event before ovulation.",
