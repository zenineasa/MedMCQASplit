Brain tumors which increase Gn. RH output may also lead to premature pubey. The cause of the Gn. RH rise is unknown. Leptin might be the cause of the Gn. RH rise. Leptin has receptors in the hypothalamus which synthesizes Gn. RH. Individuals who are deficient in leptin fail to initiate pubey. The levels of leptin increase with the onset of pubey, and then decline to adult levels when pubey is completed. The rise in Gn. RH might also be caused by genetics. A study discovered that a mutation in genes encoding both Neurokinin B as well as the Neurokinin B receptor can alter the timing of pubey. The researchers hypothesized that Neurokinin B might play a role in regulating the secretion of Kisspeptin, a compound responsible for triggering direct release of Gn. RH as well as indirect release of LH and FSH.",

The absence of Y chromosome resembles the female, but these patients are, like males, chromatin negative, i. e. their nuclei contain no nuclear satellite body and no drumsticks in the neutrophils. It has also been called ovarian agenesis or gonadal dysgenesis because at laparotomy the gonad is found to consist of undifferentiated stroma with absence of sex cells, a mere strip of fibrous tissue attached to the back of the broad ligament like a pale strip, the so-called streak gonad. The follicles grow up to 20th week of fetal life but become atretic due to absence of one X sex chromosome. In some, germ cells fail to migrate to the genital ridge from the yolk sac. These ovaries do not contain Graafian follicles, so oestrogen is not produced. The patients are clinically of sho stature though not actual dwarfs, the trunk is muscular, the neck is sho and webbed, cubitus valgus is notable. The breasts are not developed and pubic, and axillary hair is scanty or absent. Exaggerated epicanthic folds may be present, one of the obvious defects first noticeable on examining the patient. The vagina and uterus, if present, are underdeveloped. Other gross congenital abnormalities are present such as coarctation of the aoa. Deformities of the digits are also seen. Other stigma of Turner's syndromes includes shield chest, high palate, low-set ears, lymphoedema of the extremities at bih and deafness. The stigma is due to chromosomal deficiency in the sho arm of X chromosome and is not always present (seen in 20%-30%), and the percentage of stigma depends on the percentage of abnormal X chromosome. The classical picture of Turner's syndrome as described should have a chromosomal pattern of XO. However, there are variants in which mosaicism of XO/XX or even XO/XY produce less clear-cut syndromes, e. g. a normal appearing female apa from gonadal dysgenesis. The young girl with Turner's syndrome presents with primary amenorrhoea. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is above 40 m. IU/mL and E2 is below 25 pg/mL. Oestrogen therapy with intermittent progesterone is advised to prevent osteoporosis. Aificial vagina may be needed at a later date for sexual function. Administration of growth hormone 0. 05 mg daily for 5 years near pubey will improve the height. A pregnancy can occur with the donor egg in IVF programme if the uterus is present. If few follicles persist after pubey, menstruation and pregnancy is possible (15%). Incidence of Turner's syndrome is 1: 2000 to 1: 5000 live born girls.

Mullerian agenesis (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the etiology in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea. Because most of the vagina does not develop from the Mullerian duct, instead developing from the urogenital sinus along with the bladder and urethra, it is present even when the Mullerian duct is completely absent. Ovaries are normal Hormonal levels are normal",

Consequently, the vagina, cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes develop normally and the internal and external genitalia do not masculinize but due to hypoestrogenism breasts are poorly developed.
