But the maximum incidence of this is found in use of sympathomimetics. Beta Agonist (such as ritodrine) infusion can cause serious and even fatal maternal side effects. The cause of pulmonary edema is multifactorial. Risk factors Include tocolytic therapy with B-agonists, multifetal gestation, concurrent coicosteroid therapy, tocolysis for more than 24 hours large intravenous crystalloid volume infusion. B-agonists have been implicated in increased capillary permeability, cardiac rhythm disturbances, and myocardial ischemia.",
