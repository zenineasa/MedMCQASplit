Toxoplasmosis: Causative organism: Toxoplasma gondii Definitive host: Cat Perinatal problems: Primary infection in pregnancy causes fetal abnormalities due to transplacental transmission Earlier infection: Increased severity of infection (maximum in the first trimester). But, only 10% are infected in the first trimester. Risk of transmission increases with the period of gestation, but the risk of teratogenicity decreases. Severe disease: Tetrad of hydrocephalus or microcephaly, convulsions, chorioretinitis and cerebral calcification. Diagnosis: Acute infection: IgG and IgM antibodies or four fold increase in paired specimens 4 weeks apa. Management: Spiramycin Pyrimethamine: Sulfonamide (to be avoided inn first trimester)-when fetal infection is confirmed. Ref: Williams Obstetrics 25th edition Pgno: 1226",
