Most women have minimal or mild endometriosis, which is characterized by superficial implants and mild adhesions. Moderate and severe endometriosis is characterized by chocolate cysts and more severe adhesions. The stage of endometriosis does not correlate with the presence of or severity of symptoms; with stage IV endometriosis, infertility is very likely. \"",
