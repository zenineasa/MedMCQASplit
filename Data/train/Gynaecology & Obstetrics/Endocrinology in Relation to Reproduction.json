These are surrounded by flat cells and are called primordial follicles and are present in the cortex of the ovary. o At birth, there is no more mitotic division and all the oogonia are replaced by primary oocytes which have finished the prophase of the first meiotic division and remain in resting phase (dictyotene stage) between prophase and metaphase. o Total number of primary oocytes at birth is estimated to be about 2 million. The primary oocytes do not finish the first meiotic division until puberty is reached. o At puberty, some 400, 000 primary oocytes are left behind, the rest being atretic.

Mammogenesis: Growth of both ductal and lobuloalveolar systems occurs in pregnancy2. Lactogenesis: Colostrum secretion is noted during pregnancy and immediately post delivery. Milk secretion starts around the third postpartum day. Despite high prolactin levels in pregnancy, milk is not secreted as the high levels of estrogen and progesterone make the breast tissue unresponsive. With withdrawal of estrogen and progesterone levels post delivery, prolactin acts on the breast tissue. Growth hormone, thyroxine and insulin also increase secretory activity. 3. Galactokinesis: Milk is discharged due to the infant's suckling efforts and also a contractile mechanism which expresses milk from the alveoli into the ducts. Oxytocin is a major galactokinetic hormone.# Milk ejection reflex: Reflex by which milk is forced down into the ampulla of the lactiferous duct, where it can be sucked out by the baby. 4. Galactopoeisis: The most important hormone is prolactin. Suckling is essential for effective and continuous lactation. Periodic feeding is essential to relieve the pressure which then maintains the secretion.",
