        "exp": "Ans. d. Retroplacental hemorrhage (Ref: Dutta's 7/e pe p224) Retroplacental hemorrhage is not a part of HELLP syndrome. HELLP syndrome is an acronym for Hemolysis (H), Elevated liver enzymes (EL) and Low Platelet count (LP) of < 1, 00, 000/mm3. HELLP Syndrome. It is an acronym for Hemolysis (H), Elevated liver enzymes (EL) and Low Platelet count (LP) of < 1, 00, 000/mm3. It is a rare complication of pregnancy induced hypertension. It may be associated even with mild hypertension and proteinuria. Clinical Features: Manifested by nausea, vomiting, epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, along with biochemical and haematological changes. Parenchymal necrosis of liver causes elevation in hepatic enzymes (AST and ALT > 70 IU/L and LDH > 600 IU/L). There may be subcapsular hematoma formation (which may need CT scanning) and abnormal peripheral smear. Eventually liver may rupture to cause sudden hypotension, due to hemoperitoneum. Treatment: The principles of management are the same as that for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Anti-seizure prophylaxis with magnesium sulphate is started. Administration of corticosteroids improves perinatal and maternal outcome. Corticosteroids can increase the pulmonary maturity and reduce the incidences of intraventriuclar hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis in the fetus. Caesarean section is the most common mode of delivery. Epidural anaesthesia can be safely used if the platelet count is > 1, 00, 000/mm3. Platelet transfusion should be given if the count is < 50, 000/mm3. The recurrence risk is 3 -10%.",

        "exp": "Ans: C (Vomiting) SEVERE PREECLAMPSIA Harrison 17th/44. It is the presence of new-onset hypertension and proteinuria accompanied by central nervous system [CNS) dysfunction (headaches, blurred vision, seizures, coma), marked elevations of blood pressure (>160/110 mm. Hg), severe proteinuria (>5 g/24h), oliguria or renal failure^', pulmonary- edema', hepatocellular injury (ALT > 2 x the upper limits of normal), thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100, 000/L), or disseminated intravascular coagulation. The HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low- platelets) syndrome is a special subgroup of severe preeclampsia and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this disease. The presence of platelet dysfunction and coagulation disorders further increases the risk of stroke. Note. Women with mild preeclampsia are those with the diagnosis of new-onset hypertension, proteinuria, and edema without evidence of severe preeclampsia. Table (William's Obstetrics). Diagnosis of Hypertensive Disorders Complicating Pregnancy Gestational hypertension. BP >140/90 mm Hg for first time during pregnancy. No proteinuria. BP returns to normal <12 weeks' postpartum. Final diagnosis made only postpartum. May have other signs or symptoms of preeclampsia, for example, epigastric discomfort or thrombocytopenia Preeclampsia. Minimum criteria. BP >140/90 mm Hg after 20 weeks' gestation. Proteinuria 2300 mg/24 hours or >1+ dipstick. Increased certainty of preeclampsia. BP 160/110 mg Hg. Proteinuria 2. 0 g/24 hours or >2+ dipstick. Serum creatinine >1. 2 mg/dL unless known to be previously elevated. Platelets < 100, 000/mm3. Microangiopathic hemolysis (increased LDH). Elevated ALT or ASTPersistent headache or other cerebral or visual disturbance. Persistent epigastric pain Eclampsia. Seizures that cannot be attributed to other causes in a woman with preedampsia.
