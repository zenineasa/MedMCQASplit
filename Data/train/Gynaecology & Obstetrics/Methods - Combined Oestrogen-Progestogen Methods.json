Side effects were common, and that formula was soon taken off the market. Nowadays, the highest dose available is 50 micrograms of estrogen, but even that is rarely prescribed anymore. Today, most pills have 35 micrograms or less of estrogen, an amount that's generally called \"low dose. \" In recent years there's been a trend toward even lower levels of hormones. \"Ultra-low-dose\" pills have 20 micrograms of estrogen or less.",

Current pills contain on average 30 to 35 mg. Pills containing less than 50 mg of ethinyl estradiol. Several preparations containing only 20 mg of ethinyl estradiol are not available. These are often used for perimenopausal women who want contraception with the lowest estrogen dose possible. These preparations provide enough estrogen to relieve vasomotor flashes. Third-generation progestins. More selective progestins include norgestimate, desogestrel, and gestodene. They have some structural modifications that lower their androgen activity. The new progestins are not much less androgenic than norethindrone. Low dose OC pills# These are defined as OC pills with estrogen content (ethinyl estradiol) of > 50 microgram.# However in developed countries nowadays use low dose OC pills containing 20 microgram estrogen, while in India the estrogen content is 30 micrograms ( Mala-N, Mala-D).# Simple regimen of \"3 weeks on and 1 week off' is followed.",
