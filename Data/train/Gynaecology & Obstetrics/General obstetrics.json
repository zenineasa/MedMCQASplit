        "exp": "Naegele's pelvis: This type of pelvis is extremely rare. It is produced due to arrested development of one ala of the sacrum. (i) Congenital or (ii) Acquired (osteitis of sacroiliac joint). Congenital variety may be associated with urinary tract and may of the same side. The pelvis is obliquely contracted at all levels but more marked in the outlet. Ilio-pectineal line on the affected side is almost straight. Scoliosis involving only the lumbar region will cause deformity of the pelvis. The acetabulum is pushed inwards on the weight bearing side. This may be pronounced if the disease occurs during early life. Oblique asymmetry of the pelvis results in contraction of one of the oblique diameters. Cesarean section is the only safe method of delivery. Robe's pelvis (transversely contracted pelvis): This is an extremely rare abnormality. Ala of both the sides are absent and the sacrum is fused with the innominate bones. Delivery is done by cesarean section. Kyphotic pelvis: It is secondary to the kyphotic changes of the veebral column either following tuberculosis or rickets. The sacrum is tilted backwards in the upper pa and forwards in the lower pa. It is narrow and straight. The anteroposterior diameter of inlet is increased but is diminished at the outlet. Subpubic angle is narrow. Thus, the feature is an extreme funnelling of the pelvis. Abdomen becomes pendulous due to the shoened distance between the symphysis pubis and xiphisternum. Malpresentation is common. Mechanical distress is evident. Cesarean section is ideal and one may have to do the classical operation because of poor formation of the lower segment or for technical reasons. RACHITIC FLAT PELVIS: Rickets is predominantly a disease of early childhood when the bones remain soft and unossified. In childhood changes occur in the bony pelvis due to weight bearing. Inlet: Sacral promontory is pushed downwards and forwards producing a \"reniform\" shape of the inlet with marked shoening of the antero-posterior diameter without affecting the transverse diameter, which is often increased. Cavity: Sacrum is flat and tilted backwards. There may be sharp angulation at the sacrococcygeal joint. Outlet: Body weight transmitted through the ischium in sitting position results in widening of the transverse diameter of the outlet and the pubic arch. OSTEOMALACIC PELVIS: The deformity is caused by softening of the pubic bones due to deficiency of calcium and vitamin D and lack of exposure to sunrays. It usually affects women after they have reached maturity. The promontory is pushed downwards and forwards and the lateral pelvic walls are pushed inwards causing the anterior wall to form a beak. The shape of the inlet thus becomes triradiate. Approximation of the two ischial tuberosities occurs. Sacrum is markedly shoened, Coccyx is pushed forward. Cesarean section is ideal.

In contrast, the recipient becomes polycythemic and may develop circulatory overload manifest as hydrops. The donor twin is pale, and its recipient sibling is Plethoric. Diagnosed based on two criteria: (1) presence of a monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy, and (2) hydramnios defined if the largest veical pocket is >8 cm in one twin and oligohydramnios defined if the largest veical pocket is < 2 cm in the other twin. Once identified, TTTS is typically staged by the Quintero staging system: Stage I--discordant amnionic fluid volumes, but urine is still visible sonographically within the bladder of the donor twin. Stage II--criteria of stage I, but urine is not visible within the donor bladder. Stage III--criteria of stage II and abnormal Doppler studies of the umbilical aery, ductus venosus, or umbilical vein. Stage IV--ascites or frank hydrops in either twin. Stage V--demise of either fetus. Management and Prognosis: is related to Quintero stage and gestational age at presentation. Several therapies are currently used for TTTS, including amnioreduction, laser ablation of vascular anastomoses, selective feticide, and septostomy (intentional creation of a communication in the dividing amniotic membrane).

Normally, this measures 10 cm or more, but it cannot be measured directly with examining fingers. Thus, for clinical purposes, the obstetrical conjugate is estimated indirectly by subtracting 1. 5 to 2 cm from the diagonal conjugate, which is determined by measuring the distance from the lowest margin of the symphysis to the sacral promontory 7. The transverse diameter is constructed at right angles to the obstetrical conjugate and represents the greatest distance between the linea terminalis on either side. It usually intersects the obstetrical conjugate at a point approximately 5 cm in front of the promontory and measures approximately 13 cm 8. Each of the two oblique diameters extends from one sacroiliac synchondrosis to the contralateral iliopubic eminence.

X-ray pelvimetry is a poor predictor of pelvic adequacy and success of vaginal delivery. However, X-ray pelvimetry is useful in cases with fractured pelvis and for the impoant diameters which are inaccessible to clinical examination (see below). Techniques: For complete evaluation of the pelvis, three views are taken -- anteroposterior, lateral and outlet. But commonly, X-ray pelvimetry is restricted to only the erect lateral view (the femoral head and acetabular margins must be superimposed) which gives most of the useful information. Anteroposterior view can give the accurate measurement of the transverse diameter of the inlet and bispinous diameter. Limitations of X-ray pelvimetry: The following are the prognostic significances of the successful outcome of labor: (1) Size and shape of the pelvis; (2) Presentation and position of the head; (3) Size of the head; (4) Moulding of the head; (5) Give way of the pelvis; and (6) Force of uterine contractions. Out of these many unknown factors, X-ray pelvimetry can only identify one factor, i. e. size and shape of the pelvis. Thus, it can only supplement the clinical assessment of pelvis but cannot replace the clinical examination. Otherwise it is true that satisfactory progress of labor is the best indicator of pelvic adequacy. Hazards of X-ray pelvimetry includes radiation exposure to the mother and the fetus. With conventional X-ray pelvimetry radiation exposure to the gonads is about 885 millirad. So it is restricted to selected cases only. Diagnostic range of radiation exposure (less than 5 rads) is not associated with any significant congenital malformation either in human or in animal.

One takes advantage of the differing ploidy to distinguish paial (triploid) moles from diploid entities. Another technique involves histological immunostaining to identify the p57. KIP2 nuclear protein. Because the gene that expresses p57. KIP2 is paternally imprinted, only maternally donated genes are expressed. Because complete moles contain only paternal genetic material, they cannot express this gene; do not produce p57. KIP2; and thus, do not pick up this immunostain. In contrast, this nuclear protein is strongly expressed in paial moles and in non-molar pregnancies with hydropic change. As a result, the combined use of ploidy analysis and p57. KIP2 immunostaining can be used to differentiate: (1) a complete mole (diploid/p57. KIP2-negative), (2) a paial mole (triploid/p57.

Total pulmonary resistance is reduced due to progesterone effect.

The mucosa of the nasopharynx becomes hyperemic and edematous. This may cause nasal stuffiness and rarely epistaxis. Hyperventilation occurs during pregnancy leading to increase in tidal volume and therefore respiratory minute volume by 40%.

RBF is increased by 50-75%, maximum by the 16 weeks and is maintained until 34 weeks. Thereafter it falls by 25%. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is increased by 50% all throughout pregnancy. Increased GFR causes reduction in maternal plasma levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid. Renal tubules fail to reabsorb glucose, uric acid, amino acids, water soluble vitamins and other substances completely. Ureter: Ureters become atonic due to high progesterone level. Dilatation of the ureter above the pelvic brim with stasis is marked on the right side specially in primigravidae. It is due to dextrorotation of the uterus pressing the right ureter against the pelvic brim and also due to pressure by the right ovarian vein which crosses the right ureter at right angle. The stasis is marked between 20-24 weeks. There is marked hyperophy of the muscle and the sheath of the ureter specially the pelvic pa probably due to estrogen. There is elongation, kinking and outward displacement of the ureters. Bladder: There is marked congestion with hyper-trophy of the muscles and elastic tissues of the wall. In late pregnancy, the bladder mucosa becomes edematous due to venous and lymphatic obstruction especially in primigravidae following early engagement. Increased frequency of micturition is noticed at 6-8 weeks of pregnancy which subsides after 12 weeks. It may be due to resetting of osmoregulation causing increased water intake and polyuria. In late pregnancy, frequency of micturition once more reappears due to pressure on the bladder as the presenting pa descends down the pelvis. Stress incontinence may be observed in late pregnancy due to urethral sphincter weakness. Reference: Dutta's Textbook of Obstetrics 7th edition page 54",

Angiotensin-Conveing Enzyme Inhibitors. These drugs inhibit the conversion of angiotensin-I to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin-II. They can cause severe fetal malformations when given in the second and third trimesters. These include oligohydramnios, hypocalvaria, and renal dysfunction Some studies also suggest teratogenic effects, and because of this, they are not recommended at any time during pregnancy. Angiotensin - receptor blockers act in a similar manner. But, instead of blocking the production of angiotensin-II, they inhibit binding to its receptor. They are presumed to have the same fetal effects as angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitors and thus are also contraindicated.

Placenta Accreta syndromes include any placental implantation with abnormally firm adherence to myometrium because of paial or total absence of decidua basalis and imperfect development of the fibrinoid. The increased risk conveyed by previous uterine trauma (eg., cesaerean delivery) may be paially explained by an increased vulnerability of the decidua to trophoblast invasion following incision into the decidua. Microscopically, placental villi are anchored to muscle fibers rather than to decidual cells. Decidual deficiency then prevents normal placental seperation after delivery. Variants of placental accreta syndromes are classified by the depth of trophoblastic growth: Types Definition Placenta accreta Villi are attached to the myometrium Placenta increta Villi invade the myometrium Placenta percreta Villi penetrate through the myometrium and to or through the serosa In cases of first- and second-trimester accreta syndromes, there is usually hemorrhage that is the consequence of coexisting placenta pre.

The procedure caused straightening of the sacrum relative to the lumbar veebrae, rotation of the symphysis pubis toward the maternal head, and a decrease in the angle of pelvic inclination. Although this does not increase pelvic dimensions, pelvic rotation cephalad tends to free the impacted anterior shoulder. Of rotational maneuvers, Woods (1943) repoed that by progressively rotating the posterior shoulder 180 degrees in a corkscrew fashion, the impacted anterior shoulder could be released. This is frequently referred to as the Wood's corkscrew maneuver. Rubin (1964) recommended two maneuvers. First, the fetal shoulders are rocked from side to side by applying force to the maternal abdomen. If this is not successful, the pelvic hand reaches the most easily accessible fetal shoulder, which is then pushed toward the anterior surface of the chest. This maneuver most often abducts both shoulders, which in turn produces a smaller bisacromial diameter. This permits displacement of the anterior shoulder from behind the symphysis With an all- fours maneuver, also called the Gaskin maneuver, the paurient rolls onto her knees and hands. Here, downward traction against the head and neck attempts to free the posterior shoulder The Zavanelli maneuver involves replacement of the fetal head into the pelvis followed by cesarean delivery Reference: William's obstetrics; 25th edition",
