In contrast, the recipient becomes polycythemic and may develop circulatory overload manifest as hydrops. The donor twin is pale, and its recipient sibling is Plethoric. Diagnosed based on two criteria: (1) presence of a monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy, and (2) hydramnios defined if the largest veical pocket is >8 cm in one twin and oligohydramnios defined if the largest veical pocket is < 2 cm in the other twin. Once identified, TTTS is typically staged by the Quintero staging system: Stage I--discordant amnionic fluid volumes, but urine is still visible sonographically within the bladder of the donor twin. Stage II--criteria of stage I, but urine is not visible within the donor bladder. Stage III--criteria of stage II and abnormal Doppler studies of the umbilical aery, ductus venosus, or umbilical vein. Stage IV--ascites or frank hydrops in either twin. Stage V--demise of either fetus. Management and Prognosis: is related to Quintero stage and gestational age at presentation. Several therapies are currently used for TTTS, including amnioreduction, laser ablation of vascular anastomoses, selective feticide, and septostomy (intentional creation of a communication in the dividing amniotic membrane).

One takes advantage of the differing ploidy to distinguish paial (triploid) moles from diploid entities. Another technique involves histological immunostaining to identify the p57. KIP2 nuclear protein. Because the gene that expresses p57. KIP2 is paternally imprinted, only maternally donated genes are expressed. Because complete moles contain only paternal genetic material, they cannot express this gene; do not produce p57. KIP2; and thus, do not pick up this immunostain. In contrast, this nuclear protein is strongly expressed in paial moles and in non-molar pregnancies with hydropic change. As a result, the combined use of ploidy analysis and p57. KIP2 immunostaining can be used to differentiate: (1) a complete mole (diploid/p57. KIP2-negative), (2) a paial mole (triploid/p57. KIP2-positive), and spontaneous aboion with hydropic placental degeneration (diploid/p57. KIP2-positive).

Criteria that may aid differentiation include an empty uterus, a gestational sac seen separate from the endometrium and >1 cm away from the most lateral edge of the uterine cavity, and a thin, <5-mm myometrial mantle surrounding the sac (Timor-Tritsch, 1992).

An angular pregnancy displaces the round ligament upward and outward, whereas an interstitial tubal pregnancy does not see it.

Those women who require multiple medications for control or those who are poorly controlled carry greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Tell women who take antihypeensive treatments other than ACE inhibitors, ARBs or chlorothiazide that the limited evidence available has not shown an increased risk of congenital malformation with such treatments. Angiotensin-Conveing Enzyme Inhibitors. These drugs inhibit the conversion of angiotensin-I to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin-II. They can cause severe fetal malformations when given in the second and third trimesters. These include oligohydramnios, hypocalvaria, and renal dysfunction Some studies also suggest teratogenic effects, and because of this, they are not recommended at any time during pregnancy. Angiotensin - receptor blockers act in a similar manner. But, instead of blocking the production of angiotensin-II, they inhibit binding to its receptor. They are presumed to have the same fetal effects as angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitors and thus are also contraindicated.

The procedure caused straightening of the sacrum relative to the lumbar veebrae, rotation of the symphysis pubis toward the maternal head, and a decrease in the angle of pelvic inclination. Although this does not increase pelvic dimensions, pelvic rotation cephalad tends to free the impacted anterior shoulder. Of rotational maneuvers, Woods (1943) repoed that by progressively rotating the posterior shoulder 180 degrees in a corkscrew fashion, the impacted anterior shoulder could be released. This is frequently referred to as the Wood's corkscrew maneuver. Rubin (1964) recommended two maneuvers. First, the fetal shoulders are rocked from side to side by applying force to the maternal abdomen. If this is not successful, the pelvic hand reaches the most easily accessible fetal shoulder, which is then pushed toward the anterior surface of the chest. This maneuver most often abducts both shoulders, which in turn produces a smaller bisacromial diameter. This permits displacement of the anterior shoulder from behind the symphysis With an all- fours maneuver, also called the Gaskin maneuver, the paurient rolls onto her knees and hands. Here, downward traction against the head and neck attempts to free the posterior shoulder The Zavanelli maneuver involves replacement of the fetal head into the pelvis followed by cesarean delivery Reference: William's obstetrics; 25th edition",
