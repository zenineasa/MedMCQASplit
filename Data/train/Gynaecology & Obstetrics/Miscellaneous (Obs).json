Full-term pregnancies have occurred in patients with forms of bicornuate, septate, or didelphys uteri; therefore, true prevalence may be slightly higher than currently estimated. An association exists between mullerian duct anomalies and renal anomalies such as unilateral agenesis. The bicornuate uterus results from incomplete fusion of the uterovaginal horns at the level of the fundus and accounts for approximately 10% OF mullerian duct anomalies. Patients with a bicornuate uterus and no extrauterine infertility issues usually have little difficulty conceiving. A bicornuate uterus consists of two symmetric cornua that are fused caudally, with communication of the endometrial cavities--most often at the level of the uterine isthmus. The intervening cleft of the complete bicornuate uterus extends to the internal cervical os (bicornuate unicollis), while the cleft of a partial bicornuate configuration is of variable length. A bicornuate bicollis uterus is associated with a duplicated cervix, although a degree of communication is maintained between the two horns.

        "exp": "(D) Within 5 months[?]PPCM is a structural heart muscle disease that occurs in women either at the end of pregnancy or up to five months after giving birth. Peripartum Cardiomyopathy: Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a cardiomyopathy that occurs in the third trimester or in the months following delivery and presents with congestive heart failure. The etiology is poorly understood. Treatment must include anticoagulation because of the high risk of thromboembolism. Over one third of patients have complete recovery. A risk of recurrence exists in subsequent pregnancies. Peripartum Cardiomyopathy - Pathophysiology: Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a dilated cardiomyopathy documented with echocardiographic left ventricular dysfunction occurring in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months of delivery. Patients with a prior history of myocardial disease are excluded from this definition. Risk factors include multi-parity, being black, older maternal age and preeclampsia. In a retrospective study of 123 women with PPCM, a history of hypertension was obtained in 43% of patients and twin pregnancies were reported in 13%. Idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting with heart failure secondary to LV systolic dysfunction from 1 month antepartum, up to 5 months after delivery, when no other causes of heart failure is evident. Incidence of 1: 300 to 1: 4000 pregnancies. Predisposing factors: Multi-parity, Multiple Births, Smoking, diabetes, Pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia, eclampsia or hypertension, Advanced age or teenage pregnancy. Criteria for Peripartum Cardiomyopathy: Classic: Development of Cardiac failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery. Absence of an identifiable cause for the cardiac failure. Absence of recognizable heart disease prior to the last month of pregnancy. Additional: Left ventricular systolic dysfunction demonstrated by classic Echo Cardio Graphic criteria such as depressed shortening fraction or ejection fraction. Peripartum Cardiomyopathy: Important diagnostic criteria are: Cardiac failure within last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum. No determinable cause for failure. Absence of previous heart disease. Left ventricular dysfunction as evidenced on echocardiography-Ejection fraction <45%-Left ventricular end diastolic dimension >2. 7cm/m2. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. The patients are usually multiparous & young (20-35 years). They complain of weakness, shortness of breath, cough, nocturnal dyspnoea & palpitation. Examination reveals - tachycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral oedema & pulmonary rales. Pregnancy is poorly tolerated in women with dilated cardiomyopathy. The treatment is bed rest, digitalis, diuretics (preload reduction), hydralazine or ACE inhibitors (postpartum) (after load reduction), beta blocker & anticoagulant therapy. Vaginal delivery is preferred. Epidural anaesthesia is ideal. There is no contraindication of breast feeding. Mortality is high (20-50%) due to pulmonary embolism & cerebral thrombosis. It may recur in subsequent pregnancies. Myocardial infarction is rare in pregnancy. Management is mostly as in on pregnant state. Coronary angioplasty, stenting and thrombolytic therapy has been done in pregnancy when indicated. Supine position and hypotension should be avoided. Labor: managed as with standard cardiac care. Elective delivery within two weeks of infarction should be avoided. Regional analgesia for pain in labor and p blockers for tachycardia may be used. Maternal pushing is avoided and second stage is shortened by forceps or vacuum. Syntocinon should be used in the third stage management as ergometrine may cause coronary artery spasm. Percutaneous transluminant coronary angioplasty can be done successfully around 36 weeks of pregnancy if needed.",

Stage IIIStage III is carcinoma that has extended into the pelvic sidewall. On rectal examination, there is no cancer-free space between the tumour and the pelvic sidewall. The tumour involves the lower third of the vagina, All cases with hydronephrosis or a nonfunctioning kidney are Stage III cancers. Stage III A: No extension into the pelvic sidewall but involvement of the lower third of the vagina. Stage 1. IIB: Extension into the pelvic side- wall or hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney. Stage IVStage IV is carcinoma that has extended beyond the true pelvis or has clinically involved the mucosa of the bladder and/or rectum. Stage IVA: Spread of the tumour into adjacent pelvic organs. Stage IVB: Spread to distant organs.",

Attention deficit/Hyperkinetic disorder typically identified by school age. Behavioural learning problems. Besides the above fetal problems it increase the risk of pregnancy complications related to vascular damage, such as placental insufficiency and placental abruption. Note: Carbon monoxide and nicotine are responsible for the adverse fetal effects. Both active and passive smoking are associated with these risks. Cessation of smoking increases birth weight of fetus. Smoking does not affect maternal weight during pregnancy. Smoking is protective against PIH.",
