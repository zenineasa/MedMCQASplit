        "exp": "Hyperemesis gravidarum is intractable vomiting of pregnancy and is associated with disturbed nutrition. Early signs of the disorder include weight loss (up to 5% of body weight) and ketonuria. Because vomiting causes potassium loss, electrocardiographic evidence of potassium depletion, such as inverted T waves and prolonged QT and PR intervals, is usually a later finding. Jaundice also is a later finding and is probably due to fatty infiltration of the liver; occasionally, acute hepatic necrosis occurs. Metabolic acidosis is rare. Hypokalemic nephropathy with isosthenuria may occur late. Hypoproteinemia also may result, caused by poor diet as well as by albuminuria. Patients who have hyperemesis gravidarum are best treated (if the disease is early in its course) with parenteral fluids and electrolytes, sedation, rest, vitamins, and antiemetics if necessary. In some cases, isolation of the patient is necessary. Very slow reinstitution of oral feeding is permitted after dehydration and electrolyte disturbances are corrected. Therapeutic abortion may be necessary in rare instances; however, the disease usually improves spontaneously as pregnancy progresses.",

If the fetus is premature and if hemorrhaging is not severe, vaginal examination of a woman suspected of having placenta previa frequently can be delayed until 37 weeks gestation; this delay in the potentially hazardous examination reduces the risk of prematurity, which is often associated with placenta previa. Vaginal examination, when needed to determine whether a low- lying placenta is covering the internal os of the cervix, should be performed in an operating room fully prepared for an emergency cesarean section (i. e., a double setup).

        "question": "A female at 37 wks of gestation has mild labour pain for 10 hours and cervix is persistently 1. CM dilated but non effaced. What will be next appropriate management?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Sedation and wait * It is a case of prolonged latent phase of the labour. Latent phase of the labour. Latent phase of the labour is difficult to define. It starts with onset of painful regular uterine contractions and end when the cervix starts dilating at an active rate. A latent phase exceeding 6 hours in primigravida or 4 hours in multigravida is considered prolonged. Secondary arrest of active phase. Active phase of the labour is defined as phase when active cervical dilatation occurs. Secondary arrest of cervical dilatation occurs when cervical dilatation ceases after a normal portion of active phase dilatation. This is believed to be due to cephalopelvic disproportion. Prolonged latent phase. The diagnosis of prolonged labour is made when there is little progress in cervical dilatation for several hours. (In the question the cervix is dilated for 1 cm for the last 10 hrs). More common than the diagnosis of prolonged latent phase is the need to differentiate whether a patient is in false labour or in the latent phase. This differentiation may be achieved by continuous observation of the patient for at least 2 hours. Patients in false labour will show a pattern of irregular uterine contractions that eventually decrease in frequency and intensity and there are no cervical changes during the observation periods. Whereas patients in latent phase will show persistent regular uterine contractions that usually increase in intensity and frequency. In addition, patient in latent phase will show some cervical changes. A second method used to differentiate false labour from the latent phase of labour is therapeutic rest. For this purpose the patient is given a 15 mg dose of morphine sulfate. Patients in false labour. Sleep for a few hours and awake without contractions. Patients in latent phase continue with contractions and show cervical changes after the sleeping period. The second most common practical problem related to the latent phase of labour occurs when patients have 3 or 4 cm of cervical dilatation and regular uterine contractions and no progress is observed during the following few hours. These patients may be in a late stage of their latent phase or have an early secondary arrest of dilatation. To distinguish between late latent phase and early secondary arrest it is necessary to take into consideration the patient's parity. Multipara making little progress at 4 cm of dilatation most likely will be in latent phase. A nullipara under the same circumstances most likely will be in early secondary arrest. The degree of cervical dilatation is also important. 60% of the patient will be in active phase if the cervix is 4 cm dilated and 90% if it is 5 cm. Finally cervical effacement is a good criterion for recognizing patients in active phase. Most patients will be in active phase if their cervix is dilated 3 cm or more and 100% effaced. If effacement is 50% or less most likely they are in latent phase. Management. There are two modes of management for patients with prolonged latent phase. Therapeutic rest. Oxytocin stimulation.",
