One impoant maneuver when encountering fetal heart rate abnormalities is a positional change, such as the lateral decubitus position. Oxytocin and epidural anesthesia both can decrease oxygen delivery to the placental bed. Oxytocin may hyperstimulate the uterus and cause frequent contractions; this then results in frequent vasoconstriction of the uterine vessels which decreases the amount of blood arriving to the placenta and fetus over time. Thus, stopping the oxytocin may help improve oxygenation. An epidural can cause hypotension in the mother which may then lead to fetal bradycardia by also decreasing the amount of blood profusing the fetus per given time. Morphine sulfate can cause respiratory depression in the fetus, so it would not be a method of choice for increasing delivery of oxygen to the fetus.",

Each lies in the free upper border of the broad ligament and, when straightened, is 10 cm in length. Its lumen communicates with the uterine cavity at its inner end and with the peritoneal cavity at its outer and thus provides the final section of an open or potentially open canal which leads from the exterior to the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tube is divided into four pas Interstitial or Intramural Pa This is only 1-2 cm in length and is the pa which traverses the uterine wall. It has a very narrow lumen (1 mm in diameter) and is different from the remainder of the tube in that it is without a peritoneal coat, and in that the outer longitudinal muscle has disappeared to cover the uterus. Isthmus This is the straight and narrow poion adjacent to the uterus and measures 2-3 cm. It has thick walls but the lumen is so narrow that it will only admit the finest probe (1-2 mm in diameter). Ampulla This is the wider, thin-walled and touous outer poion, approximately 5 cm in length, which leads to the infundibulum. Infundibulum This is the trumpet-shaped outer end with an opening into the peritoneal cavity (abdominal ostium). The latter is surrounded by fronds or fimbriae, one of which is longer than the others and is directed towards the ovary (fimbria ovarica). The fimbriated extremity is free of the broad ligament and curls back on itself so that its fimbriae aim to embrace the ovary like the tentacles of an octopus; this is impoant to feility. jeffcoate&; s principles of gynaceology; 7th edition; pageno 29",

The Mc. Robes maneuver and application of suprapubic pressure are two techniques that attempt to relieve the impaction of the anterior shoulder. Unlike gestational diabetes, the complication with hydrocephalus is that the fetal head is greater than the body. The head itself may have a difficult time passing through the pelvis, but if it does pass, the shoulders would have no problem passing through since their width would be smaller than the width of the fetal head. The pre-mature fetus typically has a well-propoioned body, but is overall smaller in size than the average-sized baby. No pa of a premature fetus body should typically get impacted anywhere along the bih canal. With precipitous labor, there is a decreased chance that a shoulder dystocia will occur, whereas a prolonged second stage of labor should raise suspicion that a dystocia is present.",
