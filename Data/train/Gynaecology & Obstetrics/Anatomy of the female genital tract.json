One impoant maneuver when encountering fetal heart rate abnormalities is a positional change, such as the lateral decubitus position. Oxytocin and epidural anesthesia both can decrease oxygen delivery to the placental bed. Oxytocin may hyperstimulate the uterus and cause frequent contractions; this then results in frequent vasoconstriction of the uterine vessels which decreases the amount of blood arriving to the placenta and fetus over time. Thus, stopping the oxytocin may help improve oxygenation. An epidural can cause hypotension in the mother which may then lead to fetal bradycardia by also decreasing the amount of blood profusing the fetus per given time. Morphine sulfate can cause respiratory depression in the fetus, so it would not be a method of choice for increasing delivery of oxygen to the fetus.",

The Mc. Robes maneuver and application of suprapubic pressure are two techniques that attempt to relieve the impaction of the anterior shoulder. Unlike gestational diabetes, the complication with hydrocephalus is that the fetal head is greater than the body. The head itself may have a difficult time passing through the pelvis, but if it does pass, the shoulders would have no problem passing through since their width would be smaller than the width of the fetal head. The pre-mature fetus typically has a well-propoioned body, but is overall smaller in size than the average-sized baby. No pa of a premature fetus body should typically get impacted anywhere along the bih canal.
