Occurs in monochorionic diamniotic twin gestation resulting from unidirectional flow through deep arteriovenous anastomoses in the shared placenta. In this syndrome blood is transfused from a donor twin to its recipient sibling such that the donor may eventually become anemic and its growth may be restricted. In contrast, the recipient becomes plethoric, develop circulatory overload manifest as hydrops, polycythemic, may develop hyperviscosity and Occlusive thrombosis is another concern. Finally, polycythemia in the recipient twin may lead to severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus. TTTS is diagnosed based on two criteria:(1) presence of a monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy(2) hydramnios defined if the largest vertical pocket is 8cm in one twin and oligohydramnios defined if the largest vertical pocket is 2cm in the other twin. TTTS is typically staged by the Quintero (1999) staging system: Stage I--urine is still visible sonographically within the bladder of the donor twin. Stage II--criteria of stage I, but urine is not visible within the donor bladder. Stage III--criteria of stage II and abnormal Doppler studies of the umbilical artery, ductus venosus, or umbilical vein. Stage IV--ascites or frank hydrops in either twin. Stage V--demise of either fetus. Treatment - laser ablation of the vascular anastomoses",

Hereditary: There is hereditary predisposition likely to be more transmitted through the female (maternal side). Advancing age of the mother: Increased incidence of twinning is observed with the advancing age of the mother, the maximum being between the age of 30-35 years. The incidence of twins is markedly reduced thereafter. Influence of parity: The incidence is increased with increasing parity specially from 5th gravida onwards. Iatrogenic: Drugs used for induction of ovulation may produce multiple fetuses to the extent of 20-40% following gonadotrophin therapy, although to a lesser extent (5-6%) following clomiphene citrate. Dizygotic twins: There are two placentae, either completely separated or more commonly fused at the margin appearing to be one (9 out of 10). There is no anastomosis between the two fetal vessels. Each fetus is surrounded by a separate amnion & chorion. As such, intervening membranes consist of 4 layers - amnion, chorion, chorion & amnion. In fact in early pregnancy the decidua capsularis of each sac may be identified under the microscope in between the chorionic layers. Other Options[?]. Monozygotic twins: The placenta is single.

Conjoined twins (Siamese twins--incidence, 1/50, 000) probably result from relatively late monovular separation, as does the presence of two separate embryos in one amniotic sac. The latter condition has a high fatality rate that is due to obstruction of the circulation secondary to intertwining of the umbilical cords. The prognosis for conjoined twins depends on the possibility of surgical separation, which in turn depends on the degree that vital organs are shared. The site of connections varies: thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of conjoined twins), thoracopagus (18%), omphalopagus (10%), craniopagus (6%), and incomplete duplication (10%). Difficult to separate conjoined twins have occasionally survived to adulthood. Most conjoined twins are female. Superfecundation, or fertilization of an ovum by an insemination that takes place after one ovum has already been fertilized, and superfetation, or fertilization and subsequent development of an ovum when a fetus is already present in the uterus, have been proposed as uncommon explanations for differences in size and appearance of certain twins at birth. A prenatal diagnosis of pregnancy with twins is suggested by a uterine size that is greater than that expected for gestational age, auscultation of two fetal hearts, and elevated maternal serum a-fetoprotein or human chorionic gonadotropin levels, and it is confirmed by ultrasound. Ninety per cent of twins are detected before delivery.",
