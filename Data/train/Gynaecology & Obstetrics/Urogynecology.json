In a case of complete transection urinary diversion by nephrostomy is advisable to tide over the crisis, followed later with repair surgery. In case the transection is recognised during the surgery, the surgeon must undeake anastamosis at the site of injury or implant the cut end of the ureter into the bladder or perform a Boari flap operation of Ureteroneocystostomy.

The management of urge incontinence includes bladder training, biofeedback, or medical therapy. Treatment with anticholinergic drugs (oxybutynin chloride), b-sympathomimetic agonists (metaproterenol sulfate), Valium, antidepressants (imipramine hydrochloride), and dopamine agonists (Parlodel) has been successful.
