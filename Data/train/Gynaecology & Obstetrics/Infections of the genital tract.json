Diagnosis A fishy vaginal odor, which is paicularly noticeable following coitus, and vaginal discharge are present. Vaginal secretions are gray and thinly coat the vaginal walls. The pH of these secretions is higher than 4. 5 (usually 4. 7 to 5. 7). Microscopy of the vaginal secretions reveals an increased number of clue cells, and leukocytes are conspicuously absent. In advanced cases of BV, more than 20% of the epithelial cells are clue cells. The addition of KOH to the vaginal secretions (the \"whiff\" test) releases a fishy, amine-like odor. Treatment Metronidazole, an antibiotic with excellent activity against anaerobes but poor activity against lactobacilli, is the drug of choice for the treatment of BV. A dose of 500 mg administered orally twice a day for 7 days should be used. Ref: Berek and Novak's Gynecology; 15th edition; Chapter 18",

Treatment modalities: Medical treatment, antimicrobial Minimal invasive surgery Major surgery Management: Rest Intravenous fluids in the presence of dehydration or vomiting and correction of electrolyte imbalance Analgesics, once the diganosis is confirmed Antibiotics- Because of the damaging effect of gonococci and Chlamydia on the fallopian tubes and poly microbial nature of infection, it is mandatory to institute antibiotic therapy at the earliest and not wait for the culture results. First-line therapies: Cefoxitin (2 gm intravenously every 6 hours) or cefotetan (2gm IV every 12 hours) plus doxycycline (100mg orally every 12 hours) Because of the pain associated with intravenous infusion, doxycycline should be administered orally when possible. Oral and IV administration of doxycycline provide similar bioavailability. Placentrex (aqeous extract of thr fresh placenta) 1 ml intramuscularly daily or alternate days (total of 10 injections) has multipronged anti-inflammatory action. It also causes tissue regeneration, wound healing, and has significant immunotropic action involving both humoral and cellular immunity however it is outdated and not used currently. Paner should be investigated and treated There is no need to remove IUCD if the woman responds to antibiotics; failed response calls for its removal. Percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD) under CT/Ultrasound guidance of abdominal mass and pyoperitoneum yields 50% success and reduces the need for major surgery, with its associated moality and morbidity.

Genital Tuberculosis: Female genital tuberculosis is an impoant cause of significant morbidity, sho and long-term sequelae especially infeility. Genital tuberculosis usually occurs secondary to pulmonary (commonest) or Extrapulmonary TB like gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, skeleta; system, meninges, and miliary TB. However, Primary genital TB can rarely occur in women whose male paners have active genitourinary TB (e. g., tuberculosis epididymis) by transmission through infected semen Most common site involved in secondary genital TB is Fallopian tube (90-100%) > Endometrium (50-80%) > Ovaries (20-30%) > Cervix (5-15%) > Vulva The most common symptom of genital TB is infeility Causes of infeility in Genital TB: Tubal blockage If tubes are patent, then also infeility occurs due to loss of tubal function Tubercular endometritis causes uterine scarring resulting in the destruction of the endometrium Ovarian damage with poor ovarian reserve and volume Hematogenous spread is thought to be the process by which the tubercle bacillii implant into the mucosa of the fallopian tubes and subsequently affect the endometrium by direct extension. A laparoscopy and dye hydrotubation (lap and dye test) is the most reliable tool to diagnose genital TB, especially for the tubal, ovarian and peritoneal disease. The test can be combined with hysteroscopy. Multiple drug therapy (ATT regimen provided by DOTS) in adequate doses and for sufficient duration is the mainstay in the treatment of TB including genital tuberculosis.
