        "exp": "Ans. c. Mullerian agenesis (Ref: Shows 14/e p81-83)A 16 years old female with normal pubic hairs and breast presented with primary amenorrhea, with blind vagina and absent uterus. Diagnosis in this case is Mullerian agenesis. Evaluation of Primary Amenorrhea: Primary amenorrhea is evaluated most efficiently by focusing on the presence or absence of: 1. Breast Development: It is a marker of estrogen action and therefore function of the ovary2. Presence or absence of uterus: As determined by ultrasound or in more complex cases by MRIEvaluation of Primary Amenorrhea. Breast Development: Breast development and other secondary sexual characters are markers of estrogen action and therefore function of the ovary. Presence of breast and other secondary sexual features indicate normal estrogen level and normally functioning ovary. Absence of Breast: Absence of breast indicates reduced estrogen level. The cause of reduced estrogen level is then determined by measuring FSHIncreased serum FSH and absent breast indicates primary ovarian failure. This is mostly caused by 'Gondal Dysgenesis' (Turner's syndrome). Elevated FSH is due to absence of ovarian oocytes and follicles leading to reduction in negative feedback on FSH from estradiol and inhibins A and B. Absent breast with decreased serum FSH indicates primary amenorrhea due to hypothalamic or pituitary causes. Presence or absence of uterus. Further testing for a women with primary amenorrhea depends upon the findings on physical examination in particular whether mullerian structures are present or absent (Mullerian structures: Cervix, uterus, vagina, ovarian tube). The single most important step in the evaluation of primary amenorrhea depends upon the findings on physical examination or ultrasonography, whether there are any anatomic abnormalities of the vagina, cervix or uterus. Absence of Uterus: Absence of uterus usually means that Mullerian inhibitory substance was secreted at the time of Wolffian duct development. Mullerian inhibiting substance is usually secreted from the sertoli cells of the testis and it inhibits the development. Wolffian duct or Mullerian duct structures. Absence of uterus suggests presence of MIS and is likely evidence of the presence of testis. For those with absence of the uterus, further evaluation should include a karyotype measurement and measurement of serum testosterone. These tests allow the clinician to distinguish between abnormal Mullerian development and androgen insensitivity syndrome. Absence of Uterus: For patients with normal Mullerian structures and no evidence of an imperforate hymen, vaginal septum, or congenital absence of vagina, an endocrine evaluation should be performed. This includes measurement of serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin to exclude pregnancy and of serum FSH and other hormones. A high serum FSH concentration is indicative of primary ovarian failure. A karyotype is then required to detect the presence of Turner's syndrome. Turner's syndrome is characterized by the complete or partial deletion of X chromosome. In addition, evaluation for other diseases associated with specific type of ovarian failure should be performed. Low or normal FSH suggests functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, congenital Gn. PH deficiency or other disorders of hypothalamic pituitary axis. Serum prolactin is measured if galactorrhoea is present. If there are signs of hyperandrogenism, serum ketosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) should be measured.",

        "exp": "Ans. a (Kallman's syndrome) (Ref. H -18th/Ch. 339). Kallmann syndrome results from defective hypothalamic Gn. RH synthesis and is associated with anosmia or hyposmia due to olfactory bulb agenesis or hypoplasia. The syndrome also may be associated with color blindness, optic atrophy, nerve deafness, cleft palate, renal abnormalities, cryptorchidism, and neurologic abnormalities such as mirror movements. Defects in the X-linked KAL gene impair embryonic migration of Gn. RH neurons from the hypothalamic olfactory placode to the hypothalamus. Autosomal recessive (i. e., GPR54, K1. SS1) and dominant (i. e., FGFR1) modes of transmission have been described. Males present with delayed puberty and pronounced hypogonadal features, including micropenis, probably the result of low testosterone levels during infancy. Females present with primary amenorrhea and failure of secondary sexual development. Kallmann syndrome and other causes of congenital Gn. RH deficiency are characterized by low LH and FSH levels and low concentrations of sex steroids (testosterone or estradiol). Long-term Rx of men with h. CG or testosterone restores pubertal development and secondary sex characteristics; women can be treated with cyclic estrogen and progestin. Fertility also may be restored by the administration of gonadotropins or by using a infusion pump to deliver subcutaneous, pulsatile Gn. RH. Kallmann's syndromeis an X-linked disorder characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is associated with anosmia. It more commonly affects men than women. Mc. Cune-Albright syndromeis characterized by patchy cutaneous hyperpigmentation, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and several endocrine disorders including toxic multinodular goiter. Testicular feminization syndrome (complete androgen insensitivity syndrome)A genetic disorder that makes XY fetuses insensitive to androgens (male hormones).

        "question": "Androgen insensitivity syndrome true is:",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Phenotype may be completely female Androgen Insensitivity syndrome (Testicular feminization syndrome). The characteristic features of these disorders are that they are genotypically male (XY) while phenotypically they are female. These cases usually present as female with abdominal testis. Prepubertal children with this disorder are often detected when inguinal masses prove to be a testis or when a testis is unexpectedly found during herniorrhaphy in phenotypically female. It is called testicular feminization syndrome but the name is both stigmatizing and inaccurate {the testes do not produce feminizing factors). The preferred name, complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) reflects the underlying aetiology. The cause of androgen insensitivity syndrome is the abnormality of the and Rosen receptor. In the fetus with CAIS testes forms normally due to the presence of the (SRY gene) on chromosome Y. At the appropriate time, these testes secretes anti Mullerian hormone leading to the regression of mullerian ducts. Hence CAIS 'women' do not have a uterus. Testosterone is also produced at the appropriate time. However due to the complete inability of the androgen receptor to respond, the external genitalia do not Virilize and instead undergo female development. These patients have vagina instead of penis. Other areas where testosterone may have important fetal effects, such as the brain, will also develop along the female path. The result is a female (both physically and psychologically) with no uterus, testis present which is found at some point in their line of descent through the abdomen from the pelvis to the inguinal canal. During puberty, breast development will be normal,; however, the effects of androgens will not be seen, so pubic and axillary hair growth will be minimal. Majority of women with CAIS have shortened vagina, when compared with normal average length of 10-12 cm. The cause of this lies in the embryological development of the vagina, - Upper portion of vagina - develops from mullerian ducts- Lower portion of vagina - develops from urogenital sinus. In CAIS mullerian duct regresses, under the effect of mullerian inhibiting hormone, leaving just the part derived from the urogenital sinus. Clinical features of CAIS Female external genitalia46 xy karyotype. Intraabdominal or inguinal testes. Absent uterus. Primary amenorrhoea. Reduced or absent sexual hair (pubic and axillary).

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e. Turner's syndrome Swyer syndrome (Pure gonadal dysgenesis). Patients with pure gonadal dysgenesis have XY karyotype. In these cases primitive germ cells do not migrate to the genital ridge so testis will not develop instead, the patients have streak gonads. Normal testis secretes Mullerian inhibiting factor and Testosterone. Thus in these cases there is absence of mullerian inhibiting factor and Testosterone. So these patients have normal female internal and external genitalia. Absence of MIF causes - Development of mullerian structures i. e. uterus, Fallopian tube. Absence of testosterone stops the development of - wool lian duct structures i. e. seminal vesicle, prostate. These individuals are not able to produce any estrogen so they will not develop breast Mayor Rokitansky Kuster Hauser syndrome: This is also known as Mullerian agenesis syndrome. In these cases patient does not develop mullerian structures i. e. uterus, Fallopian tube and upper portion of vagina. The breast development is normal in these patients. Mixed Gonadal dysgenesis. Mixed gonadal dysgenesis is a type of asymmetrical gonadal dysgenesis (one side is more developed than the other). In most of the cases there is a unilateral testis usually intraabdominal and a streak gonad on the contralateral side. Functionally the gonads are incompetent i. e. they. Failed to completely inhibit mullerian development. Failed to support full differentiation of mesonephric duct structures. Failed to adequately masculinize development of external genitalia. Often fail to mediate their own descent, resulting in asymmetry of internal and external genitalis. The mullerian structures are present since no anti mullerian hormones are produced. The patient has normal uterus usually B/L fallopian tubes. The external genitalia are always masculinized. The breast is not developed. Turner's syndrome. In Turner's syndrome the gonads are not properly developed (streak gonads). The ovary is not properly developed and it cannot secrete adequate amount of estrogen. This leads to lack of secondary sexual characteristic. Breast is not developed properly. Uterus is not developed properly in most of the patients who have not received estrogen therapy.
