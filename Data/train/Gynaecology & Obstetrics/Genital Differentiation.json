        "exp": "Ans. c. Mullerian agenesis (Ref: Shows 14/e p81-83)A 16 years old female with normal pubic hairs and breast presented with primary amenorrhea, with blind vagina and absent uterus. Diagnosis in this case is Mullerian agenesis. Evaluation of Primary Amenorrhea: Primary amenorrhea is evaluated most efficiently by focusing on the presence or absence of: 1. Breast Development: It is a marker of estrogen action and therefore function of the ovary2. Presence or absence of uterus: As determined by ultrasound or in more complex cases by MRIEvaluation of Primary Amenorrhea. Breast Development: Breast development and other secondary sexual characters are markers of estrogen action and therefore function of the ovary. Presence of breast and other secondary sexual features indicate normal estrogen level and normally functioning ovary. Absence of Breast: Absence of breast indicates reduced estrogen level. The cause of reduced estrogen level is then determined by measuring FSHIncreased serum FSH and absent breast indicates primary ovarian failure. This is mostly caused by 'Gondal Dysgenesis' (Turner's syndrome). Elevated FSH is due to absence of ovarian oocytes and follicles leading to reduction in negative feedback on FSH from estradiol and inhibins A and B. Absent breast with decreased serum FSH indicates primary amenorrhea due to hypothalamic or pituitary causes. Presence or absence of uterus. Further testing for a women with primary amenorrhea depends upon the findings on physical examination in particular whether mullerian structures are present or absent (Mullerian structures: Cervix, uterus, vagina, ovarian tube). The single most important step in the evaluation of primary amenorrhea depends upon the findings on physical examination or ultrasonography, whether there are any anatomic abnormalities of the vagina, cervix or uterus. Absence of Uterus: Absence of uterus usually means that Mullerian inhibitory substance was secreted at the time of Wolffian duct development. Mullerian inhibiting substance is usually secreted from the sertoli cells of the testis and it inhibits the development. Wolffian duct or Mullerian duct structures. Absence of uterus suggests presence of MIS and is likely evidence of the presence of testis. For those with absence of the uterus, further evaluation should include a karyotype measurement and measurement of serum testosterone. These tests allow the clinician to distinguish between abnormal Mullerian development and androgen insensitivity syndrome. Absence of Uterus: For patients with normal Mullerian structures and no evidence of an imperforate hymen, vaginal septum, or congenital absence of vagina, an endocrine evaluation should be performed. This includes measurement of serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin to exclude pregnancy and of serum FSH and other hormones. A high serum FSH concentration is indicative of primary ovarian failure. A karyotype is then required to detect the presence of Turner's syndrome. Turner's syndrome is characterized by the complete or partial deletion of X chromosome. In addition, evaluation for other diseases associated with specific type of ovarian failure should be performed. Low or normal FSH suggests functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, congenital Gn. PH deficiency or other disorders of hypothalamic pituitary axis. Serum prolactin is measured if galactorrhoea is present. If there are signs of hyperandrogenism, serum ketosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) should be measured.",

Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), formerly known as testicular feminization, is an X-linked recessive condition resulting in a failure of normal masculinization of the external genitalia in chromosomally male individuals. Most cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) are identified in the newborn period by the presence of inguinal masses, which later are identified as testes during surgery.

        "question": "10 year old girl with primary amenorrhoea, absent breasts, malformed uterus. The most likely diagnosis:",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e. Turner's syndrome Swyer syndrome (Pure gonadal dysgenesis). Patients with pure gonadal dysgenesis have XY karyotype. In these cases primitive germ cells do not migrate to the genital ridge so testis will not develop instead, the patients have streak gonads. Normal testis secretes Mullerian inhibiting factor and Testosterone. Thus in these cases there is absence of mullerian inhibiting factor and Testosterone. So these patients have normal female internal and external genitalia. Absence of MIF causes - Development of mullerian structures i. e. uterus, Fallopian tube. Absence of testosterone stops the development of - wool lian duct structures i. e. seminal vesicle, prostate. These individuals are not able to produce any estrogen so they will not develop breast Mayor Rokitansky Kuster Hauser syndrome: This is also known as Mullerian agenesis syndrome. In these cases patient does not develop mullerian structures i. e. uterus, Fallopian tube and upper portion of vagina. The breast development is normal in these patients. Mixed Gonadal dysgenesis. Mixed gonadal dysgenesis is a type of asymmetrical gonadal dysgenesis (one side is more developed than the other). In most of the cases there is a unilateral testis usually intraabdominal and a streak gonad on the contralateral side. Functionally the gonads are incompetent i. e. they. Failed to completely inhibit mullerian development. Failed to support full differentiation of mesonephric duct structures. Failed to adequately masculinize development of external genitalia. Often fail to mediate their own descent, resulting in asymmetry of internal and external genitalis. The mullerian structures are present since no anti mullerian hormones are produced. The patient has normal uterus usually B/L fallopian tubes. The external genitalia are always masculinized. The breast is not developed. Turner's syndrome. In Turner's syndrome the gonads are not properly developed (streak gonads). The ovary is not properly developed and it cannot secrete adequate amount of estrogen. This leads to lack of secondary sexual characteristic. Breast is not developed properly. Uterus is not developed properly in most of the patients who have not received estrogen therapy.
