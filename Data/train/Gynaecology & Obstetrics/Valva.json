VulvaRef: Shaw's Textbook of Gynecology 16th Ed; Page No-475A variety of developmental, trophic, inflammatory, allergic and neoplastic disorders can occur in the vulvar skin and its appendages. The common vulvar disorders affecting its various constituents are:Epidermis and dermis: Common dermatological disorders, allergies, infections, naevi, dystrophies, ulcers and new growths.Skin appendages. Folliculitis, sebaceous cysts, hidradenomas, Bartholin's cyst or abscess and Paget's disease.Adjacent structures: Lipomas, fibromas, haemangiomas, varicosities, carcinomas, sarcomas and endometriosis.Developmental: Vulvovaginal cysts, intact hymen, vulval anus and intersex problems.Hormonal: Vulval atrophy in menopausal women.CANCER OFTHEVULVACancer of the vulva is a rare entity and accounts for 1-5% of all genital cancers.In developing countries, incidence is 50% lower.Malignant tumours of the vulva are grouped as follows:Pre-invasive lesions--intraepithelial cancer VIN I, II, IIIBowen disease }Intraepithelial carcinomasPaeet's diseaseMicroinvasiveMelanoma in situInvasive lesionsSquamous cell carcinoma--Most common 90%Melanoma 1-5%Adenocarcinoma 1%Sarcoma 2%Rodent ulcer or basal cell carcinoma 1%.The vulva can also occasionally be the site of metastatic cancer. Cancer of the vulva and the cervix may coexist in case it is caused by papilloma virus. Most of these malignant lesions are located on the labia majora. In 5%, the lesions are multifocal, and are seen in younger women below 40 years.",
