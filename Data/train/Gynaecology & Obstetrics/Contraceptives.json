        "exp": "There are two methods of describing the effectiveness of contraceptive agents: the theoretical or method effectiveness rate and the actual use effectiveness rate. When comparing different methods, it is important to use comparable figures. The effectiveness of the rhythm method is influenced by the woman's ability to predict the time of ovulation from the regularity of her menses, and by her motivation to successfully abstain from intercourse during the 10 days around suspected ovulation. The menstrual and ovulatory irregularities and lapses in the woman's motivation account for a pregnancy rate of 40% with the rhythm method. In contrast to the rhythm method, the IUD requires little or no action on the part of the woman. For this reason the device's actual use effectiveness approaches its maximal theoretical effectiveness, with a pregnancy rate of 3 to 10%. Unrecognized expulsion or misplaced insertion of the IUD are responsible for most failures. The vaginal diaphragm and the condom are barrier contraceptives in that for each act of sexual intercourse they pose a barrier between the sperm ejaculate and the endocervical canal. In theory, both can be very effective. However, both require recurrent motivation for application with each act of intercourse. Lapses in motivation are not uncommon, and there is a pregnancy rate of 15 to 25% for each of these two methods. The condom used with a spermicidal agent is very effective, more so than either used alone. The pregnancy rate with postcoital douching is almost the same as that for unprotected intercourse (80%). This lack of effectiveness is readily explained by the extremely rapid progression of motile sperm into the endocervical canal. Within several minutes of coitus, sperm have ascended the female reproductive tract and can be found within the endocervical mucus, uterus, and fallopian tubes. Coupled with the failure of a vaginal douche to reach the endocervix, this method is essentially useless. Combined oral contraceptive birth control pills are clearly the most effective reversible contraceptive currently available. With correct use, many studies report a contraceptive effectiveness that approaches 100% (pregnancy rate less than 0. 1%). This extreme effectiveness is best explained by the pill's multiplicity of actions, i. e., suppression of ovulation, hostility of cervical mucus to sperm penetration, and hostility of atrophic endometrium to the implantation of a conceptus. Failure to take the pills regularly is responsible for most failures, and in practice pregnancy rates of at least 5% are common.",

If the pill is properly used, the failure rate for users is the lowest among women using a reversible method of contraception. However, the use of oral contraceptives is contraindicated in patients with a history of thrombophlebitis. Both condoms and the diaphragm, used in conjunction with spermicides, are effective contraceptives that are also effective in preventing sexually transmitted diseases and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The diaphragm should carefully fit in the vagina and is therefore not applicable to women with anatomic distortion of the vagina. Latex condoms should not be used in women with a known latex allergy. IUDs are associated with increased risk of salpingitis and ectopic pregnancy, and therefore should be avoided in patients with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), multiple sexual partners, or ectopic conception. Although tubal ligation may be considered in the patient with chronic obstructive lung disease, the risk of general anesthesia and surgical intervention in this patient is probably high enough to indicate a more conservative approach, such as the use of an IUD.",

Because lower genital tract infection are on the rise (now the most prevalent STI in the US) and the rate of hospitalization for PID is also increased, it is worthwhile for both patients and clinicians to be alert for symptoms of cervicitis or salpingitis in women on oral contraceptives who are at high risk of sexually transmitted infections. \" - Ref: Leon Speroff 7th/ed, p905. As far as HPV infection i. e. Vaginal warts is concerned'The viral sexually transmitted infections (STI's) include HIV, human papilloma virus (HPV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and hepatitis B (HBV). At the present time, no known associations exist between oral contraception and the viral STI'S' - Ref: Leon Speroff 7th/ed, p904. So, now we can be sure that the answer is Chlamydial endocervicitis. Also know: Infections and Oral contraception: Use of OCP is associated with. Increased risk of infection. Decreased risk of infection. No association with* Candida (Moniliasis)* Chlamydia* Urinary tract infections* GonorrheaQ* TrichomonasQ* Bacterial vaginosis* Viral STI's i. e. HIVQ, HPVQ* Hepatitis B virus* Herpes simplex virus. Note:* If question says PID and does not specify any organism -- Then OCP'S overall not only decrease the incidence of PID but also risk of hospitalization and severity of the disease is decreased.* For protection against PID, at least 12 months of continuous use is necessary and this protection is limited only to current users.",

        "exp": "The marked effectiveness of the combined oral contraceptive pill, which contains a synthetic estrogen and a progestin, is related to its multiple antifertility actions. The primary effect is to suppress gonadotropins at the time of the midcycle LH surge, thus inhibiting ovulation. The prolonged progestational effect also causes thickening of the cervical mucus and atrophic (not hyperplastic) changes of the endometrium, thus impairing sperm penetrability and ovum implantation, respectively. Progestational agents in oral contraceptives work by a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit the secretion of LH and, as a result, prevent ovulation. They also cause decidualization and atrophy of the endometrium, thereby making implantation impossible. In addition, the cervical mucus, which at ovulation is thin and watery, is changed by the influence of progestational agents to a tenacious compound that severely limits sperm motility. Some evidence indicates that progestational agents may change ovum and sperm migration patterns within the reproductive system. Progestins do not prevent irregular bleeding. Estrogen in birth control pills enhances the negative feedback of the progestins and stabilizes the endometrium to prevent irregular menses. Oral contraceptives have no direct effect on oocyte maturation and do not cause uterotubal obstruction.",

Although the incidence of ectopic pregnancies with an IUD was at one time thought to be increased, it is now recognized that in fact the overall incidence is unchanged. The apparent increase is the result of the dramatic decrease in intrauterine implantation without affecting ectopic implantation. Thus, while the overall probability of pregnancy is dramatically decreased, when a pregnancy does occur with an IUD in place, there is a higher probability that it will be an ectopic one. With this in mind, in the absence of signs and symptoms suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy, especially after ultrasound documentation of an intrauterine pregnancy, laparoscopy is not indicated.

If the pill is properly used, the failure rate for users is the lowest among women using a reversible method of contraception. However, the use of oral contraceptives is contraindicated in patients with a history of thrombophlebitis. Both condoms and the diaphragm, used in conjunction with spermicides, are effective contraceptives that are also effective in preventing sexually transmitted diseases and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The diaphragm should carefully fit in the vagina and is therefore not applicable to women with anatomic distortion of the vagina. Latex condoms should not be used in women with a known latex allergy. IUDs are associated with increased risk of salpingitis and ectopic pregnancy, and therefore should be avoided in patients with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), multiple sexual partners, or ectopic conception. Although tubal ligation may be considered in the patient with chronic obstructive lung disease, the risk of general anesthesia and surgical intervention in this patient is probably high enough to indicate a more conservative approach, such as the use of an IUD.",
