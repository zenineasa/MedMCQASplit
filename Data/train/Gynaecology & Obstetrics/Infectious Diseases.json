Transplacental transmission occurs: 20% before 36 weeks, over 80% of transmissions occur around the time of labor and deliveryo Vertical transmission is more in cases with preterm birth and with prolonged membrane ruptureo Risks of vertical transmission is directly related to maternal viral load (measured by HIV RN A) and inversely to maternal immune status (CD + count).o Maternal anti-retroviral therapy reduces the risk of vertical transmission by 70%.o Breastfeeding doubles the risk of maternal to child transmission (14% to 28%) of infection.Post partum care in HIV positive mother Breastfeedingo Doubles the risk of MTCT (from 14% to 28%) but where alternative forms of infant nutrition are not safe, the risks associated with breastfeeding may be acceptedo WHO recommends exclusive breast feeding in the developing countries for the first 6 monthso Exclusive replacement feeding is done only when AFASS criteria is fulfilled. o Mother is helped to make an informed choice.",

        "question": "A pregnant female in first trimester has 4 fold rise in IgG against toxoplasmosis, what does it indicate-",
        "exp": "Ans. is B. IgG is chronic IgM is acute Ref- Distinguishing of acute and chronic phases of toxoplasmosis has critical importance in pregnant women and immunocompromised patients. Some assays have been used to measure Toxoplasma specific IgM antibodies as indicators of the acute phase infection . Toxoplasma IgM antibodies can be detected for 1 year or longer in some cases, so in asymptomatic individuals with stable titers of Toxoplasma IgG antibodies, positive IgM results are not easy to interpret . The IgG avidity assay that had been started in the 1980s for diagnosis of rubella and hepatitis C is now used to distinguish between acute and chronic toxoplasmosis . This method was originally developed by Hedman et al. in Finland. It is based on dissociation of hydrogen bond between antigen and antibody with urea . High avidity (AI>=60%) means that Toxoplasma infection was acquired before 3 months ago, whereas borderline avidity (50%<AI<60%) means infection at an indeterminate period, and low avidity (AI<=50%) means that the infection was acquired within the last 3 months. According to the present study, 88.9% of patients with acute toxoplasmosis had low avidity (AI<=50%) and 92.7% of individuals with chronic infection had high avidity ranges (AI>=60%). It was suggested that Toxoplasma specific IgG avidity assay that is performed on specific IgM positive samples could diagnose acute and chronic phases of toxoplasmosis . Candolfi et al. also demonstrated that measuring of IgG avidity could differentiate between acute and chronic phases of toxoplasmosis. Our results showed that there was no significant relation between the concentration of IgG antibody and the level of AI. Therefore, the strength of links between antibody and antigen is not dependent on antibody concentration, which was confirmed by other investigators . Meanwhile, there are a converse relationship between IgM titer and levels of IgG AI in this study (P<0.05). On the other hand, Remington et al. suggested that IgG avidity ELISA test is not enough to confirm acute toxoplasmosis, and it should be done in addition to IgM ELISA test. Many investigators had mentioned the role of IgM detection as a key for diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis . One of the limitations of IgG avidity method is detection of reactivated toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients . In the present study, both IgM ELISA and IgG avidity ELISA tests together could confirm the phases of infection absolutely.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e. during labour HIV can be transmitted from an infected mother to the fetus during pregnancy, during delivery or by breastfeeding.HIV can be transmitted to the fetus as early as the first and second trimester of pregnancy.The transmission during birth (intrapartum) and the immediate period thereafter (peripartum) is considered to be the most common.In the absence of prophylactic antiretroviral therapy of the mother during pregnancy, labor and delivery and to the fetus following birth, the probability of transmission of HIV from mother to infant ranges from 15-25% in industrialized countries and 25-35% in developing countries.Higher risk of transmission is associated with high maternal viral load.Low CD4 count is also considered a risk factor.A prolonged interval between membrane rupture and delivery is another well documented risk factor for transmission.Other conditions that are potential risk factors but which have not been consistently demonstrated are:Presence of chorioamnionitis at deliverySTD's during pregnancyHard drug use during pregnancyCigarette smokingPreterm deliveryObstetrics procedures such as amniocentesis, amnioscopy fetal scalp electrodes, episiotomy.There is significant decrease in the risk of HIV transmission with elective cesarean.LSCS reduces the risk because during this procedure, the intrapartum period which accounts for significant proportion of transmission is by passed.",
