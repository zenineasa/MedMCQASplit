Isoniazid, Rifampicin and pyrazinamide and ethambutol are safe to the fetus. Standslrd 6 month regimen of 2 HRZ+4. HR should be given. Ethambutol should be added during late but not early pregnancy. The teratogenic effect of I. N. H. is not known therefore it is avoided in U. S. A. Treatment of the T. B. should not be withheld or delayed because of pregnancy. Of the many second-line antituberculous drug regimens, the aminoglycosides, streptomycin, kanamycin, amikacin and capreomycin are ototoxic to the fetus and are contraindicated during pregnancy. Tuberculosis t/t in breast feeding women. All Anti T. B. drugs are compatible with breast feeding. Full course should be given to the mother, but the baby should be watched. The infant should receive BCG vaccination and isoniazid prophylaxis. The use and recommendations of antitubercular drugs are as follows:* Azithromycin. No evidence of risk* Clarithromycin.

        "question": "During pregnancy HIV transmission occurs mostly during",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e. during labour HIV can be transmitted from an infected mother to the fetus during pregnancy, during delivery or by breastfeeding. HIV can be transmitted to the fetus as early as the first and second trimester of pregnancy. The transmission during birth (intrapartum) and the immediate period thereafter (peripartum) is considered to be the most common. In the absence of prophylactic antiretroviral therapy of the mother during pregnancy, labor and delivery and to the fetus following birth, the probability of transmission of HIV from mother to infant ranges from 15-25% in industrialized countries and 25-35% in developing countries. Higher risk of transmission is associated with high maternal viral load. Low CD4 count is also considered a risk factor. A prolonged interval between membrane rupture and delivery is another well documented risk factor for transmission. Other conditions that are potential risk factors but which have not been consistently demonstrated are: Presence of chorioamnionitis at delivery. STD's during pregnancy. Hard drug use during pregnancy. Cigarette smoking. Preterm delivery. Obstetrics procedures such as amniocentesis, amnioscopy fetal scalp electrodes, episiotomy. There is significant decrease in the risk of HIV transmission with elective cesarean. LSCS reduces the risk because during this procedure, the intrapartum period which accounts for significant proportion of transmission is by passed.",
