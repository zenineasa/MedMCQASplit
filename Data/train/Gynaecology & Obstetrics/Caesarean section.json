Also, A ca cervix will have a hard cervix, so we do a ceasarean even before the lower segment stas to form... like 34-36 weeks since the effacement of the cervix with a cancer will make it bleed a lot. And after a cesarean for ca cervix, the uterus is closed in one layer and then we quickly do a hysterectomy is most cases of ca cervix since there is progressive cancer of the cervix and hence there is no scope of saving the uterus any more !",
