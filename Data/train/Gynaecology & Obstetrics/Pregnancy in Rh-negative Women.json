Rh anti D immunoglobulin (IgG) is given to unimmunized Rh negative mothers with Rh positive fetus to prevent active immunization and formation of antibodies against fetal RBC's. The Anti D binds to antigen sites on the fetal red cells so that these cells do not mount an immune response, provided the baby is Rh negative and direct coombs test done on baby is negative. If mother's IUT is positive or fetus has positive direct coombs test, it means mother is already immunized. In such cases there is no point in giving anti D. Indications for Anti D immunoprophylaxis: First trimester. Later pregnancy. Miscarriage. Ectopic (medically or surgically managed). Hydatidiform mole. Threatened abortion. Medical or surgical MTPChorionic villus sampling. Miscarriage. Amniocentesis. Fetal blood sampling. Antepartum hemorrhage. External cephalic version. Routine antepartum prophylaxis. Delivery. Intrauterine fetal death. Manual removal of placenta. Note: As far as intrauterine fetal transfusion is concerned. It is done as a therapy in case Rh isoimmunization has occurred prior to 34 weeks so, administration of anti-D at this stage will not help. Dose: Ideally amount of Anti D should be calculated according to the volume of fetomaternal bleed by doing a Kleihauer test. Generally:-Gestational age <12 weeks - dose is 50 mg-Beyond 12 weeks - dose is 300 mcg. Antepartum prophylaxis: At 28 weeks gestation in a Rh negative patient: Indirect coombs test is done and if antibodies are not detected i. e. patient is unimmunised, Anti D 300 mg is given as antepartum prophylaxis. 300 mg of Anti D will neutralize about 15 mL of fetal RBC.",
