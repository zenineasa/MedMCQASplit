If the sonography demonstrates live intrauterine fetus then ectopic pregnancy is extremely unlikely. Alternatively if the uterus is empty, an ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed based on the visualization of an adnexal mass separate from the ovaries. 3-h. CG hormones also play an impoant role in the diagnosis of pregnancy. fi HCG is a hormone secreted during pregnancy. It is positive in viually 100% of ectopic pregnancies. However, a positive test only confirms pregnancy and does not indicate whether it is intrauterine or extrauterine. In normal pregnancy p. HCG should double up every 2 days but in ectopic pregnancy the rate of increase of fl h. CG is slow. 13 h. CG litres and ultrasound complement one another in detecting ectopic pregnancy and have led to earlier detection. By correlating fl h. CG titres with ultrasound. findings an ectopic pregnancy can often be differentiated. from intrauterine pregnancy. An intrauterine sac should be visible by transvaginal ultrasound when the p h. CG is approximately 1000 ml p/m1 and by transabdominal ultrasound approximately 1 week later when the fi h. CG is 1800-3600? nip/int. Thus when an empty uterine cavity is seen with a 13 h. CG litre above this threshold, the patient is likely to have an ectopic pregnancy. An empty cavity is less of a concern when a fih. CG below this threshold is obtained. Serum progesterone measuremen A single measurement of serum progesterone may sometimes clarify the diagnosis when ectopic pregnancy is suspected, but Its accuracy is crude and the customary thresholds are < 5 ng/m and > 25 'tend. i. e. a value exceeding 25 ng/m1 excludes ectopic pregnancy with 97. 5% sensitivity, value below 5 ng/ml occur in only. 3 percent of normal regnancies. So normal pregnancies can be excluded if the progesterone level is below 5%. Surgical diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy:- Laparoscopy Direct visualization of the, fallopian tubes and pelvis by diagnostic laparoscopy offers a reliable diagnosis in most cases of suspected ectopic pregnancy and a ready transition to definitive operative therapy. At times, identification of an early unruptured tubal pregnancy may be difficult even if the tube is. fully visualized. Inspite of the low morbidity and quick recovery time, laparoscopy usually is performed when, on the basis of noninvasive test or curettage results, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is fairly ceain and medical therapy is not planned. In these cases laporoscopy is used both for therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. Laparotomy Open abdominal surgery is preferred when the woman is hemodynamically unstable or when laparoscopy is not feasible. Laparotomy should not be delayed while laparoscopy is performed in a woman with obvious abdominal hemorrhage that required immediate definitive treatment. Culdocentesis Culdocentesis is the transvaginal passage of a needle into the posterior cul-de-sac in order to determine whether free blood is present in the abdomen. This procedure is useful in the diagnosis of intraperitoneal bleeding. This procedure will reveal nonclotting blood if intra-abdominal bleeding has occurred. If culdocentesis is positive, laparoscopy or laparotomy should be performed immediately. Indeed, some argue that the main purpose of culdocentesis is, not in diagnosis but to better prioritize patients so that those with positive culdocentensis are taken immediately to the operating room. More on imaging procedures used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy Vaginal sonography There has been much improvement in the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy using vaginal sonography. Its use results in earlier and more specific diagnosis of uterine pregnancy than abdominal sonography and it has become the imaging method of choice in early pregnancy.

The defect described in the question stem is a cranial encephalocele, in which brain herniates through a defect in the skull bones. The most common site for such a herniation is the occipital bone. Small defects in the occipital bone can be treated surgically, but large defects are very problematic, paicularly if significant herniation has occurred, since the brain becomes very vulnerable to trauma and infection. Meningocele is the term used when the meninges, but not the brain or spinal cord, herniate through a defect in the bony cranium or spinal column. Myelocele is the term used when the spinal cord herniates through a defect in the spinal column. Spina bifida refers to veebral defects through which the spinal cord or meninges may herniate.

Only Nelson Paediatric throws some light on this issue: \"Pulmonary surfactant is a heterogenous mixture of phospholipids and proteins secreted into the saccular or alveolar sub-phase by the type ll pneumocytes. Its presence is first recognised in characteristic secretory organelles known as lamellar bodies as early as the 24th week of gestation. However, surfactant lipids of which the most abundant is phosphatidyicholine, are not detectable in the amniotic fluid until the 30th week of gestation, suggesting that there is a chronologic gap between surfactant synthesis and secretion. Labour probably shoens this gap because phospholipids are consistently found in the air spaces of infants born before the 30th week of gestation. \" From the above lines it is clear: Surfactant synthesis occurs in 24th week of gestation, it appear in amniotic fluid in 30th week of gestation. Since 30 weeks is not given in options, I would personally go with 32 weeks, when surfactant will absolutely be detected in amniotic fluid, whereas at 28 weeks it can detected only if preterm labour occurs.",

The commonly repoed side effects are leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow aplasia, ulcerative stomatitis, hemorrhagic enteritis, elevated liver enzymes, alopecia, pneumonitis and diarrhea. It produces cranio-facial abnormalities in the fetus though it is not teratogenic. It is better to be avoided in women who are pregnant or in those who are planning for a pregnancy in the near future. Cyclosporine is a immunosuppressant that can be safely used in pregnancy. It is used in conditions like SLE, Multiple Sclerosis and renal transplant (associated with pregnancy). The other immunosuppressants that can be used in pregnancy are cyclophosphamide, prednisone and azathioprine. As malaria is a life threatening infection in pregnancy, the benefits obtained outweighs the risks that evolve from the use of anti-malarials. Chloroquine is used both in the treatment and in the prevention of malaria in pregnancy. Pyrazinamide is used in the treatment of active tuberculosis in pregnant mothers. It is given along with isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol for a period of nine months.

        "exp": "Ans. is b i. e. To take Warfarin after delivery Friends venous thromboembolism in pregnancy, is one of those topics which we donot study in detail during undergraduation. So, I am giving in brief, all the impoant points you need to remember: Venous thromboembolism in pregnnacy: Venous thromboembolism is the leading cause of maternal deaths in developed countries. Pregnancy increases the risk of thromboembolism 6 times as all components of virchow's triad are increased. deg A. Deep vein thrombosis: Left sided DVT is more common than Right sided DVT. Clinical features: swelling / redness / pain and calf muscle tenderness and oedema. Investigations - Recommended method during pregnancy: Doppler ultrasound - Gold standard (in conditions other than pregnancy): venography Mangement: Therapeutic The treatment should be staed on clinical grounds if confirmatory tests are not available. Drug of choice - Heparin (as it doesnot cross the placenta) Initially intravenous Heparin is given with the aim to prolong APTT (activated paial thromboplastic time) by 1. 5 to 2 times the control followed by subcutaneous Heparin. Monitoring is done by APTT and platelet count (as Heparin causes Thrombocytopenia). Oral anticoagulants like Warfarin cross the placenta and cause teratogenesis therefore should be avoided in pregnancy. Treatment is continued for 6 weeks following which prophylactic subcutaneous heparin is given throughout pregnancy. Heparin is stopped just before delivery. Regional anaesthesia should be avoided at the time of delivery in patients on heparin due to the risk of hematoma formation. Heparin is restaed about 6 - 8 hours after delivery as the puerperium is the time of greatest risk for VTE. Warfarin is commenced simultaneously and thereafter monitoring is done by prothrombin time (PT). Once the prothrombin time INR is between 2 and 3, heparin can be discontinued. Usually warfarin is continued for 6 to 18 weeks and is safe for breast feeding mothers. Thromboprophylaxis: Thromboprophylaxis is considered for women who are at increased risk of thromboembolism (TE). Risk category Risk factors High risk Recurrent TE Previous TE with thrombophilia Previous TE with family history TE in current pregnancy Low risk One episode of previous TE without thrombophiiia or family history Thrombophilia without previous thrombosis Additional risk Cesarean section, obesity, grand multiparity, age above 35, pre-eclampsia, prolonged immobilization etc. High risk patients need antepaum heparin, intrapaum heparin and postpaum prophylaxis for 6 weeks. Low risk patient require intrapaum and postpaum low dose prophylaxis for 6 weeks. Well, now that you have a detailed knowledge of thromboembolism, lets have a look at the question. It says: a female with previous history of embolism becomes pregnant, what medical management should be given to her? Option 'a. i. e. Compulsory prophylaxis with warfarin at 10 weeks. It is absolutely wrong as warfarin is not given during pregnancy. Option 'b Le to take warfarin after delivery - According to William obs. 22/e, p 1077 table 47-3, 23/e, p 1028 - table 47. 6 In case of prior VTE associated with a non recurring risk factor and no known thrombophilia? During pregnancy: Only surveillance is required as per American college of chest physicians. Prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is required as per American college of obs & gynaecology (which also explains option 'd is paly correct). Postpaum: warfarin is given for 6 weeks. So, option 'b' is absolutely correct i. e. warfarin should be given in the post paum period for six weeks.",

It is usually confined to the T11-T12 dermatomes during the latent phase but eventually involves the TIO-LI dermatomes as the labour enters the the active phase. The visceral afferent fibres responsible for labour pain travel with sympathetic nerve. fibres. first to the uterine and cervical plexes then through the hypogastric and aoic plexes before entering the spinal cord with the T10-L1 nerve roots. The onset of perineal pain at the end of fist stage signals the beginning of the fetal descent and the second stage of labour. Stretching and compression of pelvic and perineal structures intensify the pain.

        "exp": "Ans. is d i. e. Prophylactic oophorectomy BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are tumour suppressor genes. BRCA-1 is located on chromosome 17 and BRCA-2 on chromosome 13. Individuals who inherit mutations of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are highly susceptible for the development of hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. The mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant. Lifetime risk of Ovarian Ca in individual with these mutation - 25% Lifetime risk of Breast Ca in individual with these mutation - 50% BRCA-1 - (20-40% life time risk of ovarian cancer). BRCA-2 - (10-20% life time risk of ovarian cancer). Men in these families have an increased risk of prostate cancer. Strategies for prevention of hereditary ovarian cancer Genetic testing for susceptibility to ovarian cancer is rapidly becoming integrated into the clinical practice of oncology. Strategies have been adopted to reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer in patient with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations. Prophylactic oophorectomy: \"The only proven way to prevent ovarian cancer is surgical oopherectomy. As another possible site of disease among these high risk patients is fallopian tube therefore should be removed. IN BRCA 1 or BRCA-2 mutation carriers, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (B50) may be performed on either completion of childbearing or at age 35. In these patients, the procedure is approximately 90% effective in preventing epithelial ovarian cancer.

If the pregnant woman in the first three months suffers from: -- German measles, (incidence of congenital defects 10 to 12%). -- Smallpox or chicken pox. -- Toxoplasmosis. -- Viral hepatitis. Any severe viral infection. If the pregnant woman is treated with drugs like thalidomide, coisone, aminopterin, antimitotic drugs, or if she consumes hallucinogens or antidepressants. Mother is treated by X-rays or radioisotopes. Insanity of the parents. Humanitarian: When pregnancy has been caused by rape. deg Social: When pregnancy has resulted from the failure of contraceptive methods in case of a marrieddeg woman, which is likely to cause serious injury to her mental health.

        "exp": "Inhibins are produced by Seoli cells in males and by granulosa cells in females. Serum inhibin levels vary widely across the menstrual cycle. During the early follicular phase, FSH stimulates the secretion of inhibin B by the granulosa cells. However, increasing levels of circulating inhibin B blunt FSH secretion later in the follicular phase. A low level of inhibin B on day 3 may indicate a declining ovarian reserve which is helpful for assessing reproductive ageing and ovarian reserve. During the luteal phase, regulation of inhibin production comes under the control of LH and switches from inhibin B to inhibin A. Inhibin B levels peak during the midluteal phase, decrease with the loss of luteal function, and remain low during the luteal-follicular transition and early follicular phase. The inverse relationship between circulating inhibin levels and FSH secretion is consistent with a negative-feedback role for inhibin in regulating FSH secretion. Ref: Hoffman B. L., Schorge J.

When they are thick, centrally located, and randomly distributed, they may be associated with preeclampsia or lupus anticoagulant. Striking enlargement of the chorionic villi is commonly seen in association with severe erythroblastosis and fetal hydrops. It also has been described in maternal diabetes, fetal congestive heart failure, and maternal-fetal syphilis.

As far as candidial (monilial) vaginitis is concerned, OCP's use increase their incidence. But for Chlamydial infections: \"Persons who use barrier contraception are less frequently infected by C. Trachomatis than those who use no contraception, and women who use oral contraceptives may have a higher incidence of cervical infection than women not using oral contraceptives\". As if replying to CGDT \"Chlamydial colonization of the cervix appears more likely in OC users than in non users, but despite this. there is a 40-50% reduction in risk for Chlamydial PID\" I then had to confirm the answer from Clinical Gynaecologic Endocrinology and Infeility 7, /e by Leon Speroff (It is the most authentic and reliable book for all problems related to Endocrinology, Contraception and Infeility) \"Fifteen of the 17 published studies repoed a positive association of oral contraception with lower Genital tract infections caused by Chlamydial cervicitis. Because lower genital tract infection are on the rise (now the most prevalent STI in the US) and the rate of hospitalization for PID is also increased, it is wohwhile for both patients and clinicians to be ale for symptoms of cervicitis or salpingitis in women on oral contraceptives who are at high risk of sexually transmitted infections. \" As far as HPV infection i. e. Vaginal was is concerned 'The viral sexually transmitted infections (STI's) include HIV, Human papilloma virus (HPV), Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and hepatitis B (HBV). At the present time, no known associations exist between oral contraception and the viral STI'S'... Leon Speroff 7/e, p 904 So, now we can be sure that the answer is Chlamydial endocervicitis. Also know: Infections and Oral contraception: Use of OCP is associated with Increased risk of infection - Candida (Moniliasis) - Gonorrheadeg - Viral STI's i. e. HIVdeg. HPVdeg - Chlamydia - Trichomonasdeg - Hepatitis B virus - Urinary tract infections - Bacterial vaginosis - Herpes simplex virus Note: If question says PID and does not specify any organism. Then OCP'S overall not only decrease the incidence of PID but also risk of hospitalisation and severity of the disease is decreased. For protection against PID, at least 12 months of continuous use is necessary and this protection is limited only to current users.",

So there is not doubt we can manage the patient medically (i. e. option d - ruled out) Expectant management as explained earlier is not better than medical management as it carries the risk of rupture of ectopic pregnancy (i. e. option C ruled out) and also it is done when ri. FICG levels are < 1000 IUL Now - The question arises whether we should give single dose MTx or multidose methotrexate treatment. In the trials which have been conducted - No difference was found in treatment duration, ph. CG levels and side effects in single dose vs multidose methotrexate therapy. Single dose therapy is more commonly used becasue of simplicity. It is less expensive, requires less invasive post therapy monitoring and does not require leucovorin supplementation. One trial has shown that multidose therapy has greater chance of success than single dose but this is not suppoed by any other trial so, single dose methotrexate is being used commonly. (So, it is our option of choice.) Also know: Single dose Medical treatment protocol for ectopic pregnancy. Day 0 / Day I = Measure serum r3h.

In transposition of the great vessels, the aoa takes off from the anterior pa of the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk takes off from the posterior pa of the left ventricle. This produces a complete separation of the systemic and pulmonary circulations. Without surgical correction, most affected infants die within the first months of life, although a patent ductus aeriosus, patent foramen ovale, or ventricular septal defect may allow enough mixing of blood to temporarily sustain life. In atrial septal defect blood can pass from one atrium to the other. Associate coarctation of the aoa with Turner syndrome.

It is essential to destroy endometrial functionalis and basalis as well as 3mm of myometrial depth. Procedure: After appropriate inspection of the landmarks and endometrial cavity, a wire loop electrode is used to resect several strips of endomyometrium, to a depth of 4mm. Resected tissue is used for pathologic examination and documentation of the absence of cellular atypia. After a few strips are resected initially from the posterior uterine wall, resection of almost all the remaining surface with loop electrode by vaporization is performed. The procedure should be performed soon after menstruation or the woman should be given progesterone, danazol or Gn. RH to suppress the endometrium. Result: Short term and long term studies show amenorrhea rates of 20-50%, overall improved bleeding patterns (including amenorrhea) in 85-95%, with failure rates of 5-10% which requires additional surgery i. e. hysterectomy. Extra Edge: \u2022 A COG recommends endometrial sampling prior to ablation surgery.

Intermittent vaginal bleeding that follows coitus i. e. post coital bleeding is a very specific symptom of cervical cancer. Now in patients suspected of having cervical cancer, management is: \"In those with suspected cervical cancer, a thorough external genital and vaginal examination should be should be performed, looking for concomitant lesions\"... Williams Gynae 1st /ed p 653 So the first step should be thorough clinical and vaginal examination. Papanicolaou Smear - \"Histologic evaluation of cervical biopsy is the primary tool used to diagnose cervical cancer. Although pap smears are performed extensively to screen for this cancer, this test does not always detect cervical cancer. Specifically, Pap smear testing has only a 55- 80% sensitivity for detecting high grade, lesions on any given single test. Thus, the preventive power of Pap smear testing lies in a regular serial screening. Moreover, in women who have stage-I cervical cancer, only 30 to 50% of single cytologic smears obtained are read as positive for cancer hence, the use of pap smear alone for evaluation of suspicious lesion is discouraged. Importantly, these lesions should be directly biopsied. \"... Williams Gynae 1st /ed p 653 This means whenever a patient comes with specific complaint like post coital bleeding pap smear is not the initial test colposcopy should directly be done. This rules out pap smear. Now read what Novaks has to say on this issue - \"When obvious tumor growth is present, a cervical biopsy is usually sufficient for diagnosis. If gross disease is not present, a colposcopic examination with cervical biopsies and endocervical curettage is warranted. If the diagnosis cannot be established conclusively with colposcopy and directed biopsies, cervical conization may be necessary. \"...

Serum FSH levels vary significantly across the cycle hence FSH is best measured during the early follicular phase ( cycle day 2-4). Basal serum estradiol concentration has little value as ovarian reserve test. AMH: Antimullerian hormone is produced from preantral and small antral follicles hence AMH levels are gonadotropin-independent and exhibit little variation within and between menstrual cycles. AMH threshold levels (0. 2-0. 7ng/ml) has 40-97% sensitivity, 70-92% specificity, 22-88% PPV and 97-100% NPV for predicting poor response to stimulation (<3 follicles or < 2-4oocytes).",

This method is based on the observation of changes in the characteristics of cervical mucus. At the time of ovulation - mucus is watery, clear (resembling raw egg white), smooth, slippery and profuse. After ovulation, under the influence of progesterone, the mucus thickens and lessens in quantity. It is recommended that women use a tissue paper to wipe inside the vagina to assess quantity and character of mucus. Intercourse is considered safe during the dry days immediately after the menses initial the mucus is detected. Thereafter the couple must abstain until the fouh day after the peak day. To practice this method, the women should be able to distinguish between different types of mucus. This requires a high degree of motivation. Other natural family planning methods are: Basal body temperature (under the influence of progesterone at the time of ovulation, BBT rises by 0. 3 -0. 5degF). Calender technique Symptothermic method - it combines BBT+ cervical mucus + calendar technique",

        "question": "Ideal contraceptive for lactating mothers is:",
        "exp": "lactational amenorrhoea An almost similar question was asked previously in 'All India' examination. Note that previously 'Most effective' contraceptive was asked. Now the question is different -Ideal' contraceptive is asked. Practically, there are no ideal contraceptives (neither for lactating women, nor for non-lactating women). An Ideal contraceptive is one which is - 100% effective, 100% safe, reversible with no side effects, and minimal effect on lactation. The Barrier methods and Combined OCPs can be easily ruled out; as barrier methods have high failure rates if used alone; while combined OCPs have a negative effect on breast milk production. Lactational amenorrhoea is the most ideal contraceptive for a lactating women, as it has viually no side effects, rather it has plethora of benefits for both mother and child. About effectiveness, it is almost equally effective to Progesterone only pills (POPs) when used perfectly. (see the below given table). Failure rates: Contraceptive method Typical use Perfect use LAM (6 months only) 2. 0 0. 5 IUD 0. 8 0. 6 POP 'mini pill' 8. 0 0. 5 Combined oral contraceptive 6-8 0. 1 Barrier method 14 3. 0 Lactational amenorrhoea (LAM) is a natural, safe and effective contraceptive method which can be used upto 6 months post paum if the following conditions are met. (Note that LAM is not pure simple exclusive breast feeding; following conditions need to be fulfilled) The mother should not experience vaginal bleeding after the 8 weeks postpaum. The baby is less than 6 months old. The baby is exclusively breastfed. Breast. feeding is done at least every 4 hrs. during the day and every 6 hrs during night. If the above conditions are fulfilled then LAM can give more than 98% protection from pregnancy. It has the added benefit of promoting exclusive breast feeding which is the ideal nutrition for infants. Lactational Amenorrhoea Advantages Disadvantages * Very effective if used perfectly * Can be used only for a sho * Has no side effects period (6 months post paum) * Promotes exclusive breast feeding, and therefore enhances maternal and infant health. * Does not require inseion of any device at the time of sexual intercourse * Can be initiated immediately postpaum * Is economical and requires no commodities or supplies * Reduces mother's lifetime risk of breast cancer. Physiology of LAM: Infant's suckling is the stimulus that initiates the state of lactational amenorrhea for breastfeeding women. The act of suckling elevates prolactin levels, and reduces Gn. RH from the hypothalamus. This reduces LH release thus inhibiting follicular maturation. This prevents ovulation. But, even with continued nursing, ovulation eventually returns after 6 months, so another method of contraception should be used 6 months postpaum, or sooner if the menses resume. Ovalation has been seen to resume even earlier in some patients, so some books advice 'Rule of 3' i. e. - another contraceptive method should be use along with LAM beginning from the 3rd postpaum month. - and if the women is paially breastfeeding or not breastfeeding, the contraceptive should begin by the 3rd postpaum week. Progesterone only pills are the most effective contraceptive during lactation amongst the options provided. They have drawbacks like: - Have to be taken regularly at the same time - Cause spotting or irregular bleeding, ectopic pregnancy, headache, nausea, acne, hirsuitism and weight gain",

Mc. Robe's maneuver; Woods' screw maneuver which leads to turning the anterior shoulder to the posterior and vice versa. Jacquemier's maneuver, or delivery of the posterior shoulder first, in which the forearm and hand are identified in the bih canal, and gently pulled. More drastic maneuvers include Zavanelli's maneuver involves pushing the fetal head back in with performing a cesarean section.

They appear as single, red, smooth elongated masses extending from the external os. Polyps vary in size and range from several millimetres to 2 or 3cm. These common growths are found more frequently in multiparas and rarely in prepubeal females. Endocervical polyps are typically asymptomatic, but they can cause metrorrhagia, postcoital bleeding and symptomatic vaginal discharge. They are usually identified by visual inspection during pelvic examination. In some instances, Pap smear findings of atypical glandular cells have been associated with endocervical polyps. Although they are typically benign, but malignant transformation may develop in 1 percent. Impoantly, cervical cancer can present as polypoid masses and can mimic these beinign lesions. For this reason removal and histologic evaluation are recommended for an endocervical polyp. Endocervical polyps are removed by grasping the polyp with a ring or polyp forceps. The polyp is twisted repeatedly about the base of its stalk to strangulate its feeding v essels. With repeated twisting the base will avulse. Monsel solution (ferric subsulfate) can be applied with direct pressure to the resulting stalk stub to complete hemostasis.",
