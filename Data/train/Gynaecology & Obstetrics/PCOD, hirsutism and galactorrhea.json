There are several limitations to their use, and there is currently no standardized assay in the United States. Moreover, most testosterone assays have poor sensitivity and accuracy in the female ranges (normal range, 20-60 ng/dl), which, even when elevated in conditions such as PCOS, tend to be well below normal male ranges (300-1000 ng/dl) Circulating levels in females vary according to reproductive maturity, phase of the menstrual cycle, time of day, and also feeding. There are no age and gender normal ranges, and in fact there is no testosterone standard on which to base an assay. Other steroids with similar configuration may cross-react with the antibody used in immunoassay. Measurement of total testosterone by mass spectrometry (MS) has been recommended as a possible solution to these problems. This is usually performed after extraction and purification by chromatography and is thought to be highly accurate, although gas chromatography (GC) (which is more difficult and costly) appears to be more precise than liquid chromatography (LC) Ref Dutta 4/e p 524; speroff 7/e p 502- 511",

        "exp": "In PCOD Determination of FSH and LH may help to confirm the diagnosis of poly cystic ovaries. These are assayed on the second or third day of cycle Lutenizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) LH and FSH are the hormones that encourage ovulation. Both LH and FSH are secreted by the pituitary gland in the brain. At the beginning of the cycle, LH and FSH levels usually range between about 5-20 mlU/ml. Most women have about equal amounts of LH and FSH during the early pa of their cycle. However, there is a LH surge in which the amount of LH increases to about 25-40 mlU/ml 24 hours before ovulation occurs. Once the egg is released by the ovary, the LH levels goes back down. While many women with PCOS still have LH and FSH still within the 5-20 mlU/ml range, their LH level is often two or three times that of the FSH level. For example, it is typical for women with PCOS to have an LH level of about 18 mlU/ml and a FSH level of about 6 mlU/ml (notice that both levels fall within the normal range of 5-20 mlU/ml). This situation is called an elevated LH to FSH ratio or a ratio of 3: 1. This change in the LH to FSH ratio is enough to disrupt ovulation. While this used to be considered an impoant aspect in diagnosing PCOS, it is now considered less useful in diagnosing PCOS, but is still helpful when looking at the overall picture.
