Now remember in options to confuse you instead of pubococcygeus they have given Pubocervical, which is a ligament connecting cervix to pubic bone and is not attached to perineal body. Ischiocavernosus repeatedly I have told is a lateral muscle and not midline and hence is not attached to perineal body. Ischiococcygeus or simply coccygeus is a triangular plane of muscular and tendinous fibers, arising by its apex from the spine of the ischium and sacrospinous ligament, and inserted by its base into the margin of the coccyx and into the side of the lowest piece of the sacrum.
