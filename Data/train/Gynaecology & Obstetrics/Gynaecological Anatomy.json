Before going into its details lets have a second look at the options. All the options given in the question are somehow related to vagina, therefore may have a role in supporting vagina except the infundibulopelvic ligaments.* Infundibulopelvic ligament attach the ovary to the lateral pelvic wall and supporta the ovary, but has no connection to the vagina or uterus, therefore does not support either structures.So, by exclusion, our answer is infundibulopelvic ligament.Now, coming on to the details of supports of vagina.Vagina is supported in the lower part by:* Bulbocavernosus muscle (at the level of introitus)* Urogenital diaphragm* Perineal muscles* Levator ani muscles (known as pelvic diaphragm) support the lower 1/3rd of vaginaIn its upper part: vagina is supported by: Cardinal ligament (also called as transverse cervical ligament)The anterior wall of vagina, urethra and bladder base are supported by: Pubocervical fasciaThe posterior wall of vagina is supported by: Perineal body",
