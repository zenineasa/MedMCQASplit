There will be no evidence of circulatory overload in the healthy pregnant woman and most of the added volume of blood is accounted for by an increased capacity of the uterine, breast, renal, striated muscle, and cutaneous vascular systems. Plasma volume increases by 40-50%, and this is relatively greater than the increase in that of red cell mass (20-30%), resulting in hemodilution and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration.* The increased blood volume facilitates maternal and fetal exchanges of respiratory gases, nutrients, etc and it also reduces the impact of maternal blood loss during delivery.* Cardiac output is 40% higher than that in the non-pregnant state. This is primarily, due to an increase in stroke volume (35%) and, to a lesser extent, to a more rapid heart rate (15%). The systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreases which contributes toward the hyperdynamic circulation observed in pregnancy.* Blood pressure (BP): In spite of increased cardiac output, the BP remains almost within normal values. Systemic arterial pressure is never increased during normal gestation. In fact, by midpregnancy, a slight decrease in diastolic pressure can be recognized.",

SUPINE HYPOTENSION SYNDROME (POSTURAL HYPOTENSION): During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava when the patient is in supine position. In 90% cases this, however, results in opening up of the collateral circulation by means of paravertebral and azygos veins. In some cases (10%), when the collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return of the heart may be seriously curtailed. This results in production of hypotension, tachycardia and syncope called as supine hypotensive syndrome. The normal blood pressure is quickly restored by turning the patient to lateral position.
