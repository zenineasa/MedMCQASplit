HPV serotyping is not required for routine diagnosis.Treatment:* Condyloma acuminata may remain unchanged or resolve spontaneously.* Effect of treatment on future viral transmission is unclear. However, many women prefer removal, and lesions can be destroyed with sharp or electrosurgical excision, cryotherapy, or laser ablation. In addition, very large, bulky lesions may be managed with cavitational ultrasonic surgical aspiration.Medical Management of Genital Warts:* Topical 5-percent imiquimod cream (immunomodulator)* Podophyllin (antimitotic agent)* Trichloroacetic acid (proteolytic agent)* Bichloroacetic acid (proteolytic agent)* Intralesion injection of interferonNote: Intralesion injection of interferon has high cost, is painful and is inconvenient to administer, So this therapy is not recommended as a primary modality and is best reserved for recalcitrant cases.Therapy of choice: No data suggest the superiority of one treatment. Thus in general treatment should be selected based on clinical circumstances and patient and provider preferences.",

If some growth is visible then instead of colposcopy, punch biopsy should be done.* Pap smear is only a screening test. To confirm we need to do a biopsy.* In all visible lesions punch biopsy should be done* In case of invisible lesion colposcopic directed biopsy is the gold standard. Thus in this case since it is not mentioned growth is visible so we do colposcopy guided biopsy.HPV DNA testing is not recommended for HSL as in most of the cases it will be positive and that does not alter the management.\"If typical genital warts are found in young women or if HSIL or invasive cancer is identified on cytology or histology, then HPV infection is assumed, and HPV testing is unnecessary.\"",

Since this option is not given - we will go for next best option, i.e. RadiotherapyGenerally from stage II a-IV A when radiotherapy is given - external beam pelvic radiation precedes brachytherapy.
