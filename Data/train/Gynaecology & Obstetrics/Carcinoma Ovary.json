Hydrothorax develops secondary to flow of ascitic fluid into the pleural space via lymphatics of the diaphragm.* Ascites occurs (in 50% cases) when tumor size is >6cms.* Tumors producing Meig's syndrome manifest in the late childbearing period i.e., 30-40 years.* Both ascites and hydrothorax resolve spontaneously after removal of the tumor.Criteria for diagnosis of Meig's syndrome:* Tumor must be ovarian, solid and benign.* Both hydrothorax and ascites must be present.* Removal of the tumor must result in their spontaneous and permanent cure.Pseudomeig syndrome:* Can be seen in association with either benign or malignant tumor.* Hydrothorax could be a manifestation of pulmonary metastasis.* Syndrome can result from overstimulation of the ovaries with gonadotropins but, in such cases, the peritoneal exudate is more likely to be caused by an electrolyte imbalance rather than by ovarian tumor.",
