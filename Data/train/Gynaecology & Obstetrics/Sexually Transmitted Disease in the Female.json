Q- Sometimes, it can also occur in young women, but then face is the most common site involved.

Vaginal secretions are gray and thinly coat the vaginal walls. The pH of these secretions is higher than 4. 5 (usually 4. 7 to 5. 7). Microscopy of the vaginal secretions reveals an increased number of clue cells, and leukocytes are conspicuously absent. In advanced cases of BV, more than 20% of the epithelial cells are clue cells.
