The causes of late postpartum hemorrhage are: Retained bits of cotyledon or membranes (most common). Infection & separation of slough over a deep cervicovaginal laceration. Endometritis & subinvolution of the placental site--due to delayed healing process. Secondary hemorrhage from cesarean section wound usually occur between 10-14 days.-It is probably due to--(a) separation of slough exposing a bleeding vessel or (b) from granulation tissue. Withdrawal bleeding following estrogen therapy for suppression of lactation. Other rare causes are: Chorion-epithelioma occurs usually beyond 4 weeks of delivery; carcinoma cervix; placental polyp; infected fibroid or fibroid polyp and puerperal inversion of uterus. [?]. Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH): 15-30 min. after delivery, the uterus contracts to expel placenta from the decidua. Uteroplacental spiral arteries thrombose (involution) as the myometrium continues contract1deg; atony of the uterus causes uteroplacental spiral arteries to partially thromboes. 2deg; subinvolution occurs due to placenta retention +- infection. Causes of secondary Postpartum Haemorrhage are: Retained bits of placenta; Postpartum infection; Infection of Cervical and Vaginal Tears.

I memorized it by: Obstetric history which points towards PPH: Grand multiparaQ due to laxed abdomenH/o atonic PPHQ or adherant placenta. Examination findings which point towards PPH: Obesity: Malnutrition and/or anemia. Overdistended uterus due to:- HydramniosQ- Multiple pregnancyQ- Macrosomia. QGynaecological disorders:- Fibroid uterus- Uterine malformations. Factors increasing the risk of PPH at the time of delivery: Precipitate labor. Prolonged labor. Inadvertent use of oxytocics.
