A single gene located on chromo- some 6 encodes the alpha-subunit for h. CG, LH, FSH, and TSH. There are seven separate genes on chromosome 19 for the beta-h. CG- beta-LH family. The best-known biological function of h. CG is the so-called rescue and maintenance of function of the corpus luteum-- that is, continued progesterone production. Progesterone-producing life span of a corpus luteum of menstruation could be prolonged perhaps for 2 weeks by h. CG administration. Maximum plasma h. CG concentrations are attained well after h. CG-stimulated corpus luteum secretion of progesterone has ceased. Specifically, progesterone luteal synthesis begins to decline at about 6 weeks despite continued and increasing h. CG production.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. The involution of corpus luteum causes estradiol and progesterone levels to fall dramatically. Ref. Shaws 13th/e page 47, (12th/e p 39& 38). After ovulation corpus luteum forms and starts secreting estrogen, progesterone and inhibin. (The increased LH at the time of ovulation is responsible for maintaining the corpus luteum). Continued increase in estrogen and progesterone exerts inhibitory effect on Hypothalamus and pituitary (Remember that increased estrogen plus moderate amount of progesterone exerts negative feedback on hypothalamus and pituitary whereas increased estrogen and small amount of progesterone exerts positive feedback on the pituitary and hypothalamus and cause LH surge). So due to negative feedback of increased estrogen and moderate amount of progesterone the LH and FSH secretion decreases. Due to decreased LH, the corpus luteum starts degenerating and degenerates completely by about 9 days after ovulation. Due to degeneration of corpus luteum estrogen and progesterone secretion decreases rapidly. Due to rapid decrease in estrogen and progesterone the endometrium is unable to sustain itself and sloughs off (this is the end of menstrual cycle). On the other hand if fertilization occurs placenta will be formed. The placenta starts secreting a hormone called b HCG which maintains the corpus luteum and thus corpus luteum continues secreting estrogen and progesterone. The estrogen and progesterone maintains endometrium and thus pregnancy is sustained.",

CG)# It is a glycoprotein (molecular wt 36, 000 to 40, 000 d) with highest carbohydrate (30%) content of any human hormone. It is structurally related to three other glycoprotein hormones--LH, FSH, and TSH.# The 36-hour plasma half-life of intact h. CG is much longer than the 2 hours for LH.# Biosynthesis:- Source: Syncytiotrophoblasts of placenta- A single gene located on chromosome 6 encodes the -subunit of all four glycoprotein hormones--h. CG, LH, FSH, and TSH.- The secretion of b-h. CG roughly corresponds to placental mass, whereas the rate of secretion of the complete h. CG molecule is maximal at 8 to 10 weeks' gestation. Plasma cone of beta-h. CG, although a minor portion of intact h. CG at 10 weeks, can represent 30 to 50 percent during the last trimester.# Concentrations of h. CG in Serum and Urine:- The intact h. CG molecule is detectable in plasma of pregnant women about 7 to 9 days after the midcycle surge of LH that precedes ovulation. Thus, it is likely that h. CG enters maternal blood at the time of blastocyst implantation. Blood levels increase rapidly, doubling every 2 days, with maximal levels being attained at about 8 to 10 weeks' gestation.- Because h. CG circulates as multiple highly related isoforms with variable cross-reactivity between commercial assays, there is considerable variation in calculated serum h. CG levels among the more than 100 assays. Peak levels reach about 100, 000 mlU/mL between the 60th and 80th days after the last menses. Beginning at about 10 to 12 weeks' gestation, maternal plasma levels of h. CG begin to decline, and a nadir is reached by about 20 weeks. Plasma levels are maintained at this lower level for the remainder of pregnancy.- The pattern of appearance of h. CG in fetal blood is similar to that in the mother, however, fetal plasma levels are only about 3 percent of those in maternal plasma.# Elevated or Depressed h. CG Levels in Maternal Plasma or Urine:- Significantly higher plasma levels of h. CG are sometimes found in:- Women pregnant with multiple fetuses or with a single erythroblastotic fetus resulting from maternal D-antigen isoimmunization.- Hydatidiform mole or choriocarcinoma.- Women carrying a fetus with Down's syndrome, and this finding can be used in biochemical screening tests# Relatively lower levels of h. CG in plasma are found with:- Ectopic pregnancies and impending spontaneous abortion.# Biological Functions of h. CG- The best-known biological function of h. CG is the so-called rescue and maintenance of function of the corpus luteum--that is, continued progesterone production.- Used to detect pregnancy because it appears in the urine 8 days after successful fertilization (blood and urine tests available).- Elevated h. CG in women with hydatidiform moles or choriocarcinoma.- It stimulates fetal testicular testosterone secretion that is maximum at approximately the same time that maximal levels of h. CG are attained. h. CG enters fetal plasma from the syncytiotrophoblast, acts as an LH surrogate, and stimulates replication of testicular Leydig cells and testosterone synthesis to promote male sexual differentiation.- There is h. CG stimulation of the maternal thyroid gland.- Other functions include:* Promotion of relaxin secretion by the corpus luteum.* LH-h. CG receptors are found in myometrium and in uterine vascular tissue, and it has been hypothesized that h. CG may act to promote uterine vascular vasodilatation and myometrial smooth muscle relaxation. Note: Peak levels reached on 72nd day or 12th week of pregnancy.",

In addition, varying numbers of leukocytes, erythrocytes and bacteria are usually evident, and small numbers of other contaminating cells and microorganisms are sometimes observed. Analyzing a vaginal smear is largely an exercise in classifying the epithelial cells into one of three fundamental types: parabasal, intermediate or superficial cells. Parabasal cells are the smallest epithelial cells seen on a typical vaginal smear. They are round or nearly round and have a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. Intermediate Cells. Intermediate cells vary in size and shape, but typically have a diameter two to three times that of parabasal cells. Many cytologists subclassify these cells into: Small intermediates - nearly round or oval shape with large, prominent nuclei. Large intermediates - polygonal shape with a small nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio Intermediate cells are prevalent during all stages of the cycle except estrus. Superficial Cells. Superficial cells are the largest cells seen on a vaginal smear. They are polygonal in shape and distinctly flat, sometimes having the appearance of being rolled up. Their nuclei are either absent or pyknotic (very small and dark). Superficial cells without nuclei are often referred to as being \"fully comified\".",

        "exp": "Ans: c (Follicle stimulating hormone) Ref: Shaw, 13th ed, p. 28. Development of a primordial follicle into a graffian follicle is under the control of follicle stimulating hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary. FSH produces grow'th and development of ovarian follicles during the first 14 days after menses. This leads to gradual increase in estradiol production from granulosa cells of the ovary. This rise in estrogen suppresses FSF1 secretion initially (negative feedback). But then above a certain level, estradiol stimulates an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of Gn. RH pulses resulting in marked increase in LH secretion (positive feedback). i. e. minimum estradiol causes decrease in FSH high level of estradiol causes increase in LH secretion. This mid cycle peak of LH i. e.. LH surge induces ovulation. Thus in late proliferative phase of menstrual cycle. LH surge is triggered by an estradiol peak which exerts a positive feedback on LH secretion. Exogenously administered estrogen causes negative feedback on LH secretion. Progesterone. It maintains the uterus in quiescent stage during pregnancy by relaxing the myometrium. Corpus luteum is the major source of progesterone during first 10 week of gestation. After 12 weeks placenta is the major source of production of progesterone. The major substrate for progesterone is maternal cholesterol. Plasma progesterone level rises during pregnancy till term and falls rapidly after delivery, undetectable after 24 hrs post partum. Fetal synthesis contributes little to maternal level, therefore progesterone level will remain high even after fetal demise. Note: Corpus luteum is maintained by - lutenizing hormone.

In most nursing mothers, the ovarian cycle and ovulation does not resume until a few weeks after cessation of nursing the baby. The cause of this seems to be that the same nervous signals from the breasts to the hypothalamus that cause prolactin secretion during suckling either because of the nervous signals themselves or because of the subsequent effect of the increased prolactin, inhibit secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone by the hypothalamus. This in turn, suppresses the formation of the pituitary gonadotrophic hormones, leutinizing hormones and follicle stimulating hormone. Yet, after several months of lactation in some mothers, especially in those who nurse their babies only part of the time, the pituitary does begin again to secrete sufficient gonadotropic hormones to reinstate the monthly sexual cycle even though nursing continues.",
