        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Prevents estrogen production from extraovarian sources o Both the drugs anastrazole and tamoxifene are used in the medical management of patients with breast carcinoma. These patients mostly belong to old age group and the main source of estrogen is from peripheral conversion of androgen to estrogen using aromatase enzyme.o Tamoxifene antagonizes the action of estrogen on breast and so is used in breast carcinoma management, it does not have an effect on the peripheral conversion of androgen to estrogen.o Anastrazole on the other hand is an aromatase inhibitor and is responsible to block the peripheral conversion of androgen to estrogen; thus blocking the main source of estrogen in post menopausal older age group women. This is an advantage of using anastrazole over tamoxifene.Note:# Letrozole group of drugs (anastrazole) are highly teratogenic and should be avoided during pregnancy.# Cardiomyopathy is a serious side effect of tamoxifene.# Drug of choice for Her2/Neu +ve carcinoma breast is transtuzumab.",

Somewhat effective alternatives may be progestins such as medroxyprogesterone (10 to 30 mg daily orally) or megestrol acetate (20 to 40 mg daily orally). If either of these progestins results in intolerable side effects, the use of alternative progestins may be considered, although few data exist regarding their efficacy.In addition to the progestins, other nonsteroidal treatments for hot flashes have been developed. One of the best studied is the b 2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine. This drug probably works through both central and peripheral mechanisms and can be given either orally (0.05 mg twice daily) or by transdermal patch.",

It is not known whether it can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Nitroprusside sodium should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.In three studies in pregnant ewes, nitroprusside was shown to cross the placental barrier and cause fetal cyanide poisoning.
