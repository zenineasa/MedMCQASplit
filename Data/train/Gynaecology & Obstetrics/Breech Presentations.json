Management principles: There are some Dos and DONTs for the management'DONTs'- (1) Do not be panicky (2] Do not give traction over baby's head (3) Do not apply fundal pressure. DOSs'- (1) Call for extra help (2) Clear the infant's mouth and nose (3) Involve the anaesthesist and the paediatrician. (4) Perform a wide mediolateral episiotomy, if made earlier. Me Roberts maneuver & Wood's maneuver are also used in Shoulder dystocia- Dutta Obstetrics 6th/407-08. Fundal pressure is avoided as it causes further impaction of the shoulder.

Arrest occurs with the delivery of the trunk up to the costal marginso The diagnosis is made by noting the winging of the scapula and absence of the flexed limbs in front of the chesto Management: The management calls for the urgent delivery of the arms, first the posterior and then the anterior one. o The delivery of the arm may be accomplished by adopting any one of the following methods: a. Classicalb. Lovset. Lovset's maneuvero It is widely practiced in preference to the classical method of bringing down an arm. Advantages: 1) Wider applicability-It can be applied even when the classical method becomes difficult. 2) Intrauterine manipulation is nil. 3) A single manipulation is effective to all types of displacement of the arms. 4) General anesthesia is usually not needed. o Principles: Because of the curved birth canal, when the anterior shoulder remains above the symphysis pubis, the posterior shoulder will be below the sacral promontory. If the fetal trunk is rotated keeping the back anterior and maintaining a downward traction, the posterior shoulder will appear below the symphysis pubis.",

Lovset's maneuvero Principle: Because of the curved birth canal, when the anterior shoulder remains above the symphysis pubis, the posterior shoulder will be below the sacral promontory. If the fetal trunk is rotated keeping the back anterior and maintaining a downward traction, the posterior shoulder will appear below the symphysis pubis. About other optionso Impacted breech: Inspite of good uterine contractions and complete dilatation of the cervix, the breech fails to descend. This occurs only in extended breech and is usually due to disproportiono Impaction can occur at the inlet, cavity or outlet. If within 30 minutes of full dilatation, the breech does not descend and distend the perineum, caesarean section is done regardless of the level of impaction. Frank Breech Extraction (Pinard's maneuver)o Is done by intrauterine manipulation (for breech decomposition) to convert a frank breech to a footling breech. This is possible when the membranes have ruptured recentlyo In Pinard's maneuver, the middle and index fingers are carried upto the popliteal fossa. It is then pressed and abducted so that the fetal leg is flexed. The fetal foot is grasped at the ankle and breech extraction is accomplished. Option 'c'o For delivery of the after coming head of breech, following maneuvers are used:# Bums marshall method# Forceps delivery# Malar flexion shoulder traction (modified Mauriceau - Smellie - Veit technique).",
