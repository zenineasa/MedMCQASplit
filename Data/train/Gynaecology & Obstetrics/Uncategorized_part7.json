Development of placenta As pregnancy advances, villi on the embryonic pole grow and develop into the chorion frondosum, whereas villi on the opposite abembryonic pole degenerate. and this smooth chorion is called the chorion laeve. Similarly, the decidua overlying the chorion frondosum is called the decidua basalis, with large decidual cells full of glycogen and lipids. The decidua over the abembyronic pole is the decidua capsularis. The chorion frondosum along with decidua basalis forms the placenta.

If the fetus is premature and if hemorrhaging is not severe, vaginal examination of a woman suspected of having placenta pre frequently can be delayed until 37 weeks gestation; this delay in the potentially hazardous examination reduces the risk of prematurity, which is often associated with placenta pre. Vaginal examination, when needed to determine whether a low- lying placenta is covering the internal os of the cervix, should be performed in an operating room fully prepared for an emergency cesarean section. Increasing maternal age and multiparity are associated with a higher incidence of placenta pre. Also Know: Placenta pre is used to describe a placenta that is implanted over or very near the internal cervical os. There are several possibilities: Total placenta pre--the internal os is covered completely by placenta Paial placenta pre--the internal os is paially covered by placenta Marginal placenta pre--the edge of the placenta is at the margin of the internal os Low-lying placenta--the placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment such that the placental edge does not reach the internal os, but is in close proximity to it Vasa pre--the fetal vessels course through membranes and present at the cervical os.

        "exp": "Ans. is a i. e. Hysterectomy Before discussing the answer to this questions lets first have a look at the treatment modalities available in case of CIN Modalities for management of CIN Ablative procedures Cryotherapy * Loop electro surgical * Hysterectomy Laser Vaporisation Therapy excision (LEEP) * Conisation Ablative Procedures: They are performed in out patient setting (OPD procedures). They must only be performed when the following conditions exist: There is no evidence of micro invasion or invasive cancer (on cytology, colposcopy or ECC). The lesion is located on the ectocervix (as determined by colposcopy and ECC). There is no involvement of the endocervix (as determined by colposcopy and ECC). Cytology and histology correspond with each other Modalities available in Ablative procedure: Cryotherapy It destroys the surface epithelium of the cervix by crystallizing the intra cellular water, resulting in eventual destruction of the cell. Major advantage is its ability to control exactly the depth and width of destruction by It is useful when: It is paicularly useful in: - Small lesions - Larger lesions that cryoprobe cannot cover - CIN Grade I & II - Irregular cervix with a Fish Mouth appearance. - When lesion is located in ectocervix - Extension of the disease to vagina or satellite lesions on Vagina Lesions with extensive glandular involvement Depth of destruction = 4-5 mm * Depth of destruction = 7mm Complications: - Discharge (M/C) * Complications: - Slight discharge Bleeding (Rare) - Pain - Cervical Stenosis (Rare) - Bleeding - Infection (Rare) drawback of Ablative procedures: it destroys the tissue and so no tissue specimen is available for additional histological evaluation. deg Excici'InI Procedures: They can be used LEEP (Loop electrosurgical excision Cold Knife Conization procedure) or LLETZ= (Large loop excision of transformation zone) It is both diagnostic as well as therapeutic. It is an OPD procedure & requires LA. Now it has become the procedure of choice for treating CIN II & CIN III. Complications are less & include: - Slight bleeding - Infection It is both diagnosis and therapeutic (Indications-given earlier) It is performed in 0. T and requires GA It refers to the excision of a cone shaped pa of cervix using a scalpel. Complications are more: - Paindeg - Bleedingdeg - Infectiondeg when Endocervix is involved as well Disadvantages of Excisional procedures: All Excisional procedures produce - Pregnancy complication. Cervical stenosisdeg Incompetent osdeg Aboiondeg Premature labourdeg Dystociadeg Advantage of excision procedures over ablative methods is tissue is available after excision method for fuher histological studies and Transformation zone is visible. Remember: In both ablative and excision methods patient should be followed with Pap smears every 3-4 months and by endocervical curettage (ECC), if endocervix is involved. As far as hysterectomy is concerned: \"Hysterectomy is unacceptable as primary therapy for C1. N1, 2 or 3. However it may be considered when treating recurrent high grade cervical disease if childbearing has been completed or when a repeat cervical exicison is strongly indicated but technically not feasible. \" But most of the other books say that: Large Loop excision of transformation zone has become the procedure of choice for management of CIN in many developed countries. But in developing countries where women are likely to default from follow up, hysterectomy is still the best option. According to Shaw 14/e, p 365? Hysterectomy is desirable in: * Older and parous women When a woman cannot comply with follow-up If uterus is associated with fibroids, DUB or prolapse. If micro invasion exists. If recurrence occurs following conservative therapy. According to Jeffocate 7/e, p 421? \"If smear remains or becomes positive after conservative surgery, total hysterectomy is indicated, but the ovaries need not be removed if the woman is premenopausal. There is also a place for totarhysterectomy as an elective procedure when micro-invasion is found on biopsy, or when the patient is more than 40 years of age. \" Indications of Hysterectomy in CIN according to are: Microinvasion. CIN III at limits of conization specimen in selected patients. Poor compliance with follow up. Other gynaecologic problems requiring hysterectomy such as fibroids, prolapse, endometriosis and PID.",

If para aortic lymph nodes are involved then only extended field radiotherapy should be given. \"The routine use of extended field radiation for prophylactic para aortic radiation without documentation of distant metastasis to para aortic nodes was evaluated and is not practiced because of increased enteric morbidity associated with this treatment modality. \" Note: \u2022 IOC to know whether para-aortic lymph nodes are evolved is PET/CT imaging studies. \u2022 Radiotherapy for para aortic lymph nodes leads to bowel complications and to avoid these complications, extra peritoneal dissection of para aortic nodes is recommended and the dose of radiation should be reduced to 5000 c. Gy or less. When this approach is used, post radiotherapy bowel complications occur in < 5% patients and 5 year survival rate is 15-26% in patients with positive para aortic nodes. Option \"d\": Chemotherapy is reserved for last stages.... Correct Option \"e\": From stage 1B onwards same prognosis with surgery and RT. The only data which I could get on this is - \"Stages 1. B1, 1. B2 and 2A (size of lesion <4 cms)-these patients can be managed by surgery or primary chemoradiation. Several studies showed similar survival rates and outcomes. In bulky stages 1. B2 and 2. A2 -chemoradiation should be preferred but if patient wishes to conserve ovary then surgery should be done but it has increased morbidity because most of these patients have intermediate or high risk factors present for which post operative radiotherapy or chemoradiation has to be given. \"",

        "exp": "Primary infeility affects 15-20% of married couples. Apa from case history and physical examination, endocrine profile and semen analysis are essential to disclose the underlying cause. The testes have two distinct but related functions, both of which are under adenohypophyseal and hypothalamic control. The first one is the production and storage of ble spermatozoa, and the second one is the synthesis and secretion of androgenic hormones. Various factors that can induce sterility in men are: trauma, infections like mumps, environmental factors like excessive heat, medications, and drugs. Because of the failure of testes to descend into the scrotum, seminiferous tubules remain infantile in structure and due to greater temperature of the inguinal canal, they degenerate. However, the secondary sexual characteristics are not affected. Ref: Hoffman B. L., Schorge J. O., Schaffer J. I., Halvorson L. M., Bradshaw K. D., Cunningham F. G., Calver L. E. (2012). Chapter 20.

Women who are overweight - or underweight - tend to have a more difficult time conceiving. The same goes for men, but more about that later. '- http //www early-pregnancy-tests com/ weight-feility html 'Exercise can affect feility in several ways. Over-exercising is one of the bigger causes of infeility for women. If a woman exercises too much, she is at a risk of losing too much of her body fat. Body fat plays an essential role in the production of estrogen; without enough estrogen, a woman who over-exercises might not ovulate. The technical term for not ovulating is oligomenorrhea, and is a major cause of feility problems. Women who don't get enough exercise can impact their feility negatively as well. By not getting enough exercise, a woman runs the risk of becoming overweight or obese. An overweight or obese woman, because she has more fat cells, can actually have too much estrogen. This overproduction of estrogen can negatively impact ovulation and conception. In addition, being overweight puts you at risk for insulin resistance, which can ultimately keep you from ovulating. http://wwwbabyhopes. com/aicles/exercise-feility. html",

Congenital malformations in a diabetic mother occur within first 8 weeks of gestation when most women are just begining prenatal care. Therefore preconceptional counselling is very essential in a diabetic mother Screening for diabetes during pregnancy: Glucose Challenges Test? Screening for gestational diabetes is performed by orally administering 50g of glucose and measuring venous plasma glucose 1 hour later. (The test is done irrespective of the time of last meal and can be done at any time of day) Interpretation of result: - Plasma glucose: Interpretation - 140 mg/dl Fuher testing by GTT required - 140mg/dI Fuher testing not required. - >200mg/dI No fuher testing required as values > 200mg/dl confirm the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Time for screening: between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation (patients at high risk should be screened as early as possible and if initial screenings is negative it can be repeated between 26 and 30 weeks). Instead of 'universal screening', a 'selective screening' should be adopted Glucose Tolerance test: Patients with abnormal screening test are followed by a 3 hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) The test is performed with 100gm of glucose.

A large-caliber catheter minimizes the potential for catheter blockage by blood clots, mucus, and calcaneus deposits. - Type and duration of catheter drainage: For fistulas involving the lower poion of the bladder trigone, bladder neck, or urethra, transurethral bladder catheters should not be used. A large suprapubic catheter is preferable to minimize excess tension on the suture line and to ensure nonobstructed continuous drainage. In posthysterectomy VVF repairs, both transurethral and suprapubic catheters may be placed. Surgeries to repair pelvic radiotherapy-associated VVFs require longer periods of drainage. Acidification of urine to diminish risks of cystitis, mucus production, and formation of bladder calculi is a consideration for patients with an indwelling catheter. Vitamin C or methenamine mandelate can be used. Estrogen replacement therapy in the postmenopausal patient may assist with optimizing tissue vascularization and healing. Control of postoperative bladder spasms: Urised iseffective for control of postoperative bladder spasms. It is a combination of antiseptics (methenamine, methylene blue, phenyl salicylate, and benzoic acid) and parasympatholytics (tropine sulfate, and hyoscyamine sulfate). Antibiotic therapy: Close follow-up and prompt evaluation for any urinary tract infections and antibiotic therapy, when indicated, are mandatory. Minimizing Valsalva maneuvers: Stool softeners and a high-fiber diet postoperatively minimize Valsalva maneuvers in the patient.

Immediate delivery of the fetus may be indicated if the fetus is mature or if the fetus or mother are in distress. Blood volume replacement (to maintain blood pressure) and blood plasma replacement (to maintain fibrinogen levels) may be necessary. In cases of fetal distress, associated complicating factors like malpresentation, elderly primigravidae, pregnancy with a previous caesarean section and contracted pelvis, a caesarean section is indicated.

Friends you should also keep in mind the following impoant points regarding - Fibroids and pregnancy. Effects of Fibroid on pregnancy: Infeility - Leiomyomas are a sole cause of infeility in less than 30/0 of cases. deg - It causes infeility by: Hindering the ascent of the spermatozoa by distoing the uterus and tubes. By disturbances in ovulation and By interfering with implantation of the feilized ovum. - Pregnancy rate following myomectomy = 40%deg Aboiondeg, Placental abruptiondeg and Premature labourdeg. Occurs when fibroid interferes with enlargement of uterus, initiates abnormal uterine contractions or prevents efficient placentation, Ma! positiondeg and Malpresentationdeg of Fetus: occur as fibroid can prevent engagement of head. Obstructed labour: It can be caused by cervicaldeg and broad ligament tumoursdeg which are fixed in the pelvis and by pedunculated subserous leiomyomas which become trapped in the pouch of Douglas. During labour - If fibroid is situated above the presenting pa - uneventful vaginal delivery. - If fibroid is situated below the presenting pa spontaneous vaginal delivery may occur; otherwise caesarean section is done.

Symptom In Ectopic pregnancy triad of: Amenorrhea (seen in 75% cases) followed by: Abdominal pain (seen in 100% cases, it is the most consistent symptom of ectopic pregnancy). Appearance of vaginal bleeding are seen: The above triad may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fainting attacks or syncope. Patient may present in shock with pallor, tachycardia, hypotension and cold clammy extremities. Examination General examination: -- P/R T -- Pallor +nt -- BP. 1, -- Slight intermittent pyrexia due to absorption of products of degeneration. Per Abdomen - Abdomen is tense, tender and distended. -- Shifting dullness may be present (depending on the amount of hemorrhage). -- Rigidity / muscle guarding +/--, -- Cullen's sign - bluish discolouration around the umbilicus may be present. On Bimanual examination -- Vaginal mucosa appears blanched. deg -- Uterus: normal size / slightly bulky. -- Extreme tenderness on cervical movement -- Fornices - tender. (Remember - tenderness in pelvis is the most constant sign of Ectopic pregnancy). -- U/L adnexal mass: is palpable in one third to half of patient. Culdocesitt: si It is a simple technique used to identify hemoperitoneum. Fluid is aspirated from cul-de-sac posterior fornix with the help of a needle. If non clotting blood is obtained, it is indicative of an intraperitoneal bleed and probably a ruptured ectopic. Note: If the aspirated blood clots, it may have been obtained from an adjacent blood vessel rather than from bleeding ectopic pregnancy. The women in the question is presenting with amenorrhea of 6 weeks and pain in abdomen. On USG - fluid is seen in POD and aspiration of dark coloured blood which fails to clot - all these features leave no doubt of ectopic pregnancy. \"Sonographic absence of uterine pregnancy, a positive pregnancy test ($ -HCG), fluid in cul-de-sac and an abnormal pelvic mass. ectopic pregnancy is almost ceain. \"",

        "question": "Most common cervical carcinoma: March 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cervical cancer is typically composed of squamous cells. The most impoant risk factor in the development of cervical cancer is infection with a high-risk strain of Human papilloma virus. Women who have many sexual paners (or who have sex with men or women who had many paners) have a greater risk Risk factors for cervical cancer: HPV infection (16, 18, 31, 33), HIV infection Smoking Chlamydia infection, Multiple pregnancies Exposure to the hormonal drug (DES) and a Family history of cervical cancer. Biopsy Procedures While the pap smear is an effective screening test, confirmation of the diagnosis of cervical cancer or pre-cancer requires a biopsy of the cervix. This is often done through colposcopy. Fuher diagnostic procedures are loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP) and conization. These are carried out if the biopsy confirms severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Pathologic Types Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, the precursor to cervical cancer, is often diagnosed on examiniation of cervical biopsies. Histologic subtypes of invasive cervical carcinoma include the following: Squamous cell carcinoma (about 80-85%) Adenocarcinoma (nearly 5%) Adenosquamous carcinoma Small cell carcinoma Neuroendocrine carcinoma Staging Cervical cancer is staged by the FIGO staging system Stage 0 - full-thickness involvement of the epithelium without invasion into the stroma (carcinoma in situ) Stage I - limited to the cervix - IA - diagnosed only by microscopy; no visible lesions IA1 - stromal invasion less than 3 mm in depth and 7 mm or less in horizontal spread IA2 stromal invasion between 3 and 5 mm with horizontal spread of 7 mm or less - IB - visible lesion or a microscopic lesion with more than 5 mm of depth or horizontal spread of more than 7 mm IB1 - visible lesion 4 cm or less in greatest dimension IB2 - visible lesion more than 4 cm Stage II - invades beyond cervix - IIA - without parametrial invasion, but involve upper 2/3 of vagina - IIB - with parametrial invasion Stage III - extends to pelvic wall or lower third of the vagina - IIIA - involves lower third of vagina - IIIB - extends to pelvic wall and/or causes hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney IVA - invades mucosa of bladder or rectum and/or extends beyond true pelvis IVB - distant metastasis Treatment Microinvasive cancer (stage IA) is usually treated by hysterectomy (removal of the whole uterus including pa of the vagina). For stage IA2, the lymph nodes are removed as well. Early stages (IB1 and IIA less than 4 cm) can be treated with radical hysterectomy with removal of the lymph nodes or radiation therapy. Larger early stage tumors (IB2 and IIA more than 4 cm) may be treated with radiation therapy and cisplatin/ Paclitaxel+Ifosamide+Mesna based chemotherapy, hysterectomy (which then usually requires adjuvant radiation therapy), or cisplatin/ Paclitaxel+Ifosamide+Mesna chemotherapy followed by hysterectomy. Advanced stage tumors (IIB-IVA) are treated with radiation therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The use of a combination of two chemotherapy drugs, hycamtin and cisplatin for women with late-stage (IVB) cervical cancer treatment is recommended. Combination treatment has significant risk of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia side effects.",

Let's now have a look at Endometrial hyperplasia. Endometrial Hyperplasia It represents a spectrum of morphological and biological alteration of endometrium (both glandsdeg +Stromadeg), ranging from an exaggerated physiological state to carcinoma in situ. They are clinically impoant because: They cause abnormal bleeding. deg Either preceede or occur simultaneously with Endometrial carcinoma. Endometrial Hyperplasia can be: If atypical cells are present in either of the two types - chances of malignancy increase. Simple atypical hyperplasia is a relatively uncommon diagnosis. In general, most atypical hyperplasias have a complex architecture. Characteristics of Atypical cells: deg You must have already learnt in pathology, but I will brief it up here for convenience: Large in sizedeg Loss of polaritydeg Irregular shapedeg Hyperchromatic nucleusdeg and prominent nucleolideg Altered nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio. deg Chances of Progression to Carcinoma: Type of hyperplasia Simple without atypia Complex without atypia Simple with atypia Complex with atypia Thus, minimum chances of progression to carcinoma are with simple-hyperplasia without atypia and maximum chances of carcinoma are with complex hyperplasia with atypia. deg",

Only Shaw's throws some light on this issue. \"Intramural and submucous tumours have a higher potential for Sarcomatous change than Subserous tumour. \"... Shaw 14/e. p 319 Since percentage of intramural tumours is much higher than submucous, so we take Intramural as the correct option. But finally it is upto you to decide. Also know: Sarcomatous change is seen in only 0. 2 - 0. 5% of cases.

Friends, I know this is quite difficult to digest as we have been studying, Progesterone only pills act mainly by causing thickening of cervical mucus. But read the question once again: here question specifically mentions; ''newer progestational pills\". Read what FOGSI supplement has to say about mode of action of Progesterone only pills (also known as Estrogen Free Pills). Cervical Mucus effect: All Estrogen free pills except the newer desogesterel pill primarily rely on changes in cervical mucus as they do not inhibit ovulation consistently. The cervical mucus effect peaks within 3-4 hours after taking the tablet and lasts for about 22 hours. Hence the next tablet must be taken within 27 hours of the preceeding tablet or else the contraceptive benefit of the cervical mucus effect will decrease and finally subside. Inhibition of ovulation: Unlike COC's (Combined OCP's) that almost always prevent ovulation, traditional POP's (progesterone only pills) inhibit ovulation in 40-50% of cycles. A randomized double blind study, performed over 13 cycles showed that 75 micrograms desogestrel daily was sufficient to inhibit ovulation in 97% of cycles. Hence for newer POP's containing desogestre! the primary mode of action is inhibition of ovulation. Fogsi Focus Jan 06 issue on Modern pill, Chapter Estrogen free pill p 41. Thus, for newer progestational agents main mechanism of action is by inhibition of ovulation. Friends, I would like to discuss Progesterone only pills in detail here as Question can be asked on them anytime. Progesterone only pills: Mechanism of action Traditional POP/ Low dose POP Newer POP containing desogestrel Thickening of cervical Mucus Inhibition of ovulation Failure Rate = 2-6/100 women years Failure Rate 0. 2 to 0. 4/100 women years Indications of all POP's: Category 1 = Unrestricted use: Can be used without restriction in presence of: Age over 16 years Smoking Obesity.

If female is not breast feeding: can be staed before 6 weeks Progesterone only pill should be taken every day without break and at the same time (For traditional POP's). deg For newer desogestrel containing pill, a delay of -12 hours can be accepted. Dealing with missed pills: Progesterone only pill also called as Minipill, is best suited for lactating mothers and is therefore known as Lactational pill. deg If POP (Traditional) have been missed by more than 3 hours or Desogestrel containing by more than 12 hours, then one pill should be taken as soon as possible followed by the usual daily dose. deg Abstinence or use of additional contraception (barrier method) is advised for the next 48 hours. deg Side effects Menstrual disturbances: Most common reason for discontinuation of POP's is irregular bleeding pattern. Other side effects: Headache, Acne, Breast pain, Nausea, Vaginitis and Dysmenorrhea. Carbohydrate metabolism: At high doses, most progestogens adversely affect carbohydrate metabolism whether given alone or in conjunction with estrogen. Hence POP's should not be advised to women with H/O Gestational diabetes mellitus. Also know: Traditional POP's are also known as Low dose progestogen only pills. Main progesterone used are:- Norethisterone 35. Oug - Norgestrel 75mg - Levonorgesterel 30. Ags. Their main mechanism of action (as discussed earlier) is Thickening of cervical mucus. deg They also: - Render endometrium unsuitable for implantation - Accelerate tuba! motility - Disturb corpus luteal function. A word of caution to all of you out there: Be careful in reading the question - whether question is on Low dose progestins (Traditional pills) or on Newer progestins containing desogestrel.",

        "exp": "Ans. is c i. e Estrogen Hormone Replacement Therapy for a oo. st - menopausal female can be in the form of Estrogen Alone Progesterone Tibolone Selective Androgens Estrogen Oestrogen Receptor Estrogens Modulator 1. Estrogen Alone: MC estrogen used: Conjugated equine oestrogen Advantages It decreases hot flushesdeg Prevents osteoporosisdeg Useful in senile vaginitisdeg Useful in dyspareunia and urethral syndromedeg Disadvantage: Besides the risk of Coronary heart diseasedeg. (as discussed earlier) it can cause Vaginal bleedingdeg, Endometrial hyperplasiadeg and Endometrial carcinomadeg so, estrogens are combined with progestins in H so as to decrease the risk of Endometrial hyperplasia with Endometrial carcinoma. Indications For the use of Estrogen Alone In woman who have undergone hysterectomy (other than that for Endometrial cancer) Remember: All women who have intact uterus or even those who underwent hysterectomy for endometrial Cancer (Stage I), endometroid ovarian tumors or endometriosis or those with Severe osteoporosis should receive combined estrogen - progesterone therapy or be considered for selective estrogen receptor modulator therapy. 2. Estrogen + Progesterone When H is to be given for a period more than 2-3 months, in woman with intact uterus progesterone should be given along with estrogen as progesterone is protective against Endometrial cancer. In Perimenopausal females: low dose OCP should be given. In Postmenopausal females: OCP's Should not be used, as the amount of estrogen is higher in them than required. In such cases oestrogen should be supplemented by progesterone for last 10-12 days of treatment. Most treatment regimes are on a cyclical 3 weeks out of 4 weeks. Progesterones used in H: Medroxy progesterone acetatedeg * Dydrogesteronedeg Norethisteronedeg * Desogestereldeg Micronized progesteronedeg Disadvantages of progesterones: Weight gain * Breast tenderness Bloated feeling * Depression Note: Progesterone should not be added in hysterectomised patients because of patients intolerance to them and for the fear of their adverse effects on lipid profile and the breast. 3. Tibolone: Is a synthetic derivative of 19 noestosteronedeg. It is metabolized into isomers with three major metabolic (oestrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic) effects. At a standard dose of 2. 5 mg: Tibolone has beneficial effects on Bone Vasomotor symptoms i. e. Genital tract i. e. Libido Mood prevents osteoporosis hot flushes vaginal atrophy increase libido Total HDL, LDL are not altered Triglycerides are decreased Endometrium atrophy occurs Inhibits breast cell proliferation. Major advantages: Low incidence of vaginal bleedingdeg Can be used in women with leiomyomas and endometriosis in whom conventional H may cause aggravation of symptoms. deg estrogen Receptor Modulator - (SERM) Drug used: Raloxifene It prevents osteoporosis by increasing Bone mineral density (is useful for patients who are reluctant to use H or have H/O endometriosis or high risk of Breast cancer) It also has ourable effect on lipoprotein A, LDL, homocysteine and fibrinogen It has no effect on atherosclerosisdeg, HDLdeg levels and may even increase hot flushes and Leg cramps. deg Side effects: Hot flushes, Crampsdeg, Venous thrombosisdeg and Retinopathydeg. Contraindication: * Venous Thrombosis (should not be given with estrogen) Hepatic dysfunction It should be stopped 72 hours before Surgery. Androgens (Testosterone): The only indication for the use of androgens in H is loss of libido. Recent Advances: Phytoestrogens These are substances found in plants like Soya and are strongly oestrogenic but-non steroidal thereby reducing the potential risk of breast cancer, liver disease and other side effects of estrogen. Their daily intake reduces hot flushes by 45% within 12 weeks. They improve plasma lipid profile and therefore inhibit the development of coronary atherosclerosis. Estrillshould no be used in women with any of the following conditions: 1. Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding. 2. Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer. 3. Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia. 4. Active deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or history of these conditions. 5. Active or recent (e. g., within the past year) aerial thromboembolic disease (e. g., stroke or myocardial infarction). 6. Liver dysfunction or disease. 7. Known hypersensitivity to the ingredients of the estrogen preparation. 8. Known or suspected pregnancy. There is no indication for estrogen in pregnancy. There appears to be little or no increased risk of bih defects in children born to women who have used estrogens and progestins from oral contraceptives inadveently during early pregnancy Estrogen should be used with caution In women with the following conditions: 1. Dementia 2. Gallblader disease 3. Hyperiglyceridemia 4. Prior cholestatic jaundice 5. Hypothyroidism 6. Fluid retention plus cardiac or renal dysfunction 7. Severe hypocalcemia 8.

        "exp": "Sedation and wait It is a case of prolonged latent phase of the labour Latent phase of the labour Latent phase of the labour is difficult to define. It stas with onset of painful regular uterine contractions and end when the cervix stas dilating at an active rate. A latent phase exceeding 6 hours in primigravida or 4 hours in multigravida is considered prolonged. Secondary arrest of active phase Active phase of the labour is defined as phase when active cervical dilatation occurs. Secondary arrest of cervical dilatation occurs when cervical dilatation ceases after a normal poion of active phase dilatation. This is believed to be due to cephalopelvic dispropoion. Prolonged latent phase The diagnosis of prolonged labour is made when there is little progress in cervical dilatation for several hours. (In the question the cervix is dilated. for I cm for the last 10 hrs). More common than the diagnosis of prolonged latent phase is the need to differentiate whether a patient is in false labour or in the latent phase. This differentiation may be achieved by continuous observation of the patient for at least 2 hours. Patients in false labour will show a pattern of irregular uterine contractions that eventually decrease in frequency and intensity and there are no cervical changes during the observation periods. Whereas patients in latent phase will show persistent regular uterine contractions that usually increase in intensity and frequency. In addition, patient in latent phase will show some cervical changes. A second method used to differentiate false labour from the latent phase of labour is therapeutic rest. 843 For this purpose the patient is given a 15 mg dose of morphine sulfate. Patients in false labour Sleep for a few hours and awake without contractions. Patietns in latent phase continue with contractions and show cervical changes after the sleeping period. The second most common practical problem related to the latent phase of labour occurs when patients have 3 or 4 cm of cervical dilatation and regular uterine contractions and no progress is observed during the following few hours. These patients may be in a late stage of their latent phase or have an early secondary arrest of dilatation. To distinguish between late latent phase and early secondary arrest it is necessary to take into consideration the patient's parity. - Multipara making little progress at 4 cm of dilatation most likely will be in latent phase. - A nullipara under the same circumstances most likely will be in early secondary arrest. The degree of cervical dilatation is also impoant. - 60% of the patient will be in active phase if the cervix is 4 cm dilated and 90% if it is 5 cm. Finally cervical effacement is a good criterion for recognizing patients in active phase. - Most patients will be in active phase if their cervix is dilated 3 cm or more and 100% effaced - If effacement is 50% or less most likely they are in latent phase. Management There are two modes of management for patients with prolonged latent phase. - Therapeutic rest - Oxytoein stimulation.",

Histologically these bands are made up of, fibrous tissue, myometrium and endometrium. The synechiaes usually results from destruction of large areas of endometrium by some surgical procedure (currettage). Uterine synechais are associated with early pregnancy loss.

Another way of defining contracted pelvis is where the essential diameters of one or more planes are shoened by 0. 5 cms. In the question it is clearly evident that Transverse diameter (10 cms) is too sho and is therefore contracted.

Perinatal mortality in twins varies with birth order and the type of placentation. \"Second twins do not do as well as the first twin... perinatal mortality being 9% for the first twin and 14% for the second twin\". Fernando Arias 3/e, p 297 Also monochorionic-monoamniotic twins have a poor prognosis, perinatal mortality being 50%. Now with this background lets see each option separately. Option a: First twin has more chances of asphyxia-incorrect as: \"Asphyxia and stillbirth are more common (in twin pregnancy) due to increased prevalence of pre-eclampsia, malpresentations, placental abruption and increased operative interferences. The second baby is more atrisk. Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 206 Option b: Second twin has more chances of developing polycythemia: This statement can be true as second baby has more chances of asphyxia which can stimulate erythropoeisis in the second twin. Also there are chances of bleeding from the first twin into the second twin in case of monochorionic twins which can cause polycythemia. Option c: Second twin has more chances of developing hyaline membrane disease-this is incorrect as is evident from the following lines of Williams: \"As measured by determination of the lecithin and sphingomyelin ratio, pulmonary maturation is usually synchronous in twins. \" Williams 23/e, p 880 Hence second twin does not have increased chances of developing hyaline membrane disease.

        "exp": "Ans. is c i. e. Post dated pregnancy Friends- Teenage pregnancy is not only a new topic for PGME exams but has envolved as an emerging problem in our daily OPD'S Hence I am giving in detail about Teenage pregnancy. Defination Teenage pregnancy is defined as pregnancy occurring in a girl below the age of 19. It can be divided into two groups. (i) the 17-19 group and (ii) the below 17 group. All the complications are more in the later group. Incidence Teenage pregnancy accounts for about 10-12% of all bihs. There are two categories of teenage pregnancies, the unwed mothers and the married teenagers. The increasing incidence of the first category is due to changing social norms, permissive attitudes of society, influence of the media and poor access to contraception. The fast breaking down of the joint family system, increase in drug addiction and premarital sex are all responsible for the increase in unwed mothers in our society. However, another large contributing factor for teen pregnancies is child marriage, which still prevails in many Indian states like Rajasthan and Bihar. Complications Maternal In general, maternal moality and morbidity are more among teenage pregnancies especially in the below 15 group and the unwed mothers because there is lack of antenatal care and a tendency to conceal the pregnancy in many cases. Criminal and septic aboions are more in these girls in spite of aboion being liberalized in India. Antepaum complications like anemia. malnutrition and pre- eclampsia are also much more in teenage pregnancy. Obstetric complications are also increased like, preterm labour, fetal prematurity and IUGR. Cephalopelvic dispropoion may be a problem in the very young teenagers. as they may not have attained complete skeletal maturity. Therefore. the incidence of caesarean section may be more in this group. Other labour complications are also increased if they present for the first time in labour, with out proper antenatal care. 4. Psychological problems. Pregnancy in a teenager is usually unplanned and the girl is undergoing severe mental and emotional trauma. Added to that, she may not be getting adequate family suppo. Depressive disorders and suicidal attempts are common in pregnancy. Even after delivery, maternal- fetal bonding may not be satisfactory. They are more prone to depressive problems and postpaum psychosis after delivery. Long-Term consequences Physical. Induced aboions may increase the risk of recurrent miscarriage, preterm labour and low bih weight babies in the subsequent pregnancy. There is also a higher chance of infeility later on due to infection and blocked tubes. Early age of onset of sexual intercourse and first pregnancy increases the risk of cancer cervix and preinvasive lesions of the cervix. There is also an increased chance of sexually transmitted diseases in unmarried mothers. Psychological - High suicide rates and depressive illness are common. Guilt feelings about a previous aboion or having given the baby for adoption, may occur, sometimes even years later. Social and educational problems. The girl may have to face social outracism which would definitely affect her life. Problems of child These mothers our not emotionally equipped to handle the responsibilities of motherhood. Hence there is poor maternal - child relationship, baby battering & behavioural disturbances in children of such mothers.",

Pelvic inflammatory disease and prior tubal surgery result in intraperitoneal scarring and adhesions that can alter the finely tuned transpo mechanisms in the fallopian tubes that are responsible for ensuring that the feilized ovum makes it to the endometrial cavity. Occasionally an ectopic pregnancy can be located in the cervix but this is very uncommon. The cervix is one of the three segments of the uterus (the other two being the body and the fundus). An ectopic pregnancy in this location can be difficult to address surgically. Some ectopic pregnancies are located on or near the ovary. The ovary lies near the fallopian tube in the broad ligament. Ectopic pregnancies on the ovary are also very uncommon. Very rarely an ectopic pregnancy will be located in the peritoneal cavity where it may attach to the surrounding intestines.

        "question": "Test for ovarian reserve -",
        "exp": "FSH Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce e. Rg. The ovary is generally thought of as an egg bank from which the woman draws during the reproductive life. During the first few days of each monthly cycle, under the influence of FSH and LH there is rapid growth of several follicles in the ovary. After a week or more of growth one of the follicles begin to outgrow All the others and the remaining. follicles involute (a process called atresia), and these. follicles are said to become atretic. The process of atresia is impoant because it normally allows only one of the follicles to grow large enough, each month, to ovulate. This usually prevents more than one child from developing with each pregnancy. The single. follicle reaches a diameter of 1-1. 5 centimeters at the time of ovulation and is called the mature follicle. With advancing age the capability of the ovan' to produce eggs declines. Methods of assessing ovarian reserve: With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce egg declines i. e. ovarian reserve decrease with age. - Usually age is the best predictor of ovarian reserve but approximately 10% of women have an accelarated loss of ovarian reserve by their mid-30's. - So age alone does not tell the whole story. Consequently more refined methods for predicting ovarian reserve have been developed. The methods for assessing ovarian reserve are classified into two groups:- a). Passive testing b) Dynamic testing The goal of both the approaches is to provide information regarding oocyte (egg) quality and quantity. Passive testing FSH level Early,, follicular phase FSH levels play an impoant role in pregnancy outcomes. As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this adaptive response remains unknown. A rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompained by a decline in oocyte quality. High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy. Generally FSH level are expected to be below 101uhn1in women with reproductive potential - In one study it was found out that 3 day FSH of less than 15 mlu/m1 were twice as likely to conceive than women with FSH values between 15 and 24. 9 mlu/ml. - Cycle day 3 is chosen because at this time the estrogen level is expected to be low, a critical feature as FSH levels are subject to a negative feedback. - Thus any determination of FSH needs to include corresponding estradiol level to indicate that the FSH level was drawn when estrogen level was low. Other methods for passive ovarian reserve testing Measurement of Inhibin B Inhibit B is an ovarian hormone that inhibits FSH release. Although present in ovulating women it is not normally,. found in postmenopausal women. - Low inhibin levels suggests poor ovarian reserve. Transvaginal ultrasound Diminished ovarian reserve means that fewer follicles are available for stimulation and recruitment by feility drugs. Transvaginal ultrasound allows the observation of ovaries and assess the number of follicles (ovarian volume). Dynamic ovarian reserve testing Clomiphene citrate challenge test? Clomiphene is an antiestrogen which inhibits the negative feedback of estrogen on hypothalamus i. e. the hypothalamus gets. false signals that the patient does not have enough estrogen. In response, the hypothalamus induces the pituitary gland to produce more FSH and LH. This is turn initiates. follicular growth to produce estrogen. Clomiphene is able to exe this effect only when the estrogen level is low or the ovarian reserve is low In a normal woman with adequate ovarian reserve there is enough inhibin and estrogen to suppress FSH production through negative feedback and resist the effects clomiphene. - When undergoing clomiphene citrate challenge test, the, first step is to measure day 3 FSH and estrogen. Then 100 mg of clomiphene is administered on cycles day 5 through 9 and FSH and estrogen. measurements are repeated on cycle day 10. In general, a high day 10 FSH suggests poor ovarian reserve.",

In infants that survive, paicularly if oxygen was used for therapy, the lungs eventually become heavily fibrotic (misnamed bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Abundant neutrophils would not be seen unless the patient had also developed pneumonia. Fibrosis is a late, not early, feature of respiratory distress syndrome. The air spaces are collapsed, not enlarged, in this condition. Ref: Cunningham F. G., Leveno K. J., Bloom S. L., Hauth J. C., Rouse D. J., Spong C. Y. (2010). Chapter 29.

Note:? o Usually in H combination of estrogen and progestin is given (combined H), except in hysterectimized women where estrogen alone is given. o With estrogen alone there is increased risk of endometrial cancer and decrease risk of coronary aery disease (as estrogen increases HDL and decreases LDL and triglyceride level). o So for H with estrogen alone the answer of this question will change. In that case it will be option 'a' i. e., increased risk of coronary aery disease.",

The management of severe preeclampsia after 32 weeks is with delivery. Prior to 32 weeks, consideration may be given to expectant management of the patient depending on the clinical circumstances. This patient is at 35 weeks' with headache, visual changes, elevated blood pressures, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver function tests. She, therefore, needs to be delivered. She appears to already be in labor as she is contracting every two minutes and her cervix is dilated and effaced. At this point, magnesium sulfate should be staed. Magnesium sulfate has consistently been demonstrated to be the most effective medication for seizure prophylaxis in women with preeclampsia. To administer oxytocin would not be necessary for this patient. She appears to already be in labor with contractions every two minutes. To discharge the patient would absolutely be incorrect. Severe preeclampsia need to be delivered or, at the very least, admitted to the hospital. There is no role for discharging a patient home in the management of severe preeclampsia.

        "exp": "\"A variety of ovarian neoplasms, both benign and malignant may produce testosterone and lead to virilization. Specifically, women with an abrupt onset, typically within several months, or sudden worsening of virilizing signs should prompt concern for a hormone producing ovarian or adrenal tumor. Symptoms may include deepening of voice, frontal balding, severe acne or hirsutism or both, increased muscle mass and clitoromegaly. Accordingly, serum testosterone levels may be used to exclude these tumors. Free testosterone levels are more sensitive than total testosterone levels as an indicator of hyperandrogenism. Although improving, current free testosterone assays lack a uniform laboratory standard. For this reason, total testostrerone levels remain the best approach for excluding a tumor. Threshold values beyond 200 ng /dl of total testosterone warrant evaluation for an ovarian leison. \" So now I do not need to explain that testosterone estimation is the best investigation in case of rapid onset hirsutism and amennorhea. Lines of Leon Speroff further support the answer- \"A serum testosterone concentration greater than 150 mg/dl identifies almost all woman with a potential androgen producing tumor. However, a tumor still should be suspected and excluded in a woman with rapidly progressive hirsutism or signs and symptoms of virilization, even when the serum testosterone concentration is below the threshold value. \" M/C cause of rapid onset hirsutism in young females = Testosterone producing tumor DHEA sulphate is produced exclusively by the adrenal gland. Therefore, serum DHEAS levels above 700 mcg/dl are highly sensitive for the presence of an adrenal neoplasm. Adrenal imaging with abdominal CT or MRI is indicated for any patient with DHEAS levels that exceed this value.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Fetal Attitude Fetal station: This is the relationship between the presenting pa of the baby- the head, shoulder, buttocks, or feet and two pas of the mother's pelvis called the ischial spines. Normally the ischial spines are the narrowest pa of the pelvis. They are a natural measuring point for the delivery progress. If the presenting pa lies above the ischial spines, the station is repoed as a negative number from -1 to -5 (each number is a centimeter). If the presenting pa lies below the ischial spines, the station is repoed as a positive number from +1 to +5. The baby is said to be \"engaged\" in the pelvis when it is even with the ischial spines at 0 station. Fetal lie: This is the relationship between the head to tailbone axis of the fetus and the head to tailbone axis of the mother. If the two are parallel, then the fetus is said to be in a longitudinal lie. If the two are at 90-degree angles to each other, the fetus is said to be in a transverse lie. Nearly all (99. 5%) fetuses are in a longitudinal lie. Fetal attitude: The fetal attitude describes the relationship of the fetus' body pas to one another. The normal fetal attitude is commonly referred to as the fetal position. The head is tucked down to the chest, with arms and legs drawn in towards the center of the chest. Abnormal fetal attitudes may include a head that is extended back or other body pas extended or positioned behind the back. Abnormal fetal attitudes can increase the diameter of the presenting pa as it passes through the pelvis, increasing the difficulty of bih. Fetal presentation: The presenting pa is defined as the pa of the presentation which overlies the internal os. - Cephalic (head-first) presentation: - Cephalic presentation is considered normal and occurs in about 97% of deliveries. There are different types of cephalic presentation, which depend on the fetal attitude. Rarely, the fetus' head is extended back, and the chin, face, or forehead will present first depending on the degree of extension. This is a more difficult delivery, because this is not the smallest pa of the fetus' head. It may result in a need for cesarean delivery. A cesarean delivery may be recommended for any of the fetal positions other than cephalic. Breech presentation: Breech presentation is considered abnormal and occurs about 3% of the time. A complete breech presentation occurs when the buttocks present first, and both the hips and knees are flexed. A frank breech occurs when the hips are flexed so the legs are straight and completely drawn up toward the chest. Other breech positions occur when either the feet or knees come out first. Shoulder presentation: The shoulder, arm, or trunk may present first if the fetus is in a transverse lie. This type of presentation occurs less than 1% of the time. Transverse lie is more common with premature delivery or multiple pregnancies.",

The sequence of events in oogenesis are: The primitive germ cells undergo mitotic divisions to form oogonia (diploid cells). Oogonium is unique in that it is the only female cell in which both X' chromosomes are active. The oogonia proliferate by mitosis to form primary oocytes (diploid cells). Primary oocytes formed from the oogonia enter a prolonged prophase (diplotene stage) of the first meiotic division and remain in this stage until ovulation occurs after pubey. Primary oocytes completes the first meiotic division at pubey just before ovulation to form secondary oocyte (haploid cell) and 1st polor body. Secondary oocyte immediately begins second meiotic division but this division stops at metaphase and is completed only if the mature ovum (ootid) is feilized with sperm. At that time second polor body (polocyte) is extruded and the feilized ovum proceeds to form a new individual. Feilization normally occurs in the ampulla of fallopian tube.",

More on renal glycosuria during pregnancy Renal glycosuria during pregnancy is not completely benign and these women are at risk for preterm delivery and for the development of fetal macrosomia. Most pregnant patients with renal glycosuria have normal kidney and the abnormality disappears after delivery. In some cases renal glycosuria during pregnancy is a manifestation of renal tubular damage secondary to chronic pyelonephritis. These patients frequently develop UTI. Management of Renal Glycosuria during pregnancy a) Perform frequent urine testing to detect asymptomatic bacteriuria 1)) Instructing the patient to have several small meals per day, rather than three large meals to avoid postprandial elevation in blood sugar and glycosuria c) Staying ale for early signs and symptoms of preterm labour Patiens with renal glycosuria loose as much as 100g/day of glucose in the urine. Such large doses decrease the amount of glucose available for their caloric needs and lipolysis is activated to maximum. This causes production of ketones and tendency towards ketoacidosis.

        "question": "Gynaecomastia is seen in all except: September 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Hypothyroidism Gynecomastia results from an imbalance in hormone levels in which levels of estrogen are increased relative to levels of androgens. Gynecomastia that occurs in normally-growing infant and pubeal boys that resolves on its own with time is known as physiologic gynecomastia. A number of medical conditions may also result in gynecomastia: Malnutrition and re-feeding (recovery from malnutrition) have both been shown to create a hormonal environment that may lead to gynecomastia. Similarly, cirrhosis of the liver alters normal hormone metabolism and may lead to gynecomastia. Disorders of the male sex organs (testes) can result in decreased testosterone production and relatively high estrogen levels, leading to gynecomastia. These disorders may be genetic, such as Klinefelter's syndrome, or acquired due to trauma, infection, reduced blood flow, or aging. Testicular cancers may also secrete hormones that cause gynecomastia. Other conditions that are associated with an altered hormonal environment in the body and may be associated with gynecomastia are chronic renal failure and hypehyroidism. Gynecomastia can also be a side effect of a number of medications. Examples of drugs that can be associated with gynecomastia are listed below: -- Spironolactone- it has anti-androgenic activity; - Calcium channel blockers used to treat hypertension (such as nifedipine); - ACE inhibitor drugs for hypertension (captopril, enalapril); - Some antibiotics (for example, isoniazid, ketoconazole, and metronidazole); - Anti-ulcer drugs (such as ranitidine, cimetidine, and omeprazole); - Anti-androgen or estrogen therapies for prostate cancer; - Methyldopa; - Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAA) for HIV disease, which may cause fat redistribution leading to Pseudogynecomastia or, in some cases, true gynecomastia; - Digitoxin; - Diazepam",
