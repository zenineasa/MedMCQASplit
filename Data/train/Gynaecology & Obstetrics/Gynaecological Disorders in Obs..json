The answer is quite obvious but let's see how other options can be ruled out. Option \"a\" Preterm labor. Points in favor. Points against* Patient is pregnant* Pain in abdomen at 28 weeks (preterm labor is where labor starts before the 37th completed weeks. The lower limit is 28 weeks in developing countries and 20 weeks in developed countries* Preterm labor is diagnosed- When there are regular uterine contractions. (Not acute pain) With or without pain at least in every 10 minutes.- Dilatation of cervix is >2cm- Effacement of cervix =80%- Length of cervix as measured by TVS <2. 5cm and funneling of the internal OS.- Pelvic pressure backache, vaginal discharge, or bleeding. None of the above criteria are being fulfilled* Presence of leukocytosis and fever can also go against it as even if there is intra-amniotic infection causing preterm labor features like--fever, leukocytosis, uterine tenderness, and fetal tachycardia are absent. Rather, if these features are present it means a final stage of uterine infection has reached. And here our patient is having fever, leukocytosis without regular uterine contractions (off and on pair) but with acute pain in abdomen, so it can be ruled out. Option \"b\" Torsion of fibroid. Points in favor. Points against* Patient has fibroid (Though no mention has been made whether it is pedunculated or not, Remember torsion is seen in subserous pedunculated myomas)Q* Patient is complaining of acute pain in abdomen* Torsion is not associated with fever and leukocytosis. Option \"d\" Infection of fibroid. Points in favor. Points against* Presence of fibroid (Remember. Infection is common in submucous fibroids)Q* Fever* Leukocytosis* Acute pain in abdomen (Infection of fibroid will not cause acute pain in abdomen).* Infection of fibroid occurs following abortion or labor (Here patient is pregnant but there is no history of abortion or labor)* Infection causes blood stained discharge (Not seen in this patient). So, from above discussion infection can be kept in +- status. If we have no better option, we can think about it. Option \"c\" i. e. Red degeneration of fibroid is the diagnosis-let's have a look. Red degeneration of fibroid* It is seen mostly during pregnancy and mid pregnancyQ* The myoma suddenly becomes acutely painfulQ, enlarged, Q and tender. Q* Patient presents with:- Acute abdominal painQ- VomitingQ- MalaiseQ- Slight fever.

Explanation: The most frequently altered gene in estrogen-dependent endometrioid endometrial carcinoma is PTEN. In contrast, p53 mutations or Her2/neu overexpression are more frequent in non-endometrioid tumors. K-ras mutations are detected in approximately 15-30% of endometrioid carcinomas. A beta-catenin mutation was detected in about 20% of endometrioid carcinomas. Lynch syndrome, which is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder of cancer susceptibility and is characterized by a MSH2/MSH6 protein complex deficiency, is associated with the development of non- endometrioid carcinomas. Also Know: The genetic mutations most commonly associated with endometrioid adenocarcinoma are in the genes: PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene*. PIK3. CA, a kinase. KRAS, a GTPase that functions in signal transduction. CTNNB1, involved in adhesion and cell signaling. The CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) gene is most commonly mutated in the squamous subtype of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. PROGNOSTIC VARIABLES IN ENDOMETRIAL CAAge: Younger women with endometrial cancer have better prognosis than older women. Histologic Type: Nonendometrioid histologic subtypes account for about 10% of endometrial cancers and carry an increased risk for recurrence and spread. Histologic grade. Tumour size: Significant prognostic factor for lymph node metastasis and survival in patients with endometrial CA. Hormone receptor status: Estrogen and progesterone receptor levels are prognostic indicators, Patients whose tumours are positive for one or both receptors have longer survival times, Progesterone receptors levels appear to be stronger predictors of survival. DNA ploidy and proliferative Index: The proportion of nondiploid tumours increases with stage, lack of tumour differentiation, and depth of myometrial invasion. Myometrial invasion: Increasing depth of invasion is associated with increasing likelihood of extrauterine spread and recurrence. Lymph-vascular space invasion. Isthmus and cervix extension: Involvement of isthmus and cervix is associated with increased risk for extrauterine disease, lymph node metastasis and recurrence. Peritoneal cytology: Seems to have adverse effect on survival only if the endometrial cancer has spread to adnexa, peritoneum, or lymph nodes and not if the disease is otherwise confined to uterus. Lymph node metastases. Intraperitoneal metastases. Molecular aberration. Inactivation of PTEN tumor suppressor gene is one of the earliest aberrations observed and most common genetic defect in Type 1 cancer. Most frequent genetic alteration is TP53 mutation found in Type 2 endometrial cancer.",

Sentinel node is always located in the groin making vulva an ideal site for sentinel node biopsy'. 'The detection of SLN is currently a standard component of the surgical treatment of malignant melanoma, breast cancer and is a promising staging technique for patients with vulvar cancer. In cervical cancer SLN mapping is more recent and preliminary studies indicate that it may be a feasible technique' - 'Trends in Cervical Cancer' by Varaj Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) Biopsy for Gynaecological Malignanciesa. The sentinel lymph node is defined as the first draining lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from the tumor site. A negative sentinel lymph node would thus predict the absence of lymph node metastasis in the entire draining basin. b. Sentinel lymph node evaluation in female genital tract cancers is relatively new and a number of promising studies are under evaluation. c. The concept has shown most promising results in vulvar cancer followed by cervical cancer. d. (SLN is however not yet accepted as a standard procedure for either of these). For endometrial cancer the concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy has been studied by small studies and requires further larger studies. Results from current studies are favorable but not to the same extent as vulvar and cervical cancers. e. For vaginal cancer the concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy is very new and studies are limited mainly to case reports.",

They can be accopanied by: Heart palpitations; Sleep disturbances; Profuse perspiration; Cold chills; Anxiety; Flushing. Hot flashes are: Mainly women over 40 as they transition into menopause as well as pregnant women. Other causes of Hot Flushes: Thyroid disease, epilepsy, autoimmune disorders, insulinomas, pancreatic tumors, leukemias. Hot flushes are waves of vasodilation affecting face & neck last for 2-5 min each more severe during night, disturb sleep. Mechanism: Estrogen deficiency - Reduces hypothalamine endorphine - Release more norepinephrine & serotonin - Leads to inappropriate heat loss mechanism. Hormonal Replacement Therapy: Benefit of HRT for Relief of Symptoms: Hot flashes: Highly effective; Usually required for a relatively short period of time, E. g., 1 to 3 years. Mood disturbance: Improve irritability & anxiety in many menopausal women; Relieve mild depressive symptoms. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is indicated in menopausal women to overcome the short-term and long-term consequences of estrogen deficiency. HRT can be administered orally (in pill form), vaginally (as a cream) or trans dermally (in patch form) because it replaces female hormones produced by the ovaries, hormone replacement therapy minimize menopause symptoms. Used before, during & after menopause. Who needs HRT: Symptomatic women who suffer from estrogen deficiency (Therapeutic); High risk cases for menopausal complications such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, colonic cancer (prophylactic). Premature & surgical menopause; Gonadal dysgenesis in adolescents. Treatment of Hot Flashes: If mild symptoms & signs advised exercise. Initiate low dose HRT if: Moderate or severe symptoms: Non-hormonal treatments have failed; No interest in non-hormonal therapy. Titrate estrogen dosage upward if needed. When estrogen can't be used, offer: SSRI or SNRI; Gabapentin, clonidine, alpha-methyldopa; MPA or Megesterol. Attempt discontinuation after 1-2 years.
