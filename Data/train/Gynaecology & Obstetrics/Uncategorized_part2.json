After ovulation, the estrogens as well as progesterone are synthesized by the luteinized granulosa and theca cells of the corpus luteum, and the pathways of biosynthesis are slightly different.

In most of the books the criteria for diagosis of postmolar gestational trophoblastic tumor is given - Criteria for diagnosis of post molar gestational trophoblastic tumor as prescribed by FIGO oncology committee in 2002 Relapsed (Recurrent), high risk disease is defined by rising hCG after complete serological response to EMA/CO chemotherapy i.e. having atleast 6 weeks of normal hCG values post chemotherapy. Resistant, or refractory, cases are those that have a rising or plateaued hCG while on EMA/CO So by definition Plateau of hCG is seen in resistent and not relapsed cases hence I am chosing it as the option of choice Also know: Management of Recurrent Gestational Trohoblastic neoplasia Diagnosis Careful radiological assessment should be done in such patients to identify the sites of potentially resectable disease FDG -- PET may be used to locate sites of disease in cases showing serological relapse without visible abnormality on conventional imaging. Treatment Treatment is usually surgical resection followed by postoperative chemotherapy. If no site of relapse is identified. hysterectomy should be done as the most likely site of relapse is uterus . The most effective second line chemotherapy is EMA/EP i.e. Etoposide, actinomycins & methotrexate alternating weekly with etoposide and cisplatin This regimen is toxic but has a repoed remission rate of >80% An emerging less toxic alternative is fonightly regimen of paclitaxel + cisplatin alternating with paclitaxel + Etoposide.",

So there is not doubt we can manage the patient medically (i.e. option d - ruled out) Expectant management as explained earlier is not better than medical management as it carries the risk of rupture of ectopic pregnancy (i.e. option C ruled out) and also it is done when riFICG levels are < 1000 IUL Now - The question arises whether we should give single dose MTx or multidose methotrexate treatment. In the trials which have been conducted - No difference was found in treatment duration, phCG levels and side effects in single dose vs multidose methotrexate therapy. Single dose therapy is more commonly used becasue of simplicity. It is less expensive, requires less invasive post therapy monitoring and does not require leucovorin supplementation. One trial has shown that multidose therapy has greater chance of success than single dose but this is not suppoed by any other trial so, single dose methotrexate is being used commonly. (So, it is our option of choice.) Also know : Single dose Medical treatment protocol for ectopic pregnancy.

It is believed that right sided predominance was either genetically determined or due to difference in the vasculature of the ovaries. The anatomical asymmetry between the left and right side are also thought to be the reason. The left ovarian vein drains to the left renal vein and the right ovarian vein to the inferior venacava. The left renal vein is thought to be under high pressure than the right and therefore drain slower.

C: Alkanline Phosphatase The triple test/ triple screen/Kettering test/ Ba's test is an investigation performed during pregnancy in the second trimester to classify a patient as either high-risk or low-risk for chromosomal abnormalities (and neural tube defects). The term \"multiple-marker screening test\" is sometimes used instead. This term can encompass the \"double test\" and \"quadruple test\". A positive test means having a high risk of chromosomal abnormalities (and neural tube defects), and such patients are then referred for more sensitive and specific procedures to receive a definitive diagnosis, mostly invasive procedures like amniocentesis. The Triple test measures serum levels: Alpha-fetoprotein is made in the yolk sac and in the fetal liver, and some amount of AFP gets into the mother's blood. In neural tube defects, the skin of the fetus is not intact and so larger amount of AFP is measured in the mother's blood. In Down syndrome, the AFP is decreased in the mother's blood, presumably because the yolk sac and fetus are smaller than usual. Estriol is a hormone produced by the placenta, using ingredients made by the fetal liver and adrenal gland. Estriol is decreased in the Down syndrome pregnancy. Human chorionic gonadotropin hormone is produced by the placenta, and is used to test for the presence of pregnancy. A specific smaller pa of the hormone, called the beta subunit, is increased in Down syndrome pregnancies.",

First, the local effect of progestin on cervical mucus make it thick and relatively impenetrable to bacteria. Since uterine bleeding is eventually greatly decreased in users of the LNG-IUD (progestin releasing IUD), any retrograde menstruation (which might seed the fallopian tubes with bacteria) should be reduced as well. In addition, decidual changes in the endometrium may make it less susceptible to infection. In other words, progestin-releasing IUDs may mimic the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate against upper-genital-tract infection. Also know : PID is common in non hormonal IUCD. IUCD related bacterial infections are due to contamination of endometrial cavity at the time of inseion. Actinomycosis infection is related to IUCD use. Most common side effect of 1UCD's is increased vaginal bleeding. 2nd most common side effect of IUCD : Pain in Lower back or cramps in lower abdomen.",

They can be distinguished from Baholin's cyst, urethrocele, cystocele and urethral diveiculum by their position, by the fact they do not disappear with pressure or with change of posture and by demonstrating with around or other means that they do not communicate with the bladder or urethra. On the other hand Baholin's cyst arises from Baholin's gland which lies near the junction of middle and posterior third of labia majora therefore the cyst is also found there (not on the junction of lower 1/3 and upper 2/ 3 anterior wall of vagina). Vaginal inclusion cyst (Shaw 14/e, p 122) is mainly seen at lower end of the vagina on its posterior surface and is caused by tags of mucosa embedding inside the scar that later forms a cyst.",

The cervix of the uterus projects into its upper pa and towards its lower end, vagina pierces the urogenital diaphragm and is surrounded by the 2 bulbocavernosus muscles which act as a sphincter (sphincter vaginae). Our question is related to the suppos of vagina. Before going into its details lets have a second look at the options. All the options given in the question are somehow related to vagina therefore may have a role in suppoing vagina except the infundibulopelvic ligaments. l7fundibulopelvic ligament attach the ovary to the lateral pevlic wall and suppoa the ovary, but has no connection to the vagina or uteriiinererore does not suppo either structures.

Intercourse is considered safe during the dry days immediately after the menses initial the mucus is detected. Thereafter the couple must abstain until the fouh day after the peak day. To practice this method, the women should be able to distinguish between different types of mucus. This requires a high degree of motivation.

Early labor ECV - provided there is good amount of liquor amnii and there is no contraindication. ECV should be tried in all cases. LSCS - is the preferred method of delivery if version fails or is contraindicated. ate labor Baby alive - If the baby is mature and fetal condition is good, it is preferable to do LSCS in all cases. Baby dead - LSCS even in such cases, is much safer in the hands of those who are not conversant with destructive operation. If the obstetrician is conversant with destructive operation, decapitation or evisceration is to be done. Following destructive operation, the uterine cavity is to be explored to exclude rupture of uterus. Internal version should not be done. According to Onset of active labor in a woman with a transverse lie is an indication for cesarean delivery. Once labor is well established, attempts at conversion to a longitudnal lie by abdominal manipulation are likely to be unsuccessful. Before labor or early in labor, with the membranes intact, attempts at external version are woh trying in absence of other complications that indicate cesarean section. In the given question 38 weeks primi is presenting in Early labour so external cephalic version could have been tried. but it is not given in the option, so our answer is LSCS.

Causes:Itch due to infections Candida albicans infection (vulvovaginal thrush) is the most impoant microorganism to consider in a postpubeal woman with vulval itch. Bacterial vaginosis causes a frothy, malodorous discharge, and uncommonly causes vulval itch, possibly as a result of contact dermatitis. Genital viral was are often itchy. Pinworms can reside in the vagina or anus and cause itch when they exit at night. Infections that rarely cause vulval itch include cytolytic vaginosis (associated with vaginal lactobacilli) and trichomoniasis. Itch due to an inflammatory skin condition Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common cause of an itchy vulva at all ages. It may be due to diverse causes, including: Age-related prepubeal or postmenopausal lack of oestrogen Underlying tendency to atopic dermatitis Scratching for another reason Friction from skin folds, clothing, activity, or sexual intercourse Moisture due to occlusive underwear Urine and/or faeces Soap or harsh cleanser Frequent washing Inappropriate or unnecessary chemical applications, including over-the-counter or prescribed medications Fissuring of the posterior fourchette Normal, excessive or infected vaginal secretions Severe vulval itch may be due to: Lichen simplex Lichen sclerosus Lichen planus Other common skin disorders that may cause vulval itch include: Psoriasis Seborrhoeic dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis* Irritant or allergic contact uicaria Dermographism Folliculitis *Potential vulval allergens include: Methylisothiazolinone, a preservative in moist wipes Various textile dyes in underwear Fragrance in a douche or antiperspirant Rubber accelerants in condom, menstrual cup or underwear Latex rubber and semen are potential causes of contact uicaria. Itch due to neoplasia Benign and malignant neoplastic disorders of the vulva are often asymptomatic in their early stages, but they can cause itch. The most common cancerous lesions are: Squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL, also known as vulval intraepithelial neoplasia or VIN) Extramammary Paget disease Invasive vulval cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) Itch due to neuropathy",

The Anti D binds to antigen sites on the fetal red cells so that these cells do not mount an immune response, provided the baby is Rh negative and direct coombs test done on baby is negative. If mother's IUT is positive or fetus has positive direct coombs test, it means mother is already immunised. In such cases their is no point in giving anti D. Dose : * Ideally amount of Anti D should be calculated according to the volume of fetomaternal bleed by doing a Kleihauer test. Generally : - Gestational age < 12 weeks - dose is 5Oug - Beyond 12 weeks - dose is 300ug Antepaum prophylaxis : At 28 weeks gestation in a Rh negative patient : Indirect coombs test is done and if antibodies are not detected i.e. patient is unimmunized, Anti D 300ug is given as antepaum prophylaxis. To know the exact amount of feto maternal bleed Kleihauer Betke test is done 300 pg of Anti D will neutralize about 30 ml of feto maternal bleed (i.e. approximately 15 ml of fetal cell).",

        "question": "Ideal contraceptive for lactating mothers is:",
        "exp": "lactational amenorrhoea An almost similar question was asked previously in 'All India' examination. Note that previously 'Most effective' contraceptive was asked. Now the question is different -Ideal' contraceptive is asked. Practically, there are no ideal contraceptives (neither for lactating women, nor for non-lactating women). An Ideal contraceptive is one which is - 100% effective, 100% safe, reversible with no side effects, and minimal effect on lactation. The Barrier methods and Combined OCPs can be easily ruled out; as barrier methods have high failure rates if used alone; while combined OCPs have a negative effect on breast milk production. Lactational amenorrhoea is the most ideal contraceptive for a lactating women, as it has viually no side effects, rather it has plethora of benefits for both mother and child. About effectiveness, it is almost equally effective to Progesterone only pills (POPs) when used perfectly. (see the below given table). Failure rates: Contraceptive method Typical use Perfect use LAM (6 months only) 2.0 0.5 IUD 0.8 0.6 POP 'mini pill' 8.0 0.5 Combined oral contraceptive 6-8 0.1 Barrier method 14 3.0 Lactational amenorrhoea (LAM) is a natural, safe and effective contraceptive method which can be used upto 6 months post paum if the following conditions are met. (Note that LAM is not pure simple exclusive breast feeding; following conditions need to be fulfilled) The mother should not experience vaginal bleeding after the 8 weeks postpaum. The baby is less than 6 months old. The baby is exclusively breastfed. Breast. feeding is done at least every 4 hrs. during the day and every 6 hrs during night. If the above conditions are fulfilled then LAM can give more than 98% protection from pregnancy. It has the added benefit of promoting exclusive breast feeding which is the ideal nutrition for infants. Lactational Amenorrhoea Advantages Disadvantages * Very effective if used perfectly * Can be used only for a sho * Has no side effects period (6 months post paum) * Promotes exclusive breast feeding, and therefore enhances maternal and infant health. * Does not require inseion of any device at the time of sexual intercourse * Can be initiated immediately postpaum * Is economical and requires no commodities or supplies * Reduces mother's lifetime risk of breast cancer. Physiology of LAM: Infant's suckling is the stimulus that initiates the state of lactational amenorrhea for breastfeeding women. The act of suckling elevates prolactin levels, and reduces GnRH from the hypothalamus. This reduces LH release thus inhibiting follicular maturation. This prevents ovulation. But, even with continued nursing, ovulation eventually returns after 6 months, so another method of contraception should be used 6 months postpaum, or sooner if the menses resume. Ovalation has been seen to resume even earlier in some patients, so some books advice 'Rule of 3' i.e. - another contraceptive method should be use along with LAM beginning from the 3rd postpaum month. - and if the women is paially breastfeeding or not breastfeeding, the contraceptive should begin by the 3rd postpaum week. Progesterone only pills are the most effective contraceptive during lactation amongst the options provided. They have drawbacks like: - Have to be taken regularly at the same time - Cause spotting or irregular bleeding, ectopic pregnancy, headache, nausea, acne, hirsuitism and weight gain",

C: Anencephaly There are well-recognised risk factors, such as diabetes, fetal macrosomia,post maturity, multiparity, anencephaly, fetal ascites and maternal obesity, but it is often difficult to predict. A number of obstetrical maneuvers are sequentially performed in attempt to facilitate delivery at this point,including : Gaskin maneuver involves moving the mother to an all fours position with the back arched, widening the pelvic outlet. McRobe's maneuver; Woods' screw maneuver which leads to turning the anterior shoulder to the posterior and vice versa.

They appear as single, red, smooth elongated masses extending from the external os. Polyps vary in size and range from several millimetres to 2 or 3cm. These common growths are found more frequently in multiparas and rarely in prepubeal females. Endocervical polyps are typically asymptomatic, but they can cause metrorrhagia, postcoital bleeding and symptomatic vaginal discharge. They are usually identified by visual inspection during pelvic examination. In some instances, Pap smear findings of atypical glandular cells have been associated with endocervical polyps. Although they are typically benign, but malignant transformation may develop in 1 percent. Impoantly, cervical cancer can present as polypoid masses and can mimic these beinign lesions. For this reason removal and histologic evaluation are recommended for an endocervical polyp. Endocervical polyps are removed by grasping the polyp with a ring or polyp forceps. The polyp is twisted repeatedly about the base of its stalk to strangulate its feeding v essels. With repeated twisting the base will avulse. Monsel solution (ferric subsulfate) can be applied with direct pressure to the resulting stalk stub to complete hemostasis.",

The primitive germ cells take their origin from the yolk sac at about the end of 3rd week and their migration to the developing gonadal ridge is completed round about the end of 4th week. In the female gonads, the germ cells undergo a number of rapid mitotic divisions and differentiate into oogonia. The number of oogonia reaches its maximum at 20th week, numbering about 7 million. While the majority of the oogonia continue to divide, some enter into the prophase of the first meiotic division and are called primary oocytes. These are surrounded by flat cells and are called primordial follicles and are present in the coex of the ovary. At bih, there is no more mitotic division and all the oogonia are replaced by primary oocytes which have finished the prophase of the first meiotic division and remain in resting phase (dictyotene stage) between prophase and metaphase. Total number of primary oocytes at bih is estimated to be about 2 million. The primary oocytes do not finish the first meiotic division until pubey is reached. At pubey, some 400,000 primary oocytes are left behind, the rest being atretic. Out of these, some 400 are likely to ovulate during the entire reproductive period.",

Sholy before pubey. the primordial germ cells develop into sperrnatogonia in the wall of seminiferous tubules. Meiosis is a special type of cell division that reduces the diploid number of chromosomes (i.e., 46) to the haploid number of 23. It takes place only in germ cells; to give rise to gametes (sperms and egg cells) It involves two meiotic cell divisions, meiosis I and meiosis II. The first metotic division is a reduction division because the chromosome number is reduced from diploid (46) to haploid (23). The 2nd meiotic division is similar to mitosis as daughter cells formed contain the same haploid number of chromosomes as the mother cell. Thus. though nation 'a' and both are correct but reduction division occurs when primary spermatocyte is transformed to secondary spermatocyte, so it is the answer of choice. Extra Edae : The developmental process from spermatogonium to sperm takes about 61 daysdeg and the entire process, including the transit time in the ductal system takes approximately three months.deg Clinical significance The above fact is clinically significant, as in case of male factor infeility a repeat semen analysis to see the sperm count, motility etc. after giving treatment should be ;,,ne three months the first analysis (as new sperms will be formed after 3 months).",

Women with mutation in BRCA I and BRCA II have higher risk of developing fallopian tube carcinoma (therefore, a prophylactic surgery in these women should include a complete removal of both tubes along with the ovaries). Most common symptom is Vaginal discharge Went watery vaginal discharge called as Hvdrop, Later due to ulceration - watery discharge becomes blood stained and may take the form of perimenopausal/ postmenopausal bleeding.

All other X chromosomes present in a cell may be seen as X-chromatin bodies in a resting nucleus.

The pararectal fossa is formed by lateral reflections of perineum over the superior one third of the rectum; this space gives the rectum room to fill with feces.

        "exp": "This patient's condition is a classic third trimester complication referred to as toxemia of pregnancy, or preeclampsia. It occurs in 6% of all pregnancies but is more frequent in primiparas. Although the pathogenesis is still unclear, the first event appears to be placental ischemia, probably due to abnormalities in the trophoblast and alterations in the maturation of placental vessels. The trophoblast of invading placental vessels fails to acquire the characteristics of normal endothelial cells, with subsequent alterations in blood flow. Placental ischemia then triggers the release of thromboplastic substances, increases renin synthesis, and reduces prostaglandin E levels. Chorioamnionitis is an infection of chorioamniotic membranes due to bacteria that ascend through the vaginal canal. This is an impoant cause of spontaneous aboion in the second and third trimester, but it plays no role in the pathogenesis of toxemia of pregnancy. The release of thromboplastic substances may cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Increased renin and reduced prostaglandin E mediate increased sensitivity to angiotensin, leading to maternal hypeension.",

        "question": "Ideal contraceptive for lactating mothers is aEUR'",
        "exp": "Lactational amenorrhoea An almost similar question was asked previously in 'All India' examination. Note that previously 'Most effective' contraceptive was asked. Now the question is different -Ideal' contraceptive is asked. Practically, there are no ideal contraceptives (neither for lactating women, nor for non-lactating women). An Ideal contraceptive is one which is - 100% effective, 100% safe, reversible with no side effects, and minimal effect on lactation. The Barrier methods and Combined OCPs can be easily ruled out; as barrier methods have high failure rates if used alone, while combined OCPs have a negative effect on breast milk production. Lactational amenorrhoea is the most ideal contraceptive for a lactating women, as it has viually no side effects, rather it has plethora of benefits for both mother and child. About effectiveness, it is almost equally effective to Progesterone only pills (POPs) when used perfectly. (see the below table) Failure rates: Contraceptive method Typical use Perfect use LAM (6 months only) 2.0 0.5 IUD 0.8 0.6 POP 'mini pill' 8.0 0.5 Combined oral contraceptive 6-8 0.1 Barrier method 14 3.0 Lactational amenorrhoea (LAM) is a natural, safe and effective contraceptive method which can be used upto 6 months post paum if the following conditions are met. (Note that LAM is not pure simple exclusive breast feeding; following conditions need to be fulfilled) I. The mother should not experience vaginal bleeding after the 8 weeks postpaum. The baby is less than 6 months old. The baby is exclusively breastfed. Breast feeding is done at least every 4 hrs. during the day and every 6 hrs during night. If the above conditions are fulfilled then LAM can give more than 98% protection from pregnancy. It has the added benefit of promoting exclusive breast feeding which is the ideal nutrition for infants. Lactational Amenorrhoea Advantages Disadvantages * Very effective if used perfectly * Can be used only for a sho period * Has no side effects (6 months post paum) * Promotes exclusive breast feeding, and therefore enhances maternal and infant health. * Does not require inseion of any device at the time of sexual intercourse * Can be initiated immediately postpaum * Is economical and requires no commodities or supplies * Reduces mother's lifetime risk of breast cancer. Physiology of LAM: Infant's suckling is the stimulus that initiates the state of lactational amenorrhea for breastfeeding women. The act of suckling elevates prolactin levels, and reduces GnRH from the hypothalamus. This reduces LH release thus inhibiting .follicular maturation. This prevents ovulation. But, even with continued nursing, ovulation eventually returns after 6 months, so another method of contraception should be used 6 months postpaum, or sooner if the menses resume. Ovalation has been seen to resume even earlier in some patients, so some books advice 'Rule of 3' i.e. - another contraceptive method should be use along with LAM beginning from the 3rd postpaum month. - and if the women is paially breastfeeding or not breastfeeding, the contraceptive should begin by the 3rd postpaum week. Progesterone only pills are the most effective contraceptive during lactation amongst the options provided. They have drawbacks like: - Have to be taken regularly at the same time - Cause spotting or irregular bleeding, ectopic pregnancy, headache, nausea, acne, hirsuitism and weight gain",

B: Sever Anemia Delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in full-term neonates for a minimum of 2 minutes following bih is beneficial to the newborn in giving improved hematocrit, iron status as measured by ferritin concentration and stored iron, as well as a reduction in the risk of anemia.This is beneficial only in full term mature baby and may be deleterious to a preterm or low bih baby due to hypervolemia. Negative effects of delayed cord clamping include an increased risk of polycythemia.

Right handedness is more common in population It is believed that right sided predominance was either genetically determined or due to differences in vasculature of the ovaries. The anatomical asymmetry between the left and right side are also thought to be the reason. Ovulation In the primate, it is suggested that ovulations occur with equal frequency in the left and right ovary. In the humans, there is some controversy about the frequency of ovulation on either side It is believed that in normally menstruating women, ovulation was significantly higher in right ovary. It is believed that right sided predominance was either genetically determined or due to differences in vasculature of the ovaries. The anatomical asymmetry between the left and right side are also thought to be the reason. The left ovarian vein drains to the left renal vein and the right ovarian vein to the IVC. The left renal vein is thought to be under pressure than the right and therefore drain slower. Because the left ovary drain slower, the collapsed follicle (corpus leuteum) takes longer to clean and thereby diminishes the chances that ovulation will occur on that side the following month.

Cerebral edema and laryngeal edema, hemolysis and hepatic infarction, and hepatic rupture and renal coical necrosis can all be complications of preeclampsia, but are not the most common causes of maternal moality. Convulsions and renal tubular necrosis can be complications of preeclampsia, but convulsions indicate that eclampsia has developed.

These drugs stimulate contraction of the uterine muscle, helping to control PPH. Oxytoc in Produces rhythmic uterine contractions, can stimulate the gravid uterus, and has vasopressive and antidiuretic effects. Can be used to control postpaum bleeding or hemorrhage. Some suggest its prophylactic use in the third stage of labour. Ergotmetrine Acts directly on uterine smooth muscle, causing a sustained tetanic uterotonic effect that reduces uterine bleeding and shoens the third stage of labor. Administer IM or intramyometrially during puerperium, during delivery of placenta, or after delivering anterior shoulder Prostaglandin Analogue Carboprost-Prostaglandin similar to F2-alpha, but it has a longer duration and produces myometrial contractions that induce hemostasis at the placentation site, which reduces postpaum bleeding. Misoprostol- Synthetic prostaglandin E 1 analog. Ergonovine Used to prevent and treat PPH due to uterine atony by producing firm contraction of the uterus within minutes.

The magnitude of the increases varies according to the size of woman, the number of pregnancies she has had, the number of infants she has delivered, and whether there is one or multiple fetuses. The increases in blood volume progress until term; the average increase in volume at term is 45-50%. The increase is needed for extra blood flow to the uterus, extra metabolic needs of fetus and increased perfusion of others organs, especially kidneys. Extra volume also compensate for maternal blood loss delivery. Plasma volume increases during pregnancy.
