The primitive germ cells take their origin from the yolk sac at about the end of 3rd week and their migration to the developing gonadal ridge is completed round about the end of 4th week. In the female gonads, the germ cells undergo a number of rapid mitotic divisions and differentiate into oogonia. The number of oogonia reaches its maximum at 20th week, numbering about 7 million. While the majority of the oogonia continue to divide, some enter into the prophase of the first meiotic division and are called primary oocytes. These are surrounded by flat cells and are called primordial follicles and are present in the coex of the ovary. At bih, there is no more mitotic division and all the oogonia are replaced by primary oocytes which have finished the prophase of the first meiotic division and remain in resting phase (dictyotene stage) between prophase and metaphase. Total number of primary oocytes at bih is estimated to be about 2 million. The primary oocytes do not finish the first meiotic division until pubey is reached. At pubey, some 400, 000 primary oocytes are left behind, the rest being atretic. Out of these, some 400 are likely to ovulate during the entire reproductive period.",

Werentiation into spermatoznq (or sperms) is called as spermatogenesis. Sholy before pubey. the primordial germ cells develop into sperrnatogonia in the wall of seminiferous tubules. Meiosis is a special type of cell division that reduces the diploid number of chromosomes (i. e., 46) to the haploid number of 23. It takes place only in germ cells; to give rise to gametes (sperms and egg cells) It involves two meiotic cell divisions, meiosis I and meiosis II. The first metotic division is a reduction division because the chromosome number is reduced from diploid (46) to haploid (23). The 2nd meiotic division is similar to mitosis as daughter cells formed contain the same haploid number of chromosomes as the mother cell. Thus. though nation 'a' and both are correct but reduction division occurs when primary spermatocyte is transformed to secondary spermatocyte, so it is the answer of choice.

These pouches are the two lowest extents of the peritoneal cavity, so to answer this question, you just need to decide which one goes lower. Since the uterus is folded over the bladder, the rectouterine pouch can extend to a slightly lower level than the vesicouterine pouch, which makes rectouterine pouch the correct answer. The pararectal fossa is formed by lateral reflections of perineum over the superior one third of the rectum; this space gives the rectum room to fill with feces.

It occurs in 6% of all pregnancies but is more frequent in primiparas. Although the pathogenesis is still unclear, the first event appears to be placental ischemia, probably due to abnormalities in the trophoblast and alterations in the maturation of placental vessels. The trophoblast of invading placental vessels fails to acquire the characteristics of normal endothelial cells, with subsequent alterations in blood flow. Placental ischemia then triggers the release of thromboplastic substances, increases renin synthesis, and reduces prostaglandin E levels. Chorioamnionitis is an infection of chorioamniotic membranes due to bacteria that ascend through the vaginal canal. This is an impoant cause of spontaneous aboion in the second and third trimester, but it plays no role in the pathogenesis of toxemia of pregnancy. The release of thromboplastic substances may cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Increased renin and reduced prostaglandin E mediate increased sensitivity to angiotensin, leading to maternal hypertension.",

Sites that endometriosis is most often found are, ovarian, pelvic peritoneum, anterior and posterior cul-de-sac, uterosacral, round, and broad ligaments, and fallopian tubes. An ectopic pregnancy is one that develops at any site other than the endometrium. Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy are abdominal pain possible a missed period, abnormal bleeding at the time of presentation is not uncommon.

        "exp": "Lactational amenorrhoea An almost similar question was asked previously in 'All India' examination. Note that previously 'Most effective' contraceptive was asked. Now the question is different -Ideal' contraceptive is asked. Practically, there are no ideal contraceptives (neither for lactating women, nor for non-lactating women). An Ideal contraceptive is one which is - 100% effective, 100% safe, reversible with no side effects, and minimal effect on lactation. The Barrier methods and Combined OCPs can be easily ruled out; as barrier methods have high failure rates if used alone, while combined OCPs have a negative effect on breast milk production. Lactational amenorrhoea is the most ideal contraceptive for a lactating women, as it has viually no side effects, rather it has plethora of benefits for both mother and child. About effectiveness, it is almost equally effective to Progesterone only pills (POPs) when used perfectly. (see the below table) Failure rates: Contraceptive method Typical use Perfect use LAM (6 months only) 2. 0 0. 5 IUD 0. 8 0. 6 POP 'mini pill' 8. 0 0. 5 Combined oral contraceptive 6-8 0. 1 Barrier method 14 3. 0 Lactational amenorrhoea (LAM) is a natural, safe and effective contraceptive method which can be used upto 6 months post paum if the following conditions are met. (Note that LAM is not pure simple exclusive breast feeding; following conditions need to be fulfilled) I. The mother should not experience vaginal bleeding after the 8 weeks postpaum. The baby is less than 6 months old. The baby is exclusively breastfed. Breast feeding is done at least every 4 hrs. during the day and every 6 hrs during night. If the above conditions are fulfilled then LAM can give more than 98% protection from pregnancy. It has the added benefit of promoting exclusive breast feeding which is the ideal nutrition for infants. Lactational Amenorrhoea Advantages Disadvantages * Very effective if used perfectly * Can be used only for a sho period * Has no side effects (6 months post paum) * Promotes exclusive breast feeding, and therefore enhances maternal and infant health. * Does not require inseion of any device at the time of sexual intercourse * Can be initiated immediately postpaum * Is economical and requires no commodities or supplies * Reduces mother's lifetime risk of breast cancer. Physiology of LAM: Infant's suckling is the stimulus that initiates the state of lactational amenorrhea for breastfeeding women. The act of suckling elevates prolactin levels, and reduces Gn. RH from the hypothalamus. This reduces LH release thus inhibiting. follicular maturation. This prevents ovulation. But, even with continued nursing, ovulation eventually returns after 6 months, so another method of contraception should be used 6 months postpaum, or sooner if the menses resume. Ovalation has been seen to resume even earlier in some patients, so some books advice 'Rule of 3' i. e. - another contraceptive method should be use along with LAM beginning from the 3rd postpaum month. - and if the women is paially breastfeeding or not breastfeeding, the contraceptive should begin by the 3rd postpaum week. Progesterone only pills are the most effective contraceptive during lactation amongst the options provided. They have drawbacks like: - Have to be taken regularly at the same time - Cause spotting or irregular bleeding, ectopic pregnancy, headache, nausea, acne, hirsuitism and weight gain",

B: Sever Anemia Delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in full-term neonates for a minimum of 2 minutes following bih is beneficial to the newborn in giving improved hematocrit, iron status as measured by ferritin concentration and stored iron, as well as a reduction in the risk of anemia. This is beneficial only in full term mature baby and may be deleterious to a preterm or low bih baby due to hypervolemia. Negative effects of delayed cord clamping include an increased risk of polycythemia. Early clamping should be done in cases of Rh-incompatibility (to prevent antibody transfer from the mother to the baby) or babies born to asphyxiated or one of a diabetic mother.",

Cerebral edema and laryngeal edema, hemolysis and hepatic infarction, and hepatic rupture and renal coical necrosis can all be complications of preeclampsia, but are not the most common causes of maternal moality. Convulsions and renal tubular necrosis can be complications of preeclampsia, but convulsions indicate that eclampsia has developed.

The magnitude of the increases varies according to the size of woman, the number of pregnancies she has had, the number of infants she has delivered, and whether there is one or multiple fetuses. The increases in blood volume progress until term; the average increase in volume at term is 45-50%. The increase is needed for extra blood flow to the uterus, extra metabolic needs of fetus and increased perfusion of others organs, especially kidneys. Extra volume also compensate for maternal blood loss delivery. Plasma volume increases during pregnancy. The rate of increase almost parallels to that of blood volume but the maximum is reached to the extent of 50%. Total plasma volume increases to the extent of 1. 25 litres.",

The mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant. Strategies for prevention of hereditary ovarian cancer \u2022 Genetic testing for susceptibility to ovarian cancer is rapidly becoming integrated into the clinical practice of oncology. Strategies have been adopted to reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer in patient with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations. a. Prophylactic oophorectomy: \"The only proven way to prevent ovarian cancer is surgical oophorectomy. As another possible site of disease among these high risk patients is fallopian tube therefore should be removed. IN BRCA 1 or BRCA-2 mutation carriers, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BS0) may be performed on either completion of childbearing or at age 35. In these patients, the procedure is approximately 90% effective in preventing epithelial ovarian cancer. In women with HNPCC, the risk reduction approaches 100%. \" \u2022 Additional benefit of prophylactic oophorectomy is that the risk of breast cancer is reduced by 50-80%. b. Oral contraceptive pills: \u2022 Data received from a multicenter control of genetic screening centers indicates that the use of oral contraceptive pill is associated with 50% decreased risk for developing ovarian cancer in women who have mutation in either in BRCA - 1 or BRCA - 2. However there is short term increased risk of developing breast cancer. c. Role of screening with CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound: \"In BRCA1- BRCA2 mutation carriers who donot wish to undergo prophylactic surgery a combination of through pelvic examination, transvaginal sonographic examination and CA125 blood testing should be done\". \u2022 Best method of prevention: Prophylactic hysterectomy and BSO at 35 years or as soon as family is complete. \u2022 2nd line: OCP's + screening \u2022 Screening: TVS + Ca 125 started at 35 years and done every 6 or 12 months, breast screening by MRI and mamography at 30 years done annually.",

        "exp": "All of these hormones are produced by the placenta, but h. CG is the hormone that maintains the corpus luteum of pregnancy. The synthesis and secretion of h. CG begins about day 6 of pregnancy, presumably from the trophoblast cells. Pregnancy tests utilize the measurement of h. CG for detection of the embryo. Endothelial growth factor (EGF) is synthesized by the cytotrophoblast cells in the early placenta, then is synthesized by the syncytiotrophoblast cells later (6-8 week old placenta). EGF maintains the trophoblasts. Relaxin is synthesized by decidual cells at the time of paurition and acts to \"soften\" the cervix and pelvic ligaments. IGF act similarly to EGF by stimulating differentiation of the cytotrophoblast cells. HCS(Human chorionic somatotropin) is synthesized by syncytiotrophoblast cells and will promote general growth. It is essential in the stimulation of mammary duct proliferation in development of the breast during pregnancy. Ref: Cunningham F. G., Leveno K. J., Bloom S. L., Hauth J. C., Rouse D. J., Spong C. Y.

Human papilloma virus is a non enveloped DNA virus with a protein capsid It is epihelio tropic and has high affinity for lower ano genital tract. Maximum age of incidence of HPV is under 25 years. Viral Life Cycle: The HPV genome consist of early genes (E) and late genes (L). Early genes are expressed most strongly within the basal and parabasal layers. The late genes encoding capsid proteins are expressed later in superficial layers. Intact virus is shed within superficial squama. Late genes are not strongly expressed in high grade neoplastic lesions. Transmission * It is transmitted by sexual contact with genital skin, mucus membrane or body fluids of a paner with either was or subclinical infection. Congenital HPV infection by veical transmission from mother to infant develops rarely. Conjunctival, laryngeal, vulvar or peineal was present at bih are most likely due to perinatal exposure to maternal HPV in absence of sexual abuse. Infection is not related to the presence of maternal genital was or route of delivery. So caesarean delivery is recommended only in case of large genital was that would obstruct delivery or avulse with cervical dilation. Diagnosis: is made by the direct detection of HPV DNA. This can be done histologically by in situ hybridization, by nucleic acid amplification PCR; or by hybrid capture (HC) technique. Currently, Hybrid capture 2 is the most common technique in clinical use. It is a chemiluminescent test that uses a mixture of RNA probes for the detection of 13 oncogenic HPV types.",

On fuher questioning, the woman also repos urinary frequency, constipation, pain with intercourse and bloating. On physical examination, a large mass is felt in the pelvic area. Follow-up ultrasound examination demonstrates that the mass involves the right adnexa and is composed of multiloculated cystic spaces. Prior to sending the patient to surgery, the primary care physician wants to order a serum tumor marker to screen for ovarian cancer. Which of the following would be the best choice?",
        "exp": "The diagnosis of ovarian cancer is often delayed, because symptoms often do not occur until late in the disease when the mass is large and applies pressure to other abdominal organs. The symptoms illustrated in the case are typical. Patients may also develop ascites with shoness of breath, a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms related to impaired motility secondary to pressure, and, if the ovarian cancer is a type that secretes hormones, menstrual irregularities or abnormal hair growth. The most widely studied tumor marker in ovarian cancer is CA-125. This marker is not of paicular use in screening of the general population for two reasons: 1) small cancers often do not cause serum elevations of the marker; and 2) serum levels of the marker can be elevated by a variety of cancers (including those of ovary, breast, pancreas, colon, and lung) and benign conditions (including endometriosis, pregnancy, liver disease, and congestive heart failure). However, if there is already a strong suspicion or a known history of ovarian cancer, CA-125 can be helpful in establishing if the cancer burden (if present) is large, and whether following the CA-125 levels following surgery can be used to monitor for recurrent disease. While small tumors are not always picked up (50% of women with small ovarian cancers have normal CA-125), more than 80% of women with advanced ovarian cancer have CA-125 elevations. Adrenocoicotropic hormone can be elevated in ectopic hormone-producing lung cancers. Galactosyltransferase can be elevated in a wide variety of cancers, including those from lung, breast, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and colon. It is not used as a marker for ovarian cancer. S-100 is a marker for melanoma and neuroendocrine tumors.",

Mifepristone, is an analogue of the progestin \"norethindrone\". which has strong affinity for progesterone receptors but acts as an antagonist of progesterone. Given alone, the drug was moderately useful in causing aboion of early pregnancy, however the combination of mifepristone with analogue of prostaglandin E, i. e. misoprostol is very effective. hegimen: FDA approved protocol - (Original protocol): 600 mg of Mifepristone (i. e. 3 tablets) given orally on day 1 followed 2 days later by oral misoprostol 400 pg (2 tablets) on day 3. The treatment should be staed no more than 49 days from the sta of the last menstrual period. But according to the recent protocol: 200 mg of mifepristone (it is as effective as 600 mg of mifepristone) is given orally on Day 1 followed 2 days later by vaginal misoprostol 800 pg. ibis regime provides highest efficacy within 63 bays of amenorrhea. Role of mifepristone in Medical aboion: Mifepristone blocks progesterone receptors in the endometrium which leads to disruption of the embryo. production of prostaglandins and a decrease in human chorionic gonadotropin levels. The success rate is dependant on the length of pregnancydeg - the more dependant the pregnancy is on progesterone from the corpus luteum, the more likely that the progesterone antagonist, mifepristone will result in aboion. The production of prostaglandins leads to softening of the cervix as well.

It is chemically similar to tamoxifen Clomiphene is a non steroidal triphenylethylene derivative which demonstrates both estrogen agonist and antagonist propeies (predominant). It is the agent of choice for women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea having sufficient ovarian function to maintain estrogen at a serum level of 40pg/ml. Patient selection: Normal gonadotropicdeg normoprolactinemicdeg patients with normal cycle with absent or infrequent ovulation. deg PCOSdeg Post pill amenorrhea. deg Dose: Initial dose of 25 to 50mgdeg is given daily from D2 - D 5. Ovulation is expected to occur about 5 - 7 days after the last day of therapy. If ovulation doesnot occur, dose is increased in 50mg steps to a maximum of 250mg daily. (Although doses > 100 mg /day are not approved by FDA). Therapy is in given for 4-6 cycles. Clomiphene will be successful in inducing ovulation in about 70% of women, with ovaries producing estrogen Switch over from clomiphene to more aggressive therapy is done when: There is no response to clomiphenedeg (even with 100 mg / day dosing). There is ovulatory response to clomiphene but no pregnancydeg (following 3 to 6 months of ovulatory response to clomiphene). Patients with pituitary insufficiencydeg These patients usually respond to Gonadotropins. Note: Letrozole - 2. 5mg (non steroidal aromatase inhibitor) is found superior to clomiphene. 2. Gonadotropin therapy: Prerequisite for Gonadotropin therapy: Ovarian reserve must be present. The Gonadotropins used are Human menopausal Gonodotropin: -- It is a formulation containing equal amounts of FSH and LH (751U each). -- It is prepared from hormones obtained from urine of postmenopausal women. HCG is required as an ovulatory trigger. FSH: purified urinary FSH and Recombinant FSH are also available. 3. Gonadotropin releasing hormone: Pulsatile Gn. RH: If other methods have failed then pulsatile Gn. RH is needed in patients with anovulation and hypothalamic insufficiency. Other drugs which can be used to for ovulation: Bromocriptine/Cabergoline: Are used to to treat anovulation caused by increase in serum prolactin level. Coicosteroids: Use to treat anovulation due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Also know: Mangement of unilateral proximal tubal block: Hysteroscopic cannulation or microsurgical tubo cornual anastomosis (if any periadenaxal adhesions are also present). Management of distal tubal block: Best is IVF. Surgical procedures like fimbrioplasty (lysis of fimbrial adhesions or dilatation of fimbrial stenosis) or neosalpingostomy may be done. Management of distal tubal block by hydrosalperix First laparoscopic salpingectomy followed by IVF Management of Bipolar tubal obstruction i. e. both proximal and distal tubal obstruction. Best is IVF Extra Edge: Lets quickly revise the tests for tubal patency. Tests for tubal patency: Rubins test: Outdateddeg Hysterosalpingography: screening procedure. deg Hystero contrastosonography Laparoscopy: Best technique for diagnosis of tubal and peritoneal pathology. deg Selective salpingography and falloscopy For evaluation of proximal tube obstruction.

        "question": "During early pregnancy, the trophoblastic cells secrete which of the following hormones in order to maintain the corpus luteum?",
        "exp": "At approximately the midpoint of the menstrual cycle, the ovum is expelled. Once this occurs, the surrounding granulosa and theca cells undergo luteinization and begin to secrete a large amount of estrogen and progesterone. This mass of hormone secreting cells is known as the corpus luteum (because of its yellow color). If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum will persist for 14 days, after which point it degenerates. With the degeneration of the corpus luteum, hormone levels drop, the endometrium sloughs, and menstruation occurs. If a pregnancy does occur, the trophoblastic cells of the pregnancy will secrete human chorionic gonadotropin (h. CG). This hormone goes to the corpus luteum and prevents its degradation, signaling it to continue its excretion of estrogen and progesterone to maintain an environment that is orable for pregnancy. The presence of human chorionic gonadotropin forms the basis for the urine and serum pregnancy test. h. CG steadily increases over the first several weeks of the pregnancy, reaching a peak at approximately 10 weeks. After that, h. CG levels decrease gradually during the remainder of the pregnancy. During early pregnancy, most women experience some nausea. One of the leading theories for the cause of this nausea is the hormone h. CG, because the nausea of early pregnancy appears to mirror the rise and fall of the h. CG levels--peaking at roughly 10 weeks and improving after that. Note: Estrogen and progesterone are produced by the corpus luteum during early pregnancy. The corpus luteum does not degenerate in a pregnant woman, as it does in the nonpregnant woman, because the trophoblastic cells secrete human chorionic gonadotropin (h. CG). After the first months of pregnancy, the placenta takes over the role of secreting the large amounts of estrogen and progesterone that are needed to continue a healthy pregnancy. Once the placenta has taken over this role, the corpus luteum degenerates. Luteinizing hormone (LH) is produced by the anterior pituitary gland. Its rate of secretion is controlled mainly by the hypothalamus, through hypothalamic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH, also called Gn. RH) secretion. The LH surge, which occurs roughly at the midpoint of the menstrual cycle, appears to cause ovulation, which occurs approximately 24 hours after the surge. LH also appears to induce the theca and granulosa cells to become the corpus luteum. Also Know: Chorionic gonadotropin is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 36, 000 to 40, 000 Da. It has the highest carbohydrate content of any human hormone--30 percent. Although h. CG is produced almost exclusively in the placenta, it also is synthesized in fetal kidney. The intact h. CG molecule is detectable in plasma of pregnant women 7 to 9 days after the midcycle surge of LH that precedes ovulation. Thus, it is likely that h. CG enters maternal blood at the time of blastocyst implantation. Plasma levels increase rapidly, doubling every 2 days, with maximal levels being attained at 8 to 10 weeks. Ref: Cunningham F.

The difference between these two types of aboion is of fundamental impoance. The lack of development of fetal structures defines a subset of aboions of genetic origin. In contrast, the early interruption of fetal life is a complex phenomenon with multiple etiologies.

Follicular Phase Through the influence of a rise in (FSH), five to seven teiary-stage ovarian follicles are recruited for entry into the next menstrual cycle. One (or occasionally two) dominant follicles will continue to maturity and secrete increasing amounts of estradiol which initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium Ovulation When the egg has matured, it secretes enough estradiol to trigger the acute release of (LH). In the average cycle this LH surge stas around cycle 12th day and may last 48 hours and leads to ovulation. At the time of ovulation, the cervical mucus is thin and has the propey of great elasticity and this is called spinnbarkeiti thread test under estrogenic activity. When viewed under the microscope, the mucus shows characteristic pattern of fern formation, which is due to presence of sodium chloride in the mucus secreted under estrogenic effect. Luteal phase After ovulation, the residual follicle transforms into the corpus luteum. This corpus luteum will produce Progesterone in addition to estrogens for approximately the next 2 weeks. Progesterone plays a vital role in conveing the proliferative endometrium into a secretory lining receptive for implantation and suppoive of the early pregnancy. It raises the body temperature. Hormonal control Gonadal Estradiol peaks twice, during follicular growth and during the luteal phase. Progesterone remains viually absent prior to ovulation, but becomes critical in the luteal phase and during pregnancy. Many tests for ovulation check for the presence of progesterone. After ovulation the corpus luteum which develops from the burst follicle and remains in the ovary secretes both estradiol and progesterone. Hypothalamus and pituitary These sex hormones come under the influence of the pituitary gland, and both FSH and LH play necessary roles: FSH stimulates immature follicles in the ovaries to grow. LH triggers ovulation. The Gonadotropin releasing hormone of the hypothalamus controls the pituitary, yet both the pituitary and the hypothalamus receive feedback from the follicle.",

        "question": "Estrogen administration in a menopausal woman increases the",
        "exp": "Ans. is c i. e Bone mass Before seeing any Reference for the Question let's rule out some options. Estrogen administration will exe a negative feedback on gonadotropin secretion and decreases Gonadotropin secretion rather than increasing it (Option 'a' ruled out). As I have already discussed in previous Question -Estrogen decreases LDL and not increases it (ruling out Option `b). Now we are left with 2 options, Option 'c' i. e. Bone mass and Option 'rile. Muscle mass. Estrogen given as hormone replacement therapy is most beneficial in preventing osteoporosis i. e it must be increasing bone mass. So, Option 'c'seems to be correct. Now have a look what texts have to say: Estrogen helps to maintain bone mass and skeletal integrity thereby protecting against osteoporosis. Effect of estrogen on bones: Estrogen causes increased osteoblastic activity in the bones. It is impoant in maintaining bone mass primarily by retarding bone resorption. The major action of estrogen is directed at reducing the maturation and activity of osteoclasts, by modifying regulatory cytokine signals from osteoblasts. The action of estrogen and progesterone result in increased expression of bone matrix proteins such as osteonectin, osteocalcin, collagen and alkaline phosphatase. Extra Edge: An overveiw of osteoporosis Risk factors for osteoporosis Non modifiable Modifiable Associated Medical Conditions * Age * Race (caucasian, asian) * Small body frame * Early menopause * Prior fracture * Family history of osteoporosis Inadequate intake of calcium and vitamin D Smoking Low body weight Excess alcohol use Sedentary lifestyle Hypehyroidism Hyperparathyroidism Chronic renal disease Conditions requiring systemic coicosteroid use Diagnosis: Bone Mineral Density Measurement (BMD) Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) of hip and spine is the primary technique for BMD assessment. BMD is expressed as a T score, which is the number of standard detions from the mean for a young healthy woman. A T score above --1 is considered normal, a value between --1 and --2. 5 denotes osteopenia and a score below --2. 5 indicates osteoporosis. Evaluation of BMD by DXA is recommended for all women aged 65 and older, regardless of risk factors and for younger postmenopausal women with 1 or more risk factors.

Classification Most endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas Endometrial carcinomas can be classified into two pathogenetic groups: Type I: These cancers occur most commonly in pre- and peri-menopausal women, often with a history of unopposed estrogen exposure and/or endometrial hyperplasia. They are often minimally invasive into the underlying uterine wall, are of the low-grade endometrioid type, and carry a good prognosis. Type II: These cancers occur in older, post-menopausal women, and are not associated with increased exposure to estrogen. They are typically of the high-grade endometrioid, papillary serous or clear cell types, and carry a generally poor prognosis Risk factors High levels of estrogen Endometrial hyperplasia Polycystic ovary syndrome Nulliparity Infeility Early menarche Late menopause Endometrial polyps or other benign growths of the uterine lining Tamoxifen Hyperplasia Pelvic radiation therapy Breast cancer Ovarian cancer Clinical evaluation A Pap smear may be either normal or show abnormal cellular changes. Endometrial curettage is the traditional diagnostic method. If endometrial curettage does not yield sufficient diagnostic material, a dilation and curettage (D and C) is necessary for diagnosing the cancer. Endometrial biopsy or aspiration may assist the diagnosis. Transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal Pathology The most common finding is a well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which is composed of numerous, small, crowded glands with varying degrees of nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and stratification. Fuher evaluation Colonoscopy is recommended due to the etiologic factors common to both endometrial cancer and colon cancer. Staging Endometrial carcinoma is surgically staged using the FIGO cancer staging system. i a. Stage IA: tumor is limited to the endometrium i b. Stage IB: invasion of less than half the myometrium i c. Stage IC: invasion of more than half the myometrium ii a. Stage IIA: endocervical glandular involvement only ii b. Stage IIB: cervical stromal invasion iii a. Stage IIIA: tumor invades serosa or adnexa, or malignant peritoneal cytology iii b. Stage IIIB: vaginal metastasis iii c. Stage IIIC: metastasis to pelvic or para-aoic lymph nodes iv a. Stage IVA: invasion of the bladder or bowel iv b. Stage IVB: distant metastasis, including intraabdominal or inguinal lymph nodes Treatment Abdominal hysterectomy is recommended over vaginal hysterectomy because it affords the oppounity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any fuher evidence of cancer.",

They also provide protection against sexually transmitted diseases but can be irritating to vaginal tissue and may require additional lubrication. Barrier methods are an excellent choice in motivated couples\" Lactational amenorrhea For mothers who are nursing exclusively, ovulation occurring during the first 10 weeks after delivery is unlikely. But it is not a reliable method if mother is nursing only in day time. Waiting for first menses involves a risk of pregnancy because ovulation usually antedates menstruation.

Symptoms may include deepening of voice, frontal balding, severe acne or hirsutism or both, increased muscle mass and clitoromegaly. Accordingly, serum testosterone levels may be used to exclude these tumors. Free testosterone levels are more sensitive than total testosterone levels as an indicator of hyperandrogenism. Although improving, current free testosterone assays lack a uniform laboratory standard. For this reason. total testostrerone levels remain the best approach for excluding a tumor. Threshold values beyond 200 ng / dl of total testosterone warrant evaluation for an ovarian leison. \" So now I do not need to explain that testosterone estimation is the best investigation in case of rapid onset hirsutism and amennorhea.

Ovarian malignancies generally present with vague symptoms like abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and patient may also experience irregular menses and if pelvic mass compresses the bladder or rectum she may have urinary frequency or constipation. In advanced stages patients have symptoms related to presence of ascites, omental metastasis or bowel metastasis like abdominal distension, dyspnea, bloating, nausea, anorexia or early satiety. In the patient given in the question all these symptoms are present (which could be seen in other cancers as well) plus her Ca 125 levels are raised, which favors the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in her. Remember The most important sign of epithelial ovarian cancer is the presence of a pelvic mass on physical examination.

Some studies have proved that progesterone can be used as tocolytics. Progesterone does have a role in prefer'', labour According to American college of obs and Gynae (ACOG) progesterone is given in patients with history of previous preterm labour and in women who are at risk for preterm labour (i. e., women with sho cervix). - In these patients progesterone administration stas from 16th month and is continued up to 36 months progesterone acts by reducing uterine contractions. An impoant point Progesterone reduces or prevents uterine contractions when the uterine contractions are not fully established but once the labour sets in i. e., regular uterine contractions sta progesterone has no role. - Progesterone cannot prevent regular uterine contractions of labour. We are not sure from the question, what they want to ask. The question does not clearly differentiate if they are asking about uterine contractions of pregnancy or labour. Once again remember If labour has begun, progesterone has no use. Among other tocolytics, calcium channel blockers have the least side effects. It is an effective tocolytic that is well tolerated by the majority of the pregnant patient. No significant fetal problems have been repoed after treatment with Nifedipine. The most common side effect seen with Nifedipine is lowering of B. P, facial flushing can be seen in ceain cases. Unlike the [3 adrenergic tocolytics they have no effect on carbohydrate metabolism and can be given to diabetic patient.

They also have serious side effects which are Pulmonary edema - It is a serious and common side effect of 13 agonists. - It occurs in patients receiving oral or intravenous treatment. - It is common in patients having chorioamnionitis and in twins. Hyperglycemia - When 13 adrenergic drugs are given to patients with insulin dependent diabetes it causes significant hyperglycemia, glycosuria and ketonuria. - This occurs due to increased glycogenolysis and increased lipolysis. fi adrenergic agents are contraindicated in chorioamnionitis Side effects of magnesium Pulmonary edema Hypothermia Neuromuscular toxicity",

Friends, Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is an impoant and emerging topic for PGME exams. It is one of the least touched topic at undergraduate level. Therefore, I am explaining it in detail. Do go through it: Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: It is a treatable, autoimune disorder associated with recurrent second trimester pregnancy loss. deg Antiphospholipid antibodies are acquired antibodies targeted against a phospholipid. They can be IgM, IgG or IgA isotopes. Most impoant antiphospholipid antibodies are: Lupus anticoagulant (LAC) -- It was named so because it was first found in patients with SLE & prolonged paial thromboplastin time -- But the name is a misomer as though it increases PTT (i. e., similar to anticoagulant) but functions as a procoagulant & causes thrombosis Anticardiolipin antibody - It is most commonly seen in patients with repetitive early pregnancy loss BFP - ST i. e. antibody which causes biologically false positive syphilis test -- Less common antiphospholipid antibody - Both anticardio lipin & BFPST antibodies measure the antibody against cardiotipin but they are not same. Diagnosis For diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome there should be two positive tests 6 weeks apa for lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibody. Mqrpclerrient 7 Treatment as proposed by ACOG is a combination of low dose aspirin (81 mg) daily and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in prophylactic doses (e. g. dalteparin 5000 units S/C twice daily), staed as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Aspirin can be initiated preconceptionaly and is usually discontinued at 36 weeks. LMWH is continued up to term and for 5 days postpaum. Women with previous history of thrombosis will usually already be on maintenance therapy with warfarin. In such cases as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, warfarin is changed to LMWH and aspirin. Although this treatment improves overall pregnancy success, these women remain at high risk for preterm labor, PROM. IUGR. preeclampsia and placental abruption. In question 10 Patient is presenting with recurrent aboions with isolated increase in APTT which leaves no doubt that lupus anticoagulant is the cause.",

Clinical features Obstetric cholestasis most commonly presents in the third trimester (80% develop symptoms after 1st week). The pruritus is often severe and typically the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet are involved but the legs, thighs arms, backs, breasts and abdomen are also repoed. The diseaes tends to recur in every pregnancy and so a pa history of the condition is impoant. The disease is more common among multiple gestations. Other signs and symptoms of liver disease are not observed. Additional symptoms which may be repoed in common with other forms of cholestasis are right upper quadrant pain, pale stools and dark urine. Changes in liver function in obstetric cholestasis The most common abnormalities in liver function are - Increase in ALT (seen in 100% cases) - Increase in AST (seen in 99% cases) - Increase in bile acids (seen in 92% cases) - Elevated bilirubin (22% of cases) - Increased GGT (39% cases) Elevations in alkaline phosphatase are seen in cholestatic disease such as obstetric cholestasis as it is released from the damaged liver but because the enzyme is also released from the placenta in normal pregnancies, measurements are less helpful than outside the pregnancy. Serum bile acid test is the most accurate determinant of cholestasis of pregnancy. The problem with the bile acid test is that only a small number of labs around the world have the equipment necessary to perform it which can result in a considerable delay for women experiencing symptoms of the conditions. Liver biopsy in a case of obstetric cholestasis:? Liver biopsy demonstrates:? - Acinar cholestasis with centrilobular bile staining and bile plugs in the canaliculi. Liver biopsy is the definitive diagnostic test of the disease. Postnatal course in obstetric cholestasis - Biochemical abnormalities and pruritius in obsetric cholestasis persists until delivery following which resolution occurs. - Pruritus is typically absent within 48 hour after delivery usually improved within 1 week. - Liver function tests becomes normal within 6 weeks. Complications of obstetric cholestasis - Meconium stained liquor - Premature delivery - Fetal distress - Post paum hemorrhage Treatment of obstetric cholestasis: - i) Antihistamines - Chlorpheniramine can provide symptomatic relief in pruritus. ii) Topical treatments - If the skin is well moistured pruritus may be relieved. iii) Ursodeoxycholic acid iv) S-Adenosyl methiomine v) Dexamethasone - Dexamethasone in high dose results in resolution of all pruritus cases and significant reduction in total bile acids and ALT. vi) Vitamin K - In obstetric cholestasis there is malabsorption and subsequent deficiency of vitamin K. This will increase the risk of postpaum hemorrhage. - Vitamin K injection is given to reduce the risk of PPH.",

Pelvic examination demonstrates that the uterine cervix lies low within the vaginal canal, but does not protrude through the introitus. For minor degrees of this patient's disorder, Kegel exercises are sometimes prescribed. These can be performed by asking the patient to do which of the following?",
        "exp": "The Kegel exercises are specifically designed to contract the pubococcygeus muscle, and can be performed by interrupting the flow of urine. Patients with minor degrees of prolapse may also be treated with a pessary, which is a small object placed in the vagina that serves as a mechanical suppo for the uterus. Estrogen therapy is also of some help in some patients. Severe degrees of prolapse may require either hysterectomy or surgical strengthening of the pelvic floor. First choice describes the Valsalva maneuver, which these patients should not do, because it increases intra-abdominal pressure and may worsen the prolapse. (They should also avoid lifting heavy objects for the same reason).",
