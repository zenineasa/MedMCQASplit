Resistant, or refractory, cases are those that have a rising or plateaued h. CG while on EMA/CO So by definition Plateau of h. CG is seen in resistent and not relapsed cases hence I am chosing it as the option of choice Also know: Management of Recurrent Gestational Trohoblastic neoplasia Diagnosis Careful radiological assessment should be done in such patients to identify the sites of potentially resectable disease FDG -- PET may be used to locate sites of disease in cases showing serological relapse without visible abnormality on conventional imaging. Treatment Treatment is usually surgical resection followed by postoperative chemotherapy. If no site of relapse is identified. hysterectomy should be done as the most likely site of relapse is uterus. The most effective second line chemotherapy is EMA/EP i. e. Etoposide, actinomycins & methotrexate alternating weekly with etoposide and cisplatin This regimen is toxic but has a repoed remission rate of >80% An emerging less toxic alternative is fonightly regimen of paclitaxel + cisplatin alternating with paclitaxel + Etoposide.",

FICG levels are < 1000 IUL Now - The question arises whether we should give single dose MTx or multidose methotrexate treatment. In the trials which have been conducted - No difference was found in treatment duration, ph. CG levels and side effects in single dose vs multidose methotrexate therapy. Single dose therapy is more commonly used becasue of simplicity. It is less expensive, requires less invasive post therapy monitoring and does not require leucovorin supplementation. One trial has shown that multidose therapy has greater chance of success than single dose but this is not suppoed by any other trial so, single dose methotrexate is being used commonly.

Procedure: After appropriate inspection of the landmarks and endometrial cavity, a wire loop electrode is used to resect several strips of endomyometrium, to a depth of 4mm.

After a few strips are resected initially from the posterior uterine wall, resection of almost all the remaining surface with loop electrode by vaporization is performed. The procedure should be performed soon after menstruation or the woman should be given progesterone, danazol or Gn. RH to suppress the endometrium.

Intermittent vaginal bleeding that follows coitus i. e. post coital bleeding is a very specific symptom of cervical cancer. Now in patients suspected of having cervical cancer, management is: \"In those with suspected cervical cancer, a thorough external genital and vaginal examination should be should be performed, looking for concomitant lesions\"... Williams Gynae 1st /ed p 653 So the first step should be thorough clinical and vaginal examination. Papanicolaou Smear - \"Histologic evaluation of cervical biopsy is the primary tool used to diagnose cervical cancer. Although pap smears are performed extensively to screen for this cancer, this test does not always detect cervical cancer. Specifically, Pap smear testing has only a 55- 80% sensitivity for detecting high grade, lesions on any given single test. Thus, the preventive power of Pap smear testing lies in a regular serial screening. Moreover, in women who have stage-I cervical cancer, only 30 to 50% of single cytologic smears obtained are read as positive for cancer hence, the use of pap smear alone for evaluation of suspicious lesion is discouraged. Importantly, these lesions should be directly biopsied. \"... Williams Gynae 1st /ed p 653 This means whenever a patient comes with specific complaint like post coital bleeding pap smear is not the initial test colposcopy should directly be done. This rules out pap smear. Now read what Novaks has to say on this issue - \"When obvious tumor growth is present, a cervical biopsy is usually sufficient for diagnosis. If gross disease is not present, a colposcopic examination with cervical biopsies and endocervical curettage is warranted. If the diagnosis cannot be established conclusively with colposcopy and directed biopsies, cervical conization may be necessary. \"...

C: Alkanline Phosphatase The triple test/ triple screen/Kettering test/ Ba's test is an investigation performed during pregnancy in the second trimester to classify a patient as either high-risk or low-risk for chromosomal abnormalities (and neural tube defects). The term \"multiple-marker screening test\" is sometimes used instead. This term can encompass the \"double test\" and \"quadruple test\". A positive test means having a high risk of chromosomal abnormalities (and neural tube defects), and such patients are then referred for more sensitive and specific procedures to receive a definitive diagnosis, mostly invasive procedures like amniocentesis. The Triple test measures serum levels: Alpha-fetoprotein is made in the yolk sac and in the fetal liver, and some amount of AFP gets into the mother's blood. In neural tube defects, the skin of the fetus is not intact and so larger amount of AFP is measured in the mother's blood. In Down syndrome, the AFP is decreased in the mother's blood, presumably because the yolk sac and fetus are smaller than usual. Estriol is a hormone produced by the placenta, using ingredients made by the fetal liver and adrenal gland. Estriol is decreased in the Down syndrome pregnancy. Human chorionic gonadotropin hormone is produced by the placenta, and is used to test for the presence of pregnancy. A specific smaller pa of the hormone, called the beta subunit, is increased in Down syndrome pregnancies.",

First, the local effect of progestin on cervical mucus make it thick and relatively impenetrable to bacteria. Since uterine bleeding is eventually greatly decreased in users of the LNG-IUD (progestin releasing IUD), any retrograde menstruation (which might seed the fallopian tubes with bacteria) should be reduced as well. In addition, decidual changes in the endometrium may make it less susceptible to infection. In other words, progestin-releasing IUDs may mimic the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate against upper-genital-tract infection. Also know: PID is common in non hormonal IUCD. IUCD related bacterial infections are due to contamination of endometrial cavity at the time of inseion. Actinomycosis infection is related to IUCD use. Most common side effect of 1. UCD's is increased vaginal bleeding. 2nd most common side effect of IUCD: Pain in Lower back or cramps in lower abdomen.",

The duct passes downward by the side of the uterus to the level of internal os. It then runs forward to reach the anteriolateral aspect of the vaginal wall and may reach down as far as the hymen. The cyst can be diagnosed by its position as it is found on the lateral or anterolateral wall (here 10 0' clock position) of the vagina. lnfact majority of the vaginal cysts arise from Ganer's duct. They can be distinguished from Baholin's cyst, urethrocele, cystocele and urethral diveiculum by their position, by the fact they do not disappear with pressure or with change of posture and by demonstrating with around or other means that they do not communicate with the bladder or urethra. On the other hand Baholin's cyst arises from Baholin's gland which lies near the junction of middle and posterior third of labia majora therefore the cyst is also found there (not on the junction of lower 1/3 and upper 2/ 3 anterior wall of vagina).

Serum FSH levels vary significantly across the cycle hence FSH is best measured during the early follicular phase ( cycle day 2-4). Basal serum estradiol concentration has little value as ovarian reserve test. AMH: Antimullerian hormone is produced from preantral and small antral follicles hence AMH levels are gonadotropin-independent and exhibit little variation within and between menstrual cycles. AMH threshold levels (0. 2-0. 7ng/ml) has 40-97% sensitivity, 70-92% specificity, 22-88% PPV and 97-100% NPV for predicting poor response to stimulation (<3 follicles or < 2-4oocytes).",

After ovulation, under the influence of progesterone, the mucus thickens and lessens in quantity. It is recommended that women use a tissue paper to wipe inside the vagina to assess quantity and character of mucus. Intercourse is considered safe during the dry days immediately after the menses initial the mucus is detected. Thereafter the couple must abstain until the fouh day after the peak day. To practice this method, the women should be able to distinguish between different types of mucus. This requires a high degree of motivation.

Also, there may be inadequate voluntary maternal muscle effort during second-stage labor. - Abnormalities of presentation, position, or development of the fetus. - Abnormalities of the maternal bony pelvis-that is, pelvic contraction. - Abnormalities of soft tissues of the reproductive tract that form an obstacle to fetal descent. Common clinical findings in women with ineffective labor Inadequate cervical dilation or fetal descent: Protracted labor-slow progress Arrested labor-no progress Inadequate expulsive effort-ineffective pushing. Fetopelvic disproportion: Excessive fetal size Inadequate pelvic capacity Malpresentation or position of the fetus Ruptured membranes without labor. Dystocia is the most common current indication for primary cesarean delivery. American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology recommend (1995a) that the cervix be dilated to 4 cm or more before dystocia is diagnosed, thus, the diagnosis often is made before active labor, and therefore before an adequate trial of labor which leads to unnecessary cesarean section.",

Early labor ECV - provided there is good amount of liquor amnii and there is no contraindication. ECV should be tried in all cases. LSCS - is the preferred method of delivery if version fails or is contraindicated. ate labor Baby alive - If the baby is mature and fetal condition is good, it is preferable to do LSCS in all cases. Baby dead - LSCS even in such cases, is much safer in the hands of those who are not conversant with destructive operation. If the obstetrician is conversant with destructive operation, decapitation or evisceration is to be done. Following destructive operation, the uterine cavity is to be explored to exclude rupture of uterus. Internal version should not be done. According to Onset of active labor in a woman with a transverse lie is an indication for cesarean delivery. Once labor is well established, attempts at conversion to a longitudnal lie by abdominal manipulation are likely to be unsuccessful. Before labor or early in labor, with the membranes intact, attempts at external version are woh trying in absence of other complications that indicate cesarean section. In the given question 38 weeks primi is presenting in Early labour so external cephalic version could have been tried. but it is not given in the option, so our answer is LSCS. Note: While doing LSCS--a transverse incision into the uterus may lead to difficult fetal extraction. Therefore a veical incision is typically indicated.",

Causes: Itch due to infections Candida albicans infection (vulvovaginal thrush) is the most impoant microorganism to consider in a postpubeal woman with vulval itch. Bacterial vaginosis causes a frothy, malodorous discharge, and uncommonly causes vulval itch, possibly as a result of contact dermatitis. Genital viral was are often itchy. Pinworms can reside in the vagina or anus and cause itch when they exit at night. Infections that rarely cause vulval itch include cytolytic vaginosis (associated with vaginal lactobacilli) and trichomoniasis. Itch due to an inflammatory skin condition Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common cause of an itchy vulva at all ages. It may be due to diverse causes, including: Age-related prepubeal or postmenopausal lack of oestrogen Underlying tendency to atopic dermatitis Scratching for another reason Friction from skin folds, clothing, activity, or sexual intercourse Moisture due to occlusive underwear Urine and/or faeces Soap or harsh cleanser Frequent washing Inappropriate or unnecessary chemical applications, including over-the-counter or prescribed medications Fissuring of the posterior fourchette Normal, excessive or infected vaginal secretions Severe vulval itch may be due to: Lichen simplex Lichen sclerosus Lichen planus Other common skin disorders that may cause vulval itch include: Psoriasis Seborrhoeic dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis* Irritant or allergic contact uicaria Dermographism Folliculitis *Potential vulval allergens include: Methylisothiazolinone, a preservative in moist wipes Various textile dyes in underwear Fragrance in a douche or antiperspirant Rubber accelerants in condom, menstrual cup or underwear Latex rubber and semen are potential causes of contact uicaria. Itch due to neoplasia Benign and malignant neoplastic disorders of the vulva are often asymptomatic in their early stages, but they can cause itch. The most common cancerous lesions are: Squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL, also known as vulval intraepithelial neoplasia or VIN) Extramammary Paget disease Invasive vulval cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) Itch due to neuropathy",

The pain is primarily in the lower abdomen but may increasingly be referred to the lumbosacral area, gluteal region, and thighs as labor progresses.

        "question": "Ideal contraceptive for lactating mothers is:",
        "exp": "lactational amenorrhoea An almost similar question was asked previously in 'All India' examination. Note that previously 'Most effective' contraceptive was asked. Now the question is different -Ideal' contraceptive is asked. Practically, there are no ideal contraceptives (neither for lactating women, nor for non-lactating women). An Ideal contraceptive is one which is - 100% effective, 100% safe, reversible with no side effects, and minimal effect on lactation. The Barrier methods and Combined OCPs can be easily ruled out; as barrier methods have high failure rates if used alone; while combined OCPs have a negative effect on breast milk production. Lactational amenorrhoea is the most ideal contraceptive for a lactating women, as it has viually no side effects, rather it has plethora of benefits for both mother and child. About effectiveness, it is almost equally effective to Progesterone only pills (POPs) when used perfectly. (see the below given table). Failure rates: Contraceptive method Typical use Perfect use LAM (6 months only) 2. 0 0. 5 IUD 0. 8 0. 6 POP 'mini pill' 8. 0 0. 5 Combined oral contraceptive 6-8 0. 1 Barrier method 14 3. 0 Lactational amenorrhoea (LAM) is a natural, safe and effective contraceptive method which can be used upto 6 months post paum if the following conditions are met. (Note that LAM is not pure simple exclusive breast feeding; following conditions need to be fulfilled) The mother should not experience vaginal bleeding after the 8 weeks postpaum. The baby is less than 6 months old. The baby is exclusively breastfed. Breast. feeding is done at least every 4 hrs. during the day and every 6 hrs during night. If the above conditions are fulfilled then LAM can give more than 98% protection from pregnancy. It has the added benefit of promoting exclusive breast feeding which is the ideal nutrition for infants. Lactational Amenorrhoea Advantages Disadvantages * Very effective if used perfectly * Can be used only for a sho * Has no side effects period (6 months post paum) * Promotes exclusive breast feeding, and therefore enhances maternal and infant health. * Does not require inseion of any device at the time of sexual intercourse * Can be initiated immediately postpaum * Is economical and requires no commodities or supplies * Reduces mother's lifetime risk of breast cancer. Physiology of LAM: Infant's suckling is the stimulus that initiates the state of lactational amenorrhea for breastfeeding women. The act of suckling elevates prolactin levels, and reduces Gn. RH from the hypothalamus. This reduces LH release thus inhibiting follicular maturation. This prevents ovulation. But, even with continued nursing, ovulation eventually returns after 6 months, so another method of contraception should be used 6 months postpaum, or sooner if the menses resume. Ovalation has been seen to resume even earlier in some patients, so some books advice 'Rule of 3' i. e. - another contraceptive method should be use along with LAM beginning from the 3rd postpaum month. - and if the women is paially breastfeeding or not breastfeeding, the contraceptive should begin by the 3rd postpaum week. Progesterone only pills are the most effective contraceptive during lactation amongst the options provided. They have drawbacks like: - Have to be taken regularly at the same time - Cause spotting or irregular bleeding, ectopic pregnancy, headache, nausea, acne, hirsuitism and weight gain",

They appear as single, red, smooth elongated masses extending from the external os. Polyps vary in size and range from several millimetres to 2 or 3cm. These common growths are found more frequently in multiparas and rarely in prepubeal females. Endocervical polyps are typically asymptomatic, but they can cause metrorrhagia, postcoital bleeding and symptomatic vaginal discharge. They are usually identified by visual inspection during pelvic examination. In some instances, Pap smear findings of atypical glandular cells have been associated with endocervical polyps. Although they are typically benign, but malignant transformation may develop in 1 percent. Impoantly, cervical cancer can present as polypoid masses and can mimic these beinign lesions. For this reason removal and histologic evaluation are recommended for an endocervical polyp. Endocervical polyps are removed by grasping the polyp with a ring or polyp forceps. The polyp is twisted repeatedly about the base of its stalk to strangulate its feeding v essels. With repeated twisting the base will avulse. Monsel solution (ferric subsulfate) can be applied with direct pressure to the resulting stalk stub to complete hemostasis.",

The primitive germ cells take their origin from the yolk sac at about the end of 3rd week and their migration to the developing gonadal ridge is completed round about the end of 4th week. In the female gonads, the germ cells undergo a number of rapid mitotic divisions and differentiate into oogonia. The number of oogonia reaches its maximum at 20th week, numbering about 7 million. While the majority of the oogonia continue to divide, some enter into the prophase of the first meiotic division and are called primary oocytes. These are surrounded by flat cells and are called primordial follicles and are present in the coex of the ovary. At bih, there is no more mitotic division and all the oogonia are replaced by primary oocytes which have finished the prophase of the first meiotic division and remain in resting phase (dictyotene stage) between prophase and metaphase. Total number of primary oocytes at bih is estimated to be about 2 million. The primary oocytes do not finish the first meiotic division until pubey is reached. At pubey, some 400, 000 primary oocytes are left behind, the rest being atretic. Out of these, some 400 are likely to ovulate during the entire reproductive period.",

Werentiation into spermatoznq (or sperms) is called as spermatogenesis. Sholy before pubey. the primordial germ cells develop into sperrnatogonia in the wall of seminiferous tubules. Meiosis is a special type of cell division that reduces the diploid number of chromosomes (i. e., 46) to the haploid number of 23. It takes place only in germ cells; to give rise to gametes (sperms and egg cells) It involves two meiotic cell divisions, meiosis I and meiosis II. The first metotic division is a reduction division because the chromosome number is reduced from diploid (46) to haploid (23). The 2nd meiotic division is similar to mitosis as daughter cells formed contain the same haploid number of chromosomes as the mother cell. Thus. though nation 'a' and both are correct but reduction division occurs when primary spermatocyte is transformed to secondary spermatocyte, so it is the answer of choice. Extra Edae: The developmental process from spermatogonium to sperm takes about 61 daysdeg and the entire process, including the transit time in the ductal system takes approximately three months. deg Clinical significance The above fact is clinically significant, as in case of male factor infeility a repeat semen analysis to see the sperm count, motility etc. after giving treatment should be;,, ne three months the first analysis (as new sperms will be formed after 3 months).",

This \"sex chromatin\" (or Barr body or X-chromatin) is one of the two X chromosomes present in females. As a general rule, only 1 X chromosome functions in a cell at a given time. All other X chromosomes present in a cell may be seen as X-chromatin bodies in a resting nucleus. Thus, if one knows the number of X chromosomes, one can anticipate that the number of Barr bodies will be 1 less. If one counts the number of Barr bodies, the number of X chromosomes can be determined by adding 1. Hence Barr bodies are not seen in genotype XO. The male cell has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, therefore no sex chromatin is visible in males. Ref: Manipalviratn S., Trivax B., Huang A. (2013). Chapter 3.

Therefore, oxygen carrying capacity of blood also increases (Viiiiiiam 23, e, p 115). Therefore, vtion \"d is correct. BEWARE - In pregnancy hemoglobin mass increases(to the extent of 18-20%) but hemoglobin concentration decreases due to hemodilution. Now let's have a look at Iron metabolism in pregnancy. - During pregnancy there is marked demand of extra iron especially in the second half. - Even an adequate diet cannot provide the extra demand of iron. Thus In pregnancy there is always a state of physiological iron deficiency.

Although the pathogenesis is still unclear, the first event appears to be placental ischemia, probably due to abnormalities in the trophoblast and alterations in the maturation of placental vessels. The trophoblast of invading placental vessels fails to acquire the characteristics of normal endothelial cells, with subsequent alterations in blood flow. Placental ischemia then triggers the release of thromboplastic substances, increases renin synthesis, and reduces prostaglandin E levels. Chorioamnionitis is an infection of chorioamniotic membranes due to bacteria that ascend through the vaginal canal. This is an impoant cause of spontaneous aboion in the second and third trimester, but it plays no role in the pathogenesis of toxemia of pregnancy. The release of thromboplastic substances may cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Mentoanterior face presentation, extended breech and dichorionic twins with first veex and second breech, all of these can be allowed for vagina delivery. Monochorionic monoamniotic twins are best delivered by caeserean section as soon as lung maturity is attained for fear of entanglement and tightening of umbilical cord which may lead to fetal distress and death. Monoamniotic twins are rare, complicating < 1% of monozygotic twins. They have a very high fetal moality rate of 40%. Besides cord entanglement these twins are at greater risk of congenital anomalies, conjoining, preterm bih and twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Let's have a revision of twinning: Mode of delivery of twin pregnancy After the first twin is delivered vaginally, some norms are to be followed for delivery of second twin as depicted in thefollowing flowcha- ECV - External cephalic version, CPD - Cephalopelvic dispropoion. NVD - Normal vaginal delivery, IPV - Internal podalic version Unskilled in IPV. breech extraction and assisted breech delivery.

        "question": "Ideal contraceptive for lactating mothers is a. EUR'",
        "exp": "Lactational amenorrhoea An almost similar question was asked previously in 'All India' examination. Note that previously 'Most effective' contraceptive was asked. Now the question is different -Ideal' contraceptive is asked. Practically, there are no ideal contraceptives (neither for lactating women, nor for non-lactating women). An Ideal contraceptive is one which is - 100% effective, 100% safe, reversible with no side effects, and minimal effect on lactation. The Barrier methods and Combined OCPs can be easily ruled out; as barrier methods have high failure rates if used alone, while combined OCPs have a negative effect on breast milk production. Lactational amenorrhoea is the most ideal contraceptive for a lactating women, as it has viually no side effects, rather it has plethora of benefits for both mother and child. About effectiveness, it is almost equally effective to Progesterone only pills (POPs) when used perfectly. (see the below table) Failure rates: Contraceptive method Typical use Perfect use LAM (6 months only) 2. 0 0. 5 IUD 0. 8 0. 6 POP 'mini pill' 8. 0 0. 5 Combined oral contraceptive 6-8 0. 1 Barrier method 14 3. 0 Lactational amenorrhoea (LAM) is a natural, safe and effective contraceptive method which can be used upto 6 months post paum if the following conditions are met. (Note that LAM is not pure simple exclusive breast feeding; following conditions need to be fulfilled) I. The mother should not experience vaginal bleeding after the 8 weeks postpaum. The baby is less than 6 months old. The baby is exclusively breastfed. Breast feeding is done at least every 4 hrs. during the day and every 6 hrs during night. If the above conditions are fulfilled then LAM can give more than 98% protection from pregnancy. It has the added benefit of promoting exclusive breast feeding which is the ideal nutrition for infants. Lactational Amenorrhoea Advantages Disadvantages * Very effective if used perfectly * Can be used only for a sho period * Has no side effects (6 months post paum) * Promotes exclusive breast feeding, and therefore enhances maternal and infant health. * Does not require inseion of any device at the time of sexual intercourse * Can be initiated immediately postpaum * Is economical and requires no commodities or supplies * Reduces mother's lifetime risk of breast cancer. Physiology of LAM: Infant's suckling is the stimulus that initiates the state of lactational amenorrhea for breastfeeding women. The act of suckling elevates prolactin levels, and reduces Gn. RH from the hypothalamus. This reduces LH release thus inhibiting. follicular maturation. This prevents ovulation. But, even with continued nursing, ovulation eventually returns after 6 months, so another method of contraception should be used 6 months postpaum, or sooner if the menses resume. Ovalation has been seen to resume even earlier in some patients, so some books advice 'Rule of 3' i. e. - another contraceptive method should be use along with LAM beginning from the 3rd postpaum month. - and if the women is paially breastfeeding or not breastfeeding, the contraceptive should begin by the 3rd postpaum week. Progesterone only pills are the most effective contraceptive during lactation amongst the options provided. They have drawbacks like: - Have to be taken regularly at the same time - Cause spotting or irregular bleeding, ectopic pregnancy, headache, nausea, acne, hirsuitism and weight gain",

Right handedness is more common in population It is believed that right sided predominance was either genetically determined or due to differences in vasculature of the ovaries. The anatomical asymmetry between the left and right side are also thought to be the reason. Ovulation In the primate, it is suggested that ovulations occur with equal frequency in the left and right ovary. In the humans, there is some controversy about the frequency of ovulation on either side It is believed that in normally menstruating women, ovulation was significantly higher in right ovary. It is believed that right sided predominance was either genetically determined or due to differences in vasculature of the ovaries. The anatomical asymmetry between the left and right side are also thought to be the reason. The left ovarian vein drains to the left renal vein and the right ovarian vein to the IVC. The left renal vein is thought to be under pressure than the right and therefore drain slower. Because the left ovary drain slower, the collapsed follicle (corpus leuteum) takes longer to clean and thereby diminishes the chances that ovulation will occur on that side the following month.

Cerebral edema and laryngeal edema, hemolysis and hepatic infarction, and hepatic rupture and renal coical necrosis can all be complications of preeclampsia, but are not the most common causes of maternal moality. Convulsions and renal tubular necrosis can be complications of preeclampsia, but convulsions indicate that eclampsia has developed.
