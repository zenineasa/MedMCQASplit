By convention, assisted reproductive techniques are those at some point require extraction and isolation of an oocyte. In IVF: Mature oocytes from stimulated ovaries are retrieved transvaginally with sonographic guidance. Sperm and ova are then combined in vitro to prompt feilization, and if successful embryos are transferred transcervically into the endometrial cavity using sonographic guidance. In GIFT: Eggs and sperm are placed catheter through the fimbria and deposited directly into the oviduct. In ZIFT: Zygote is transferred into the fallopian tube at laparoscopy. ZIFT currently is considered most appropriate in rare case in which transcervical transfer during IVF is technically not feasible. Ref: Williams Gynecology, 2e, chapter 20",

Normally, this measures 10 cm or more, but it cannot be measured directly with examining fingers. Thus, for clinical purposes, the obstetrical conjugate is estimated indirectly by subtracting 1. 5 to 2 cm from the diagonal conjugate, which is determined by measuring the distance from the lowest margin of the symphysis to the sacral promontory 7. The transverse diameter is constructed at right angles to the obstetrical conjugate and represents the greatest distance between the linea terminalis on either side. It usually intersects the obstetrical conjugate at a point approximately 5 cm in front of the promontory and measures approximately 13 cm 8.

Causes of female pseudohermaphroditism are: \u2022 Congenital adrenal hyperplasia. (M/C cause) \u2022 Increased androgens in the mother which cross the placenta and cause virilization of the external genitalia. Like maternal intake of androgenic drugs, maternal adrenal tumor, etc. \u2022 Placental aromatase deficiency. Aromatase enzyme is responsible for conversion of testosterone to estradiol. If this enzyme is deficient there will be excess of testosterone. \u2022 Wnt4 mutation. Wnt4 Mullerian aplasia is a disorder that occurs in females and affects their reproductive system. There is abnormal development of the Mullerian duct, and ovarian dysfunction so females have an underdeveloped or absent uterus and may also have abnormalities of other reproductive organs. Women with this condition have primary amenorrhea, normal breast and pubic hair development and higher than normal levels of androgens in their blood. These high levels of androgens cause acne, hirsutism and virilisation. Kidney abnormalities may also be present in some affected individuals.",

In the other, hypertonic uterine dysfuctio or incoordinate uterine dysfunction, either the basal tone is elevated appreciably or the pressure gradient is distorted. Gradient distortion may result from contraction of the mid-segment of the uterus with more force than the fundus or from complete asynchronism of the impulses originating in each cornu, or from a combination of these two. Pain is present before, during and after contractions. This results in fetal hypoxia in labor. Placental abruption is often associated with high baseline tone (> 25 mm Hg). On CTG the FHR shows reduced variability and late decelerations. Effect on the fetus: Fetal distress appears early due to placental insufficiency caused by inadequate relaxation of the uterus. Management: There is no place of oxytocin augmentation with this abnormality. Cesarean section is done in majority of cases. Adequate pain relief or sedation is helpful.",

(i. e specific) Structurally it is similar to - FSH, LH, TSH but functionally it is similar to LH ( i. e luteotropic), i. e. helps in maintaining corpus luteum. So, the main hormone which maintains activity of corpus luteum during pregnancy is h. CG and in non pregnant state is LH. The half life of h. CG is 36 hours. In early pregnancy the doubling time of h. CG is 1. 4-2 days. It can be detected in maternal serum as early as 8 days following fertilisation/day 22 of menstrual cycle/5 days before missed period by immuno assay. The level is 100 IU/L or m. IU/mL around the time of the expected menses. The levels progressively rise and reach maximum levels by about 8-10 weeks/70 days/1st trimester. It then falls until about 16 weeks and remains at low level up to term. h. CG disappears from circulation by 2 weeks following delivery. Action: Sustains the corpus luteum and thereby maintains the hormonal support to the pregnancy in early weeks. Stimulates the Leydig cells of the male fetus to produce testosterone and thereby induces development of the male external genitalia. Immunosuppressive action which helps in the maintenance of pregnancy.

It takes place in the middle segment (ampulla) of fallopian tube. Before feilization, the ovum and sperms reach the ampulla for feilization. Fusion of spermatocyte and ovum leads to formation of zygote. First week of development begins immediately after feilization and includes:? i) Cleavage of zygote: Zygote (feilized ovum) stas dividing immediately and large zygote is subdivided into smaller daughter cells called blastomeres. Blastomeres are still surrounded by zona pellucida. Cleavage occurs in fallopian tube (uterine tube). ii) Formation of morula: At about 16 cells stage the blastomeres tightly align by the process of compaction to form a compact ball of cells called morula (mulberry). This process of compaction leads to segregation of cells into two groups (i) inner cells (inner cell mass), and (ii) outer cells (outer cell mass). Morula enters uterine cavity 4 days after feilization. iii) Formation of blastocyst: As the morula enters the uterine cavity, uterine fluid diffuses through zona pellucida and fills small intercellular gaps between blastomeres, and morula is conveed to blastocyst. Blastocyst consists of:? a) Zona pellucida: Outer covering. b) Embryoblast: A group of centerally located cells of inner cell mass and later give rise to tissues of embryo proper. c) Trophoblast: A thin outer layer of cells formed from outer cells mass and later give rise extraembryonic tissues. d) Blastocele: Cavity of blastocyst: The region of blastocyst containing embryoblast is known as embryonic pole and the opposite pole, the abembryonic pole. The trophoblasts overlying the embryoblast at embryonic pole is called polar trophoblast and that occupying the rest of wall called mural trophoblast.

Technique of preparing pap smear: A speculum is introduced in the vagina without lubricant and material from cervix is collected using Ayer's spatula. Whole of the squamocolumnar junction has to be scrapped i. e. rotate the spatula through 360deg and spread it on a slide (1s1 slide) and material is also collected from posterior wall of vagina (2\" slide) which acts as a control. The glass slide is not air rie as it gets damaged. The slide is fixed using ethyl alcohol. The main problem with conventional pap smears are that they are of variable thickness and may get obscured by mucus, blood and other debris. This results in cell and nuclear overlap, causing problems with detection and interpretation. To overcome this problem - Liquid based cytology has been developed. Liquid based cytology: Advantages? They decrease the number of false negative results. They decrease the number of inadequate smear collection. Can also be used for HPV typing and testing. Method: From Gynaecology for PG and Practitioners 2/e, p 620 - A plastic sampling device is used to collect the cells in the usual manner but instead of smearing it on a glass slide, the device is rinsed in a buffered methanol solution for transfer to the laboratory. It is subsequently tittered' to separate mucus and debris.",

The enzymes 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 21-hydroxylase, 11b-hydroxylase, and 18-hydroxylase modify pregnenolone to produce other sex and adrenal steroids. Deficiencies in adrenal 21-hydoxylase can thus lead to inadequate testosterone production in males and produce ambiguous external genitalia. Such children can also exhibit low sodium and high potassium due to deficiency of the more distal steroids, coisol and aldosterone. 5a-reductase conves testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, and its deficiency produces milder degrees of hypogenitalism without salt wasting. Deficiency of the androgen receptor is called testicular feminization, producing normal-looking females who may not seek medical attention until they present with infeility.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Uterus Bicornis Uterine malformation is the result of an abnormal development of the Mullerian duct. Class I: Mullerian agenesis (absent uterus). - Uterus is not present, vagina only rudimentary or absent. - The condition is also called Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. - The patient with MRKH syndrome will have primary amenorrhoea. Class II: unicornuate uterus (a one-sided uterus). - Only one side of the Mullerian duct forms. - The uterus has a typical \"penis shape\" on imaging systems. Class III: Uterus didelphys (double uterus). - Both Mullerian ducts develop but fail to fuse, thus the patient has a \"double uterus\". - This may be a condition with a double cervix and a vaginal paition (v. i.), or the lower Mullerian system fused into its unpaired condition. Class IV: Bicornuate uterus (uterus with two horns). - Only the upper pa of that pa of the Mullerian system that forms the uterus fails to fuse, thus the caudal pa of the uterus is normal, the cranial pa is bifurcated. - The uterus is \"hea-shaped\". Uterus bicornis unicolis is the most common. Class V: septated uterus (uterine septum or paition). The two Mullerian ducts have fused, but the paition between them is still present, splitting the system into two pas. - With a complete septum the vagina, cervix and the uterus can be paitioned. Usually the septum affects only the cranial pa of the uterus. - MRI is considered the preferred modality due to its multiplanar capabilities as well as its ability to evaluate the uterine contour, junctional zone, and other pelvic anatomy. - A hysterosalpingogram is not considered as useful due to the inability of the technique to evaluate the exterior contour of the uterus and distinguish between a bicornuate and septate uterus. - Class VI: DES uterus. The uterine cavity has a \"T-shape\" as a result of fetal exposure to Diethylstilbestrol. Arcuate uterus where there is a concave dimple in the uterine fundus within the cavity. A rudimentary uterus is a uterine remnant not connected to cervix and vagina and may be found on the other side of an unicornuate uterus.

        "exp": "Most women with an adult granulosa cell tumor are diagnosed after age 30, with the average age being approximately 50 years. Menometrorrhagia and postmenopausal bleeding are common signs and reflect a prolonged exposure of the endometrium to estrogen. Grossly, adult granulosa cell tumors are large, multicystic, and often exceed 10 to 15 cm in diameter. Microscopic examination shows predominantly granulosa cells with pale, grooved, \"coffee bean\" nuclei. The characteristic microscopic feature is the Call-Exner body--a rosette arrangement of cells around an eosinophilic fluid space. Endodermal sinus tumors, or yolk sac tumors, are the third most common germ cell tumor. This is the most rapidly growing neoplasm that occurs at any site, and patients may present with an acute abdomen given they are friable, necrotic, and often hemorrhagic. These tumors are almost always bilateral and, on histologic section, resemble the primitive gut and liver; Schiller-Duval bodies, which show a single papilla lined by tumor cells with a central blood vessel, and the production of AFP are characteristic. Teratomas possess somatic cells from at least two germ cell layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm). Variable degrees of differentiation allow for the subclassification of mature and immature forms. Mature teratoma consists of terminally differentiated tissues and can form cystic structures. Only about 2 to 3% of all Germ cell tumors show mature teratoma as the only histologic component, but teratoma is commonly present as an element of a mixed GCT. Ovarian fibroma can occur at any age but most often occur in the years before menopause. They range in size from incidental findings to greater than 20 cm. They are multinodular and whorled, and they are formed from bundles of collagen-producing spindle cells. Ref: Hoffman B. L., Schorge J. O., Schaffer J. I., Halvorson L. M., Bradshaw K.

Despite the presence of gonadotropin the ovary during lactational hyperprolactinemia does not display follicular development and does not secrete estrogen. These observations suggest that high concentrations of prolactin can work at both central level (by inhibiting pulsatile secretion of Gn. RH) and peripheral level i. e. ovarian sites (by inhibiting synthesis of progesterone and by changing testosterone/dihydrotestosterone ratio i. e. increasing local anti estrogen concentrations) to produce lactational amenorrhea and anovulation. The principle of Gn. RH suppression by prolactin is reinforced by the demonstration that, treatment of amenorrheic, lactating women with pulsatile Gn.

The six capsules are implanted in the inside pa of the upper arm. The levonorgestrel is released from the capsules gradually, providing contraception for about 5 years. The primary mechanism of action of Norplant is suppression of ovulation. IUCDs primarily work by preventing feilization. The progestogen released from the hormonal IUDs may prevent ovulation from occurring but only paially. The hormone also thickens the cervical mucus so that sperm cannot reach the fallopian tubes. Copper IUDs contain no hormones, but the copper ions in the cervical mucus are toxic to sperm. They also cause the uterus and fallopian tubes to produce a fluid that contains white blood cells, copper ions, enzymes, and prostaglandins, a combination that is also toxic to sperm. Mechanism of Action of Mini pill(Progesterone Containing pill): Progestin-only oral contraceptives - Mechanisms of action include (1) suppression of ovulation; (2) a variable dampening effect on the midcycle peaks of LH and FSH; (3) an increase in cervical mucus viscosity; (4) a reduction in the number and size of endometrial glands; and (5) a reduction in cilia motility in the fallopian tube",

TESA Friends, we have studied in detail IVF and IUI but either of them cannot be performed if appropriate methods for sperm recovery are not available in cases of male infeility. Sperm retrieval or Recovery can be done by: Microsurgical Epididymal Sperm aspiraton: MESAdeg Percutaneous Epididymal Sperm aspiration: PESAdeg Testicular sperm extraction: TESEdeg Percutaneous Testicular sperm fine needle aspiration: TESAdeg (also called as Fine Needle Aspiration FNA). The choice of the method depends on: the underlying diagnosis, whether goal of the procedure is diagnostic or therapeutic whether, isolated sperm will be used immediately or cryopreserved. TESA Is a percutaneous method which requires No/Local anesthesia and retrieves sperms from the testis when spermatogenesis is normal as in cases of post-testicular azoospermia (i. e. either there is congenital absence or obstruction of ', as deferens/ejaculatory ducts or Retrograde ejaculation). MESA Also indicated in cases of post testicular azoospermia. It is done when one need's to know the nature of obstruction or if surgical correction of the obstruction is to be performed at the same time of sperm recovery. (Done under GA/Regional anesthesia). Another advantage of MESA is that a very large number of sperms are usually retrieved so that cryopreservation and avoidance of repeat surgery may be possible PESA Percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration can also be used in cases of Post testicular azoosperma but it is a blind procedure. Bleeding. epididymal injury and postsurgical fibrosis can occur. TESE Indicated in men with testicular azoospermia or Gonadal failure. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection: i. e. ICSI Here a single sperm is injected into the cytoplasm of the oocyte which is then incubated over night. The procedure involves stripping of the aspirated cumulus complex of all surrounding Granulosa cells, so that micromanipulation can be performed on the egg itself. A holding pipette is used to stabilize the egg while an injection pipette is used to inse a ble sperm into the cytoplasm of the egg. Advantage: This procedure bypasses events like capacitation and acrosome reaction by the sperms. Indication: It is indicated in male factor infeiliy: When sperm is count is less than 5 million / ml (severe oligospermia). Absolute indications: asthenospermia i. e. < 5% progressive motility. Teratospermia i. e. < 4% normal sperms. No. of motile sperms is < 0. 5. X106/m1 (as in these conditions IUI cannot be done). If sperms lack acrosome. Abnormal sperm morphology.

Polymenorrhea occurs in ovulatory bleeding where the ovary goes through its normal cycle but does it more quickly. The acceleration mainly affects the follicular phase of menstrual cycle.

Treatment with estrogen-progestin contraceptives induces regular, predictable menses and attenuates endometrial growth, thereby eliminating the risk for developing endometrial hyperplasia and neoplasia Current oral contraceptives contain ethinyl estradiol, in doses ranging from 20 mcg to 50 mcg daily, and one of a variety of progestins All low-dose oral contraceptives (containing 20-35 micro g ethinyl estradiol) have similar effectiveness in the treatment of acne and hirsutism Cyproterone is a derivative of 17a-hydroxyprogesterone (17.

The prenatal course was significant for a positive group B Streptococcus culture performed at 35 weeks. Antenatal testing over the past 2 weeks has been unremarkable. The patient is staed on lactated Ringer's IV solution. Sterile vaginal examination shows that the patient's cervix is long, thick, and closeD. Prostaglandin (PGE2) gel is placed into the vagina, and electronic fetal heart rate monitoring is continueD. In approximately 60 minutes, the fetal heart rate falls to the 90s, as the tocodynamometer shows the uterus to be contracting every 1 minute with essentially no rest in between contractions.

It has been shown to lead to an improvement in the Bishop's score, a shoer duration of labor, and deliveries. PGE2 gel can also cause uterine contractions. One of the major side effects with PGE2 gel is uterine hyper stimulation. This occurs when uterine contractions come one right after the other, or when there is a tetanic contraction. In this setting, the fetus can become hypoxic with a resultant bradycardia. This patient had the gel placed and 60 minutes later had uterine hyperstimulation. Infection has not been shown to cause uterine hyperstimulation. This patient's group B Streptococcus colonization is likely noncontributory. IV fluids do not cause uterine hyperstimulation. Postdates pregnancy is the reason for this patient's induction and not likely the direct cause of her uterine hyperstimulation. Vaginal examination with a cervical examination can be used for fetal scalp stimulation-rubbing the baby's head to provoke an acceleration of the fetal heart rate.

In case of urinary fistulas, if the patient never needs to void as there is continuous dribbling it signifies that the fistula communicates with the bladder.

As far as urethral fistula are concerned, they give little trouble because the urethra is normally empty of urine. However, during micturition urine passes through the fistula and may then fill the vagina to dribble during body movements for a short time afterwards. This patient is developing symptoms on the seventh day can be explained by: \"Fistulas resulting from accidental, surgical and obstetrical trauma are produced in two ways. They can be caused by a direct injury such as cuts and then they manifest themselves immediately by hematuria and incontinence. Alternatively, if they are the outcome of pressure necrosis or of ischemia, in such a case urinary incontinence, fever and burning micturition develop 7-14 days after the accident. \" Before concluding let's rule out other options as well: In stress incontinence, dribbling of urine occurs only when intraabdominal pressure is raised.

All the elements of Virchow's triad are present during pregnancy viz: i. Endothelial injury? It may occur during traumatic vaginal delivery or cesarean section. ii. Stasis? Pregnancy is associated with venous stasis, especially in lower extremities because the enlarging uterus reduces blood return to the inferior vena cava by direct mechanical effect. Hormonal factors also contribute to venodilatation and stasis during pregnancy. Stasis secondary to prolonged bed rest for medical or obstetrical complications also predispose a pregnant woman to increased venous stasis and formation of vascular thrombi. iii. Increased coagulability? The maternal circulation becomes hypercoagulable as production of clotting factors like fibrinogen and factors VII.

        "question": "A 30 yrs woman 2+0, hypertension have menorrhagia. Which is best treatment for her a. EUR'",
        "exp": "MIRENA [Ref- Dewhurst text book of Gynae & Obs 7/e p. 399-404; A Comprehensive textbook of Ohs & Gynae Saillma Gupta 140, 141, 1421 The question does not give any clue regarding the aetiology of menorrhagia, so most probably the women is having D. U. B. i. e., dysfunctional uterine bleeding. When a woman present with menorrhagia, consideration must first be given to diagnosis. This requires an appropriate history and clinical examination cotnplented by suitable investigation. Anemia should be detected by full blood count and iron studies. Ultrasonography, sonohysterography and hysteroscopy are additional investigations that may diagnose a structural problem and should be utilized depending on their availability and the experience of the surgeon. Common causes of menorrhagia include local pathology such as fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis or infection. Rarer, hut impoant causes include genital malignancy (cervical, endometrial or myometrial) and systemic disorders such as thyroid disease and bleeding disorders. In over 50% cases no cause is found and the diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is made. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding requires the following criteria:- i) Complaint of excessive menstrual blood loss (menorrhgia). ii) Adequate exlusion of pathology that may otherwise cause menorrhagia. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding may be ovulatory or nonovulatory. - Anovulatory cycles results in menorrhagia with regular cycles where as - Ovulatory cycles results in menorrhagia with irregular cycles. Most of the cases of dysfunctional uterine bleeding are secondary to anovulation. - Without ovulation the corpus luteum, fails to. form resulting in no progesterone secretion. - In the absence of progesterone there is no lateral phase or the secretor), phase. - The anovulatory woman is always in the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle and in the proliferative phase of endometrial cycle. - The only ovarian steroidal signal the endometrium receives is through estrogen. - Continuous stimulation of endometrium by estrogen produces proliferation of the endometrium to abnormal levels where it becomes fragile without the growth limiting and organizing effect of progesterone. - The endometrium finally outgrows its blood supply and degenerates. The end result is asynchronous breakdown of the endometrial lining at different levels. We can conclude that bleeding in anovulatory cycle occurs due to unopposed action of estrogen in the absence of progesterone. Anovulatory menstrual cycle gives rise to irregular bleeding. On the other hand, ovulatory cycles give rise to regular menstrual bleeding. These patients ovulate regularly. These patients have both the phases of menstrual cycle i. e.,. follicular phase and the secretory phase. Research has shown that several abnormalities can occur in the endometrium of women with DUB's ovulary cycles for example increased fibrinolytic activity and increased production of prostaglandins. These observation provide the rational basis for treatment in these women i. e., - Antifibrinolytics Trenaximic acid - Prostaglandin inhibitor acid Management of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. In D. U. B's there is no specific abnormality present therefore the choice of t/t must be considered in relation to several factors:? Factors influencing tit -Presence of ovulatory or anovulatory cycles. - Need, for contraception - Patient preference - Contraindication to t/t Heavy periods Require contraception No Regular cycles Yes. L Dysmenorrhoea significant symptoms No. L Tranexanic acid Yes No Yes Combined oral contraceptive or levonorgestral releasing intrauterine system Combined oral contraceptives or cyclical progestins Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs Medical treatment can be conveniently divided into hormonal and nonhormonal:? -As there is no hormonal defect the use of hormonal therapy does not correct an underlying disorder but merely imposes and external control of the cycle. - The two main first line t/t for menorrhagias associated with ovulatory cycles are non hormonal as the ovulatory cycles usually have no defect in menstrual cycle. - They have normal menstruation and regular cycle the abnormality usually lies in increased fibrinolysis and increased production of prostaglandin. First line drugs in ovulatory cycles (menorrhagia with regular cycles) - Antifibrinolytice (Trenaxamic acid) - NSAIDSQ Trenaxamic acid reduces menstrual loss by half and NSAID reduces it by one third. Both have the advantages of only being taken during menstruation, and aid to compliance and are paicularly useful in those women who either do not require contraception or do not wish to use a hormonal therapy. They are also of value in treating excessive menstrual blood loss associated with the use of non hormonal intrauterine contraceptive device. Hormonal therapy Progesterone Traditionally hormonal therapy for menorrhagia has been progesterone given during luteal phase of the cycle. Normally progesterone therapy will control anovulatory bleeding once uterine pathology is excluded. In women who do not ovulate but are more frankly hypogonadal cyclic progesterone therapy restores the normal sequence of steroid hormone stimulation, estrogen followed by estrogen plus progesterone followed by withdrawal bleeding. Progestins are usually not effective. Despite this they remain the first choice of many general practioners and gynaecologists. Progesterones are effective when given for 21 days in each cycle but the side effects are such that patient may not choose to continue with the t/t. Although progestins have contraceptive effect but they are not the best choice when contraception required. Combined contraceptive pill They are popular first line drugs for women who desire contraception. OCP's suppress pituitary gonadotropin release preventing ovulation. Like cyclical progestins they are useful for anovulatory bleeding as they impose a cycle. Levonorgesteral intrauterine system (MIRENA) It is a T shaped intrauterine device which releases levornorgestral at the rate of 20 mcg daily. This low hormone minimizes the systemic progestinic side effects and more patients will continue this therapy than cyclic progesterones. It exes its clinical effect by preventing endometrial proliferation and consequently reduces both the duration of bleeding and the amount of menstrual loss. The levonorgestral releasing system is also advocated as an alternative to surgery. Levonorgestrel-IUD versus surgical treatments A cost-utility model study from Hong Kong repoed that over a period of five years, treatment with the LNG-IUD compared with oral medical treatment, endometrial ablation, or hysterectomy was less expensive and accrued more quality adjusted life years. It is impoant to note that cost-utility calculations may vary in different health care settings. Endometrial ablation Vs Levonorgestrol IVD For women who wish to stop using chronic medical therapy or have contraindications to medications, minimally invasive options include the LNG-IUD or endometrial ablation. A systematic review of six randomized trials and a subsequent randomized trial: found that women with menorrhagia who were treated with either the LNG-IUD or endometrial ablation had similar reductions in menstrual blood loss at 6, 12, and 24 months, as well as similar improvements in quality of life. A meta-analysis of four randomized trials found that rates of dissatisfaction were similar for women treated with the LNG-IUD (17 percent) compared with endometrial ablation (18 percent) (OR 0. 9, 95% CI 0. 5-1. 8). The decision to use the LNG-IUD or endometrial ablation depends upon a patient's preferences regarding treatment factors such as plans: for: feility and contraception, convenience, and risks of anesthesia. - The LNG-IUD is a reversible contraceptive. Pregnancy is contraindicated after endometrial ablation, but the procedure does not prevent pregnancy; thus, women will need to continue to use contraception following ablation. The LNG-IUD can be placed in an office setting for all women and requires no or local anesthesia. Endometrial ablation can also be done in an office by surgeons who are appropriately equipped, but is often performed in an operating room under general anesthesia. If successful, endometrial ablation is performed once, while the LNG-IUD needs to be replaced every live.",

The frequency of fetal death and recurrent aboion in untreated patients with antiphospholipid antibodies is greater than 90%. There are several antiphospholipid antibodies. The most relevant to obstetricians are: - The lupus anticoagulant (LAC), - The anticardiolipin antibody and - The antibody that cause false positive syphilis test (BFP-ST). The name lupus anticoagulant was derived from the fact that this antibody was found first in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and acted as an anticoagulant by prolonging the paial thromboplastin time (PTT). This name was a poor choice because soon it was found that lupus anticoagulant was present in many patients who did not have lupus and that in majority of patients the antibody was responsible for episodes of thrombosis, rather than anticoagulation. In the laboratory, LAC is not measured directly. - It is assessed by its effect on PTT and the kaolin clotting time. - Typically patients with lupus anticoagulant have a prolonged PTT and a normal PT. - Unfounately, a normal PTT does not exclude the possibility of LAC, and if the clinical suspicion is strong and the PIT is normal a kaolin clotting time or a dilute Russel viper venom time should be performed. - It has also been found that some patients with LAC and recurrent aboions have elevated values of serum 1gM. Other antiphospholipid antibodies The anticardiolipin antibody is the antiphospholipid antibody, most commonly found in patients with repetitive early pregnancy losses. Anlicardiolipin antibody is found in 90% of patients with L. A. C. but the majority of patients with positive anticardiolipin antibody do not have L. A. C. - Anticardiolipin antibody is measured in the laboratory by the ELISA test. BFP-ST - It is the less common antiphospholipid antibody. - Both BFP-ST and Anticardiolipin antibody, measure the antibody against cardiolipin but they are not the same. Clinical features of antiphospholipid antibodies. The presence of any or several of the three antiphospholipid antibodies is associated with - Recurrent early pregnancy losses. - Episodes of venous and aerial thrombosis - Severe preeclampsia - Chorea gravidarum - Pilo ischemic strokes, transient ischemic episodes, migraine headaches. - Postpaum complications such as pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and cardiac symptoms. Aboions in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome - Typically these patients give a history of a live fetus documented by ultrasound or by Doppler before demise or aboion occurs. The majority of the pregnancy losses occur between 14 and 18 weeks. Fetal death is these patients is caused by extensive thrombosis of the placental vessels and the placenta is usually smaller than expected for the gestational age.",

She has no abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. She has no other complaints. Her past medical history is significant for occasional migraine headaches. She has never had surgery. She takes acetaminophen as needed for headache, and has no known drug allergies. She works as a lawyer at a local firm and lives with her husband for three years. She has no family history of cancer or heart disease. Her vital signs are stable. Examination is significant for a bluish-appearing cervix on speculum examination. The remainder of the examination, including the abdominal examination, is benign. Laboratory evaluation shows: Urine h. CG: positive Leukocytes: 9, 000/mm3 Hematocrit: 41% Platelets: 250, 000/mm3 Pelvic ultrasound demonstrates a gestational sac with yolk sac and fetal pole surrounded by myometrium. There is a heart rate of 154 beats per minute. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "This patient's presentation, exam findings, and studies are all consistent with a diagnosis of intrauterine pregnancy. First, her presenting complaints of nausea, vomiting, and fatigue are consistent with a first trimester pregnancy. Approximately 80% of pregnant women experience some nausea during the pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. This nausea is most commonly called \"morning sickness\" but it can occur at any time during the day. Fatigue is also a common first trimester complaint. On examination she has a bluish-appearing cervix. This is called \"Chadwick's sign\" and it is another clue that she is pregnant. Most definitively, though, she has a positive urine pregnancy test. With this positive test, the diagnosis is narrowed to intrauterine pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or spontaneous aboion, with mole also being a consideration. The ultrasound that demonstrates an intrauterine pregnancy fully establishes the diagnosis. Note: Appendicitis represents an infection of the appendix. Patients with appendicitis most commonly present with symptoms and signs of infection, including abdominal pain, fever and chills, abdominal tenderness, elevated temperature, and leukocytosis. A patient with a complete hydatidiform mole will not have an intrauterine pregnancy with a fetal heart rate visualized on ultrasound examination. A complete mole often appears as a \"snowstorm\" pattern on pelvic ultrasound. It is essential to \"think ectopic! \" whenever a woman of childbearing age presents for medical attention. In fact, this sign (\"think ectopic! \") and other such similar signs can be seen in many emergency rooms. However, patients with ectopic pregnancy usually complain of abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. On examination, they will often have abdominal and adnexal tenderness. Pelvic ultrasound will show no intrauterine pregnancy. This patient, with a gestational sac, yolk sac, and fetus seen surrounded by myometrium (that is, within the uterus) can be diagnosed with an intrauterine pregnancy. Ref: Fritz D. A. (2011).

Examination shows that her cervix is 5 cm dilated, 100% effaced and the fetal heart rate is in the 130s and reactive. She is given meperidine for pain control. She progresses rapidly and less than 2 hours later she delivers a 3. 345. Kg male fetus. The one-minute APGAR score is 1 and the infant is making little respiratory effo. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "exp": "Meperidine can be used as a systemic analgesia during labor. It is an opioid and readily crosses the placenta; therefore, the fetus is exposed to the medication. As an opioid, it causes respiratory depression. Neonates are at greatest risk for respiratory depression when delivery occurs approximately 2 to 3 hours after meperidine is administered to the mother. This neonate was born approximately 2 hours after maternal administration of meperidine, which makes neonatal respiratory depression likely. Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that displaces the opioid from its receptor sites and can help to reverse the opioid- induced respiratory depression. It has a sho duration of action so repeat doses may be necessary. Blood transfusion would not be indicated. Blood transfusions are used when there is evidence that the neonate is anemic. This neonate appears to have respiratory depression and not anemia. Therefore, naloxone, and not blood transfusion, would be indicated. Glucose should be given when there is evidence that the neonate is severely hypoglycemic. This neonate, given that its mother received an opioid 2 hours ago, is most likely to have respiratory depression from the opioid and not hypoglycemia. Sodium bicarbonate should be given to a neonate for documented metabolic acidosis. It is often used during a prolonged resuscitation. The first step for this neonate, however, would be to try to reverse the respiratory depression with naloxone. Ref: Cunningham F. G., Leveno K. J., Bloom S. L., Hauth J. C., Rouse D. J., Spong C. Y.

The most common side effects are vomiting, giddiness, pain or cramps, weakness and headache. Dinoprostone is a PGE2 analogue used in cervical ripening along with misoprostol. There exists a risk for the patient to develop uterine rupture. Methotrexate is a analogue of folic acid and it prevents the synthesis of DNA by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. It is used in medical termination of pregnancy, medical management of ectopic pregnancy, prophylactic chemotherapy of hyatidiform mole and also in the treatment of placenta accreta.

Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) Hirsutism is defined as excessive growth of androgen dependant sexual hair or male distribution of hair in a female. \"The most common cause of hirsutism is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. \" \"Polycystic ovarian syndrome accounts for 70 - 80% of cases of hirsutism, with idiopathic hirsutism being the second most frequent cause. \" Pathophysiology of Hirsutism: Figure showing effect of androgen on pilosebaceous unit Ted androgen leads to Ted sebum production acne formation. It conves vellus follicles to terminal follicles leading to hirsutism. Under the influence of androgens, terminal hairs that were previously not dependent on androgens reve to a vellus form and balding results. Elevated androgen levels play a major role in determining the type and distribution of hair. Within a hair follicle, testosterone is conveed by the enzyme 5a reductase to dihydrotestosterone (active metabolite). DHT conves sho, soft vellus hair to coarse terminal hair. This conversion is irreversible. Only hairs in androgen - sensitive areas are changed in this manner to terminal hairs. The sites affected are: upper hp - chin side burns - chest lines alba of the lower abdomen Ethinicity and familial tendency also influence hirsutism. Causes of Hirsutism: Remember: Hirsutism is associated with excess androgen production (either from ovaries or adrenals), so any cause which increases androgens causes hirsutism. Most of the testosterone is bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and is considered biologically inactive. Testosterone which is not bound to SHBG is considered biologically active, therefore any factor which decreases",

D: 47, XXY Genetic analysis reveals the karyotype of klinefelter's syndrome to be 47 XXY Klinefelter syndrome/ 46 or 47, XXY/ XXY syndrome It is a condition with an extra X chromosome. Because of the extra chromosome, individuals with the condition are usually referred to as \"XXY Males\", or \"47, XXY Males\" Klinefelter syndrome is the most common sex chromosome disorder in males and the second most common condition caused by the presence of extra chromosomes. The condition exists in roughly 1 out of every 500-650 males but many of these people may not show symptoms. Principal effects include hypogonadism and reduced feility. Turner syndrome/Ullrich-Turner syndrome/Gonadal dysgenesis It encompasses several conditions in human females, of which monosomy X (absence of an entire sex chromosome, the Barr body) is most common. It is a chromosomal abnormality in which all or pa of one of the sex chromosomes is absent (unaffected humans have 46 chromosomes, of which two are sex chromosomes). Normal females have two X chromosomes, but in Turner syndrome, one of those sex chromosomes is missing or has other abnormalities. In some cases, the chromosome is missing in some cells but not others, a condition referred to as mosaicism or 'Turner mosaicism'. Occurring in 1 in 2000 -1 in 5000 phenotypic females. There are characteristic physical abnormalities, such as Sho stature, Broad chest, - Low hairline, - Low-set ears, and - Webbed necks. Girls with Turner syndrome typically experience gonadal dysfunction (non-working ovaries), which results in amenorrhea (absence of menstrual cycle) and sterility. Concurrent health concerns are also frequently present, including congenital heart disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, vision problems, hearing concerns, and many autoimmune diseases. Finally, a specific pattern of cognitive deficits is often observed, with paicular difficulties in visuospatial, mathematical, and memory areas Down syndrome/trisomy 21 Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition characterized by the presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the 21st chromosome, either in whole (trisomy 21) or pa (such as due to translocations). The incidence of Down syndrome is estimated at 1 per 733 bihs It is statistically more common with older parents due to increased mutagenic exposures upon some older parents' reproductive cells. Down syndrome is associated with some impairment of cognitive ability and physical growth, and a paicular set of facial characteristics. Individuals with Down syndrome tend to have a lower-than-average cognitive ability, often ranging from mild to moderate disabilities. The average IQ of children with Down syndrome is around 50, compared to normal children with an IQ of 100. A small number have a severe to high degree of intellectual disability Individuals with Down syndrome may have some or all of the following physical characteristics: - Microgenia (an abnormally small chin), - An unusually round face, macroglossia (protruding or oversized tongue), - An almond shape to the eyes caused by an epicanthic fold of the eyelid, Upslanting palpebral fissures (the separation between the upper and lower eyelids), Shoer limbs, - A single transverse palmar crease (a single instead of a double crease across one or both palms), - Poor muscle tone, and - A larger than normal space between the big and second toes. Health concerns for individuals with Down syndrome include a higher risk for congenital hea defects, gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrent ear infections that may lead to hearing loss, obstructive sleep apnea, thyroid dysfunctions, and obesity.",

        "question": "Which of the following is seen in the ovulatory phase:",
        "exp": "Stimulation of continuation of reduction division of oocytes Ref: Speroff Clinical Gynecologic Endocrinology & Infeility, 7/e chapter 6; Guyton 11/e p1012 The ovarian cycle can be divided into three phases: the follicular phase, ovulation, and the intent phase. The ovarian cycle depends completely on the gonadotropic hormones FSH and LH, secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. During each cycle there is a cyclical increase and decrease of both FSH and LH, as shown in the figure which causes cyclical ovarian changes. The ovaries in a newborn child contain lakhs of primordial follicles (approx 10 to 20 lakhs at the time of bih and no new primordial follicle is formed after bih). Each primordial follicle consists of an oocyte (primary oocyte), surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells. The primary oocyte in primordial follicle is arrested in the diplotene stage of meiotic prophase (of the first meiotic division). Brief review of Ougenesis: Each primary oocyte has a diploid set of chromosomes and must undergo 2 Meiotic divisions: Meiosis 1 and Meiosis II to give rise to an Ovum with a haploid set of chromosomes, necessary for feilization. Primary Oocyte --(Meiosis I) --) First Polar Body (Discarded afterward) + Secondary oocyte -- (Meiosis II)) Secondary Polar Body (Discarded afterward) + Ovum Follicular phase After pubey, in each cycle, when FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary begin to be secreted in significant amount. some of the primordial follicles (approx 6 to 12 in each cycle) begin to grow. In earliest stage of follicular phase the primary oocyte grows in size. The single layer of granulosa cells grow to form additional layers. These follicles are known as primary follicles. During the first few days of each monthly female cycle the concentration of both FSH and LH increase slightly to moderately, with the increase in FSH slightly greater than that of LH and preceeding it by a few days. These hormones especially FSH, cause accelerated growth of 6 to 12 primary follicles each month. Initially there is rapid proliferation of the granulosa cells giving rise to additional layers. In addition cells derived from the ovarian interstitium collect in several layers outside the granulosa cells, giving rise to a second mass of cells- theca. Theca is divided into 2 layers: theca interna which have the ability of secrete additional steroid sex hormones similar to the granulosa cells and theca externa which forms the capsule of the developing follicle. After the early proliferative phase of growth, lasting for a few days, the mass of granulosa cells secrets follicular fluid that contains a high concentration of estrogens. Accumulation of this fluid causes an antrum to appear within the mass of granulosa cells. FSH acts on the granulosa cells to cause secretion of estrogens. This estrogen in turn causes the granulosa cells to form increasing numbers of FSH receptors; this causes a positive feedback effect, making the granulosa cells more sensitive to FSH. The early growth of the primary follicle up to the antral stage is stimulated mainly by FSH alone. Then greatly accelerated growth occurs, leading to still larger follicles called vesicular follicles. This accelerated growth is caused by - positive feedback effect of the estrogens - FSH and estrogens combine to promote LH receptors on the granulosa cells, thus allowing LH stimulation to occur in addition to FSH stimulation and creating an even more rapid increase in the follicular secretion. After the early growth in the follicular phase, one of the follicle begins to outgrow other growing follicle Ida dominant follicle. The remaining 5 to 11 developing follicles undergo atresia. This ensures that only one follicle ruptures to liberate only one ovum for feilization. Ovulation Just before ovulation, ceain changes occur which are necessary for the ovulation. About 2 days before ovulation, the rate of secretion of LH by the anterior pituitary gland is markedly increased rising 6 to 10 folds and peaking about 16 hrs before ovulation (LH surge). FSH also increases about 2 to 3 folds at the same time and both FSH and LH act synergistically to cause rapid increase in the follicle size. The LH acts on the theca and the granulosa cells conveing them mainly to progesterone-secreting cells. Thus the estrogen level begins to fall about I day before ovulation, while progesterone level increases. Progesterone enhances the activity of proteolytic enzymes responsible, together with prostaglandins, for digestion and rupture of the follicular wall leading to ovulation. Luteal phase After expulsion of the ovum from the follicle, the remaining granulosa and theca interna cells change rapidly into lutein cells, under the influence of LH. Total mass of the remaining follicle is now termed corpus luteum. The granulosa cells secrete large amounts of female sex hormone (more progesterone than estrogens). The theca cells secrete mainly the androgens rather than the female sex hormones, but these androgens are conveed by the granulosa cells into the the female hormones. Estrogens in paicular and progesterone to a lesser extent, secreted by the corpus luteum have a strong feedback effect on the anterior pituitary gland to decrease secretions of both LH and FSH. In addition the tutein cells secrete another hormone Inhihin A. This hormone inhibits secretion of FSH by the anterior pituitary gland. Decreasing blood concentrations of both FSH and LH result in degeneration of the corpus luteum. Involution of corpus luteum results in sudden cessation of secretion of estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin A. This removes the inhibitory feedback on the anterior pituitary gland, allowing it to begin the secretion of FSH and LH again which initiate the growth of new group of follicles, thus beginning a new ovarian cycle. The paucity of secretion of progesterone and estrogens by the corpus luteum leads to menstruation by the uterus. In the background of the ovarian cycle now let's see the options given in the question. Continuation of reduction division (meiosis) occurs in the ovulatory phase As already discussed, the primary oocyte is arrested in the prophase stage of meiosis 1. Just before ovulation, the LH surge initiates the continuation of meiosis, giving rise to secondary oocyte and a polar body. The secondary oocyte enters meiosis II but gets arrested in metaphase approx. 3 hrs before ovulation. It is the secondary oocyte which is released at the time of ovulation. Meiosis II is completed only if the oocyte is feilized by a sperm, otherwise the cell degenerates. Inhibin A is increased in the Luteal phase There are 2 forms of inhihin: Inhibin A and Inhibin B Inhibin B is predominantly secreted by the granulosa cells in the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle. Inhibin A secretions begin to rise in the late follicular phase and reach a peak level in the midluteal phase. Inhibin-A, causes suppression of FSH levels during the luteal phase, which contribute to transition from luteal to follicular phase (of the next cycle). The role of Inhibin B is in securing the dominance of the dominant follicle and leading to atresia of the other growing follicles. FSH increases steroid synthesis in granulosa cells FSH acts on the granulosa cells to cause production of female sex hormones- both estrogens and progesterone. Although: production of these steroids are seen in all 3 phases of the ovarian cycle; it occurs mainly in the follicular phase. Activin causes FSH to act on the granulosa cells Activin is one of the peptides secreted by granulosa cells under the influence of FSH. Activin in turn augments FSH action on the granulosa cells and also increases FSH release from the pituitary. Thus it has a positive feedback effect. Role of activin is mainly seen in the follicular phase.",

Only the anterior pituitary is affected because in paurient woman, blood supply to the pituitary gland is modified to the advantage of the posterior lobe and disadvantage of the anterior lobe so, when spasm occurs, posterior lobe is protected. When 75% of Anterior pituitary is destroyed, manifestations of Sheehan's syndrome appear and when 95% is destroyed -- fully developed Simmonds syndrome is seen. Hormones of Anterior Pituitary are affected in order of frequency = GH, FSH and LH, TSH and ACTH. Clinical Features: SymptomsQ Failure of lactation after deliverydeg Secondary amenorrhoeadeg Loss of libidodeg Increased sensitivity to cold (hypothydroidism)deg Signs: Absence of axillary sweatingdeg 1 Loss of axillary and pubic hairdeg Signs of adrenal coical failure Decrease in skin pigmentationdeg I Anemia due to lack of pituitary erythropoeitic factor Weakness, lethargydeg Hypothermiadeg Hypoglycemiadeg (due to decreased insulin tolerance)deg Hypothyroidismdeg All genital organs show atrophy, uterus is smaller than in postmenopausal womendeg as there is decrease in FSH, LH $ estrogen Although dormant ovaries retain their ova till menopausedeg Lab investigation: FSH LH TSH ACTH 1deg Oestrogens J. deg Urinary 17 keto steroids, 1, deg Management: The treatment of Sheehan's syndrome includes: Life long hormone substitute including estrogen,",

All of you know - contraction stress test \"The contraction stress test (CST) is based on the response of FHR to uterine contractions, with the premise that fetal oxygenation will be worsened. This results in late decelerations in an already suboptimally oxygenated fetus. The test requires 3 contractions in 10 minutes, a positive or abnormal test is when late decelerations occur with more than half of the contractions, suspicious with any late decelerations, and negative with no late decelerations. \" COGDT 10/e, p 255 So here is our answer, the most significant finding for hypoxia is late deceleration. Our answer is further supported by COGDT 10/e, p 257. \"Late decelerations are smooth falls in the FHR begining after the contractions has started and ending after the contractions has ended. They are associated with fetal hypoxemia and potential for perinatal morbidity and mortality. Variable decelerations are abrupt in decline and return to baseline, vary in timing with the contractions, and usually represents cord compression. \" As far as sinusoidal pattern is concerned - Williams Obs. 23/e, p 420 says \"Intrapartum sinusoidal fetal heart patterns were not generally associated with fetal compromise\".",

(Option \"c\") As far as age is concerned: Telinde operative gynaecology 9/e. p 196 says: \"Young age has been considered a risk factor for vaginal posthysterectomy infection, although the exact reason is unclear. \" And table in Williams Gynae lie. p 77 gives old age as a risk factors for abdominal hysterectomy and young age as a risk factor for vaginal hysterectomy.

        "exp": "Ans. is d i. e. HPV 6 \"Low Risk HPV types 6 and 11 cause nearly all genital was. \" Details of Genital Was: Genital was are leisons created from productive infection with HPV (most common type 6 and 11). They display various morphologies and appearances ranging from flat papules to the classic verrucous, polyphytic lesions, termed condyloma acuminata\". Sites: External genital was may develop at sites in the lower reproductive tract, urethra, anus, or mouth. Diagnosis: They are typically diagnosed by clinical infection, and biopsy is nor required unless co-existing neoplasia is suspected. HPV serotyping is not required for routine diagnosis. Treatment: - Condyloma acuminata may remain unchanged or resolve spontaneously Effect of treatment on future viral transmission is unclear. However, many women prefer removal, and lesions can be destroyed with sharp or electrosurgical excision, cryotherapy, or laser ablation. In addition, very large. bulky lesions may be managed with cavitational ultrasonic surgical aspiration. Alternatively, 5-percent imiquimod cream is a immunomodulatory topical treatment for genital was. Other topical agents which may be applied for treatment of was are: Podophyllin which is a antimitoric agent available in a 10 to 25% tinctute of benzoin solution and disrupts viral activity by inducing local tissue necrosis. Alternatively, trichloroacetic acid and bichloroacetic acid are proteoplytic agents and are applied serially to was by clinicians. Intralesion injection of interferon is also an effective treatment for was. However as this method has high cost, is painful and is inconvenient to administer, So this therapy is not recommended as a primary modality and is best reserved for recalcirrant cases. Of therapy choice no data suggest the superiority of one treatment. Thus in general treatment should be selected based on clinical circumstances and patient and provider preferences.",

Thyroid studies also may be appropriate. A complete pelvic examination is appropriate if the patient has been sexually active, is having severe pain, or an anomaly is suspected. Cultures for gonorrhea and testing for chlamydia infection are appropriate if the patient has been sexually active. Some young teens who have a history that is classic for anovulation, who deny sexual activity, and who agree to return for follow-up evaluation may be managed with a limited gynecologic examination and pelvic ultrasonography Imaging Studies If the pregnancy test is positive, pelvic imaging using ultrasonography may be necessary to confirm a ble intrauterine pregnancy and rule out a spontaneous aboion or ectopic pregnancy. If a pelvic mass is suspected on examination, or if the examination is inadequate (more likely to be the case in an adolescent than an older woman) and additional information is required, pelvic ultrasonography may be helpful Management Management of bleeding abnormalities related to pregnancy, thyroid dysfunction, hepatic abnormalities, hematologic abnormalities, or androgen excess syndromes should be directed to treating the underlying condition. Oral contraceptives can be extremely helpful in managing androgen excess syndromes. After specific diagnoses have been ruled out by appropriate laboratory testing, anovulation or dysfunctional bleeding becomes the diagnosis of exclusion.",

Histopathologically a pa or the full thickness of cervical squamous epithelium is replaced by cells showing varying degree of dysplasia, with intact basement membrane. CIN may be suspected through cytological examination using the Pap smear test or through colposcopic examination. Cervical cytology is the most efficacious and cost-effective method for cancer screening. Final diagnosis of CIN is established by the histopathological examination of a cervical punch biopsy or excision specimen. Additionally, human papilloma virus (HPV) testing can be performed in order to better triage women with early cytologic changes. Cervical Cytology Screening (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Guideline) Initial screening Age 21 or 3 y after vaginal sex Interval Every year Every 2-3 y after age 30 with 3 consecutive normals Discontinue No upper limit of age Comparison of Cytology Classification Systems (in simplified form) Bathesda CIN llysplasia Limit of histologic changes *LSIL CIN 1 Mild Basal 1/3rd of sq. epithelium HSIL ON 2 Moderate Basal 1/2 to 2/3rd CIN3 Severe Whole thickness except one or two superficial layers CIS Whole thickness LSIL - Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion HSIL - High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion CIS - Carcinoma in situ *LSIL incorporates HPV changes (koilocytotic atypia) along with CIN I. Role of HPV HPV infection is found in approx. 90% cases of intraepithelial neoplasia. Type H&18 are most commonly associated. HPV-18 is more specific than HPV-16 for invasive tumors. In most women, the HPV infection clears in 9 to 15 months. Only a minority of women exposed to HPV develop persistent infection that may progress to CIN. Type-16 is the most common HPV type found in women with normal cytology. Treatment CIN 1 Spontaneous regression of CIN 1 is seen in 60% to 85% of cases, typically within 2yrs. So patients who have biopsy diagnoses of C1N 1 are kept under observation with: Pap testing performed at 6 and 12 months Or HPV DNA testing at 12 months After two negative test results or a single negative HPV DNA test, annual screening may be resumed. Women with persistent CIN 1 after 24 months should be treated with a local ablative method. CIN 2 and3 CIN 2&3 carries a much higher probability of progressing to invasive cancer. All CIN 2 and 3 lesions require t reatment. LEEP ( loop electrosurgical excision procedure) is the preferred treatment for CIN 2 and 3. Because all therapeutic modalities carry an inherent recurrence rate of upto 10%. cytologic follow-up at about 3-month intervals for 1 year is necessary. Cryotherapy Considered acceptable therapy when the following criteria are met: - Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 1 to 2 - Small lesion Ectocervical location only - Negative endocervical sample - No endocervical gland involvement on biopsy Laser Ablation It has been used effectively for the treatment of CIN. But because of the expense of the equipment as well as necessity for special training, laser ablation has fallen out of or. Laser has been widely replaced by LEEP. Laser Excisional Conization Rather than using laser for vaporization leading to ablation, it can be used to excise a conization specimen. The ease of LEEP conization has significantly reduced the indications of laser conization. Loop electrosurgical excision( LEEP) LEEP, variably known as simply loop excision or LLETZ (large loop excision of the transformation zone), is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and treatment of CIN. It uses low-voltage, high-frequency, thin wire loop electrodes to perform a targeted removal of a cervical lesion, an excision of the transformation zone, or a cervical conization. This technique can be used in the outpatient setting Cold knife conization (scalpel) Conization is both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure and has the advantage over ablative therapies of providing tissue for fuher evaluation to rule out invasive cancer. Conization is indicated for CIN 2&3 in following conditions: - Limits of the lesion cannot be visualized with colposcopy. - The squat-no-columnar junction (SCE) is not seen at colposcopy. - Endocervical curettage (ECC) histologic findings are positive for CIN 2 or CIN 3. - There is a substantial lack of correlation between cytology, biopsy, and colposcopy results. - Microinvasion is suspected based on biopsy, colposcopy, or cytology results. - The colposcopist is unable to rule out invasive cancer.",

Clinical examination and pap smear Well friends first I want you to read what Williams has to say on Postcoital bleeding. \"Bleeding following intercourse most commonly develops in women aged 20 to 40 years and in those who are multiparous. No underlying pathology is identified in up to two thirds. If an identifiable lesions is found, however, it typically is benign. In a review of 248 women with postcoital bleeding. Selo-Ojeme and co-workers (2004) found that a fouh of cases were caused by cervical eversion. Other causes included endocervical polyps, cervicitis, and less commonly, endometrial polyps. In the cases of cervicitis. Chlamydia trachomatis is a frequent cause. In some women, postcoital bleeding may be from cervical or other genital tract neoplasia. The epithelium associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cancer is thin and friable and readily detaches from the cervix. In women with postcoital bleeding. CIN was found in to 10 percent, invasive cancer in about 5 percent, and vaginal or endometrial cancer in <1 percent. In another study, Jha and Sabharwal (2002) repoed that a number of women with postcoital bleeding had pathologic lesions identified at colposcopic evaluation that had been missed by Pap smear screening. Thus, most women with unexplained postcoital bleeding should undergo colposcopic examination if no other obvious souce of bleeding is identified. \" So after reading the above text it is clear that - Colposocopy is the most definitive procedure for diagnosis of postcoital bleeding. But here question is specifically saying - a 35 years old female is coming with postcoital bleeding, what is the next step - so obviously in this age group we will first examine the patient, rule out other causes, perform a pap's and still if no diagnosis is made we will go for colposocpy to rule out CIN and Ca cervix.",

It is defined as a multi-system disorder of unknown etiology characterised by development of hypertension to the extent of 140/90 mm Hg or more with proteinuria after the 20th week of pregnancy in a previously normotensive and a normoproteinuric patient. The typical pathological features are endothelial dysfunction and intense vasospasm. In pre-eclampsia, the glomerular filtration rate decreases. The decrease in glomerular filtration rate is as a result of the following physiological changes: Afferent glomerular aeriolar vasospasm Occlusion of the lumen of the glomerulus resulting from glomerular endotheliosis and fibrin deposits in the basement membrane Decreased renal blood flow Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics By D.

Accumulation of fat droplets occurs within the cytoplasm of the epithelium of the lobules during the third trimester.
