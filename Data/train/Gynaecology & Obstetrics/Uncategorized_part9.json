D: Rh positive father, Rh negative mother Rho(D) Immune Globulin is given by intramuscular injection that is used to prevent the immunological condition known as Rhesus disease (or hemolytic disease of newborn) paicularly when father is Rh positive and mother is Rh negative. It is a solution of IgG anti-D (anti-RhD) antibodies that bind to, and lead to the destruction of, fetal Rh D positive red blood cells that have passed from the fetal circulation to the maternal circulation. Therefore, in a Rhesus negative mother it can prevent sensitization of the maternal immune system to Rh D antigens, which can cause rhesus disease in the current or in subsequent pregnancies",

The pathophysiology of fetal macrosomia is not very clear but it seems clear that fetal hyperinsulinemia is one driving force. The insulin like growth factor, as well as fibroblast growth factor, also are involved, so a hyperinsulinemic state with increased levels of some growth factors, with increased expression of GLUT proteins in syncytiotrophoblast, may promote excessive fetal growth. It could also be due to elevated levels of maternal free fatty acid which leads to its increased transfer to the fetus accelerating triglyceride synthesis and resulting in adiposity.
