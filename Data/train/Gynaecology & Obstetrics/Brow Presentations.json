        "exp": "Ans. (b) Partial extension. Ref. William's Obstetrics 23rd ed. Ch 17* In cephalic presentation, the fetal head may assume a position between these extremes:# Vertex presentation: Head is flexed sharply so that the chin is in contact with the thorax. The occipital fontanel is the presenting part, and this presentation is referred to as a vertex or occiput presentation.# Sinciput/Military presentation: Partially flexed head in some cases, with the anterior (large) fontanel, or bregma, as presenting.# Brow presentation: head is partially extended (see Fig).# These two presentations (sinciput and brow) are usually transient. As labor progresses, sinciput and brow presentations almost always convert into vertex or face presentations by neck flexion or extension, respectively.# Face presentation: Much less commonly, the fetal neck may be sharply extended so that the occiput and back come in contact, and the face is foremost in the birth canal, giving it the face presentation.",
