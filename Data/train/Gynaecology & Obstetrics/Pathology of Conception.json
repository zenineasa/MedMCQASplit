        "exp": "Ans. c. FSH /Ref Harrison 19e p2388, 18/e p17/e p2331]. Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce egg. The methods for assessing ovarian reserve are classified into Passive testing and Dynamic testing. FSH level is a method for testing passive ovarian reserve. \"As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. Rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompanied by a decline in oocyte quality. High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy. \"Ovarian reserve* Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce egg* During the first few days of each monthly cycle, under the influence of FSH and LH there is rapid growth of several follicles in the ovaiy. After a week or more of growth one of the follicles begin to outgrow. AH the others and the remaining follicles involute (a process called atresia), and these follicles are said to become atretic.* The process of atresia is important because it normally allow s only one of the follicles to grow large enough, each month to ovulate. This usually prevents more than one child from developing with each pregnancy.* The single follicle reaches a diameter of l-l. 5 centimeters at the time of ovulation and is called the mature follicle.* With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce eggs declines. Methods of assessing ovarian reserve:* With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce egg declines i. e. ovarian reserve decrease with age.* Usually age is the best predictor of ovarian reserve but approximately 10% of women have an accelerated loss of ovarian reserve by their mid-30. So age alone does not tell the whole story. Consequently more refined methods for predicting ovrian reserve have been developed.* Goal of methods for assessing ovarian reserve is to provide information regarding oocyte quality and quantity. Methods for Assessing Ovarian Reserve. Passive testing. Dynamic testing. FSH level:* Early folloicular phase FSH levels play an important role in pregnancy outcomes.* As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. Rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompanied by a decline in oocyte quality.* High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy. Measurement of Inhibin B:* Inhibin B is an ovarian hormone that inhibits FSH release. Although present in ovulating women it is not normally found in postmenopausal women.* Low inhibin levels suggests poor ovarian reserve. Transvaginal ultrasound:* Diminshed ovarian reserve means that fewer follicles are available for stimulation and recruitment by fertility drugs.* Transvaginal ultrasound allows the observation of ovaries and assess the number of follicles (ovarian volume.). Ciomiphene citrate challenge test:* Clomiphene is an antiestrogen which inhibits the negative feedback of estrogen on hypothalamus i. e. the hypothalamus gets false signals that the patient does not have enough estrogen. In response, the hypothalamus induces the pituitary gland to produce more FSH and LH. This is turn initiates follicular growth to produce estrogen.* Clomiphene is able to exert this effect only when the estrogen level is low or the ovarian reserve is low.* In a normal woman with adequate ovarian reserve there is enough inhibin and estrogen to suppress FSH production through negative feedback and resist the effects clomiphene.* When undergoing clomiphene citrate challenge test. the first step is to measure day 3 FSH and estrogen. Then 100 mg of clomiphere is administered on cycle day 5 through 9 and FSH and estrogen measurement are repeated on cycle day 10.* In general, a high day 10 FSH suggests poor ovarian reserve.",

There is initial suppression of LH with low levels of estradiols. It switches to positive feedback when estradiol levels reach 200 pg/ml.

        "question": "A 26-year old primigravida with severe rheumatic heart disease (mitral stenosis with mitral regurgitation) is in early labour. The obstetrician wants to try a normal labour. Which of the following is the ideal intervention for labour analgesia?",
        "exp": "Ans. is Neuraxial analgesia Pain and anxiety during labour and delivery provoke catecholamine surge resulting in tachycardia, hypertension increased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance. This may prove to be catastrophic for patients with heart disease who may develop ischemia or heart failure.* This can be prevented by providing adequate labour analgesia. Earlier spinal neuraxial blockade was used for this purpose. It was believed that sympathetic neuraxial blockade will provide adequate analgesia. However, sympathetic blockade caused by standard neuraxial techniques can produce dramatic cardiovascular changes with decrease in cardiac output secondary to a reduction in preload following sympathetic blockade. Standard spinal blockade is considered a cardiovascular risk due to the sympathetic blockade that decreases cardiac preload by causing arteriolar dilatation. Arteriolar dilatation will reduce systemic vascular resistance and may cause reflex tachycardia. Standard spinal block may produce following changes: -Low systemic vascular resistance can reverse the pressure gradient across a left to right intracardiac shunt, leading to catastrophic decrease in pulmonary blood flow. These changes are usually more severe with a single shot spinal anaesthesia compared with central neuraxial blockade. However, in the last few years, neuraxial blockade has benefitted from important technical and pharmacological improvements that allow it to be tailored to the patients' needs and obstetric course. Safe neuraxial techniques avoid standard techniques with fixed doses and instead should tailor the anaesthetic to the patient. Single shot spinal anaesthesia is not recommended for the cardiac pregnant patient, in contrast a well-controlled epidural or spinal anaesthesia is beneficial even for the most severe cardiac disease. If a rapid decrease in preload and afterload are likely to compromise cardiac status then local anaesthetic is eliminated from the intrathecal portion of the spinal epidural (CSE) and only intrathecal opioid is administered. In these patients the epidural should be dosed slowly with local anaesthetic to maintain stable hemodynamics and adequate uteroplacental blood flow. The technique carries the risk of potential delay in the discovery of poorly placed epidural catheter after a combined spinal epidural (CSE): however, epidural catheters placed during a CSE are less likely to fail. If neuraxial analgesia is not an option for a high-risk cardiac patient, then the advisability of vaginal delivery may need to be considered. Although patient controlled analgesia (PCA) via intravascular opioid infusion with remifantil or fentanyl is performed in many patients, this may not be good alternative for the cardiac patient. Pain control is typically suboptimal leading to increased catecholamine release. Furthermore to achieve, even moderately effective analgesia, the dose of opioid required could suppress ventilation. The resultant carbon di-oxide retention can cause respiratory acidosis, further catecholamine release and increase pulmonary hypertension leading to arrhythmias, ischemia, or heart, failure. Mitral stenosis. The main goal of anaesthetic technique is to avoid \"tachycardia\" as the time required for left ventricular diastolic filling is prolonged. Segmental epidural anaesthesia is recommended early during labour, avoiding significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance with reflex tachycardia. Cesarean section is also managed with segmental epidural anaesthesia. Phenylephrine is the vasopressor of choice. Patients with prominent symptoms are at significant risk in peripartum period and should receive peripheral and pulmonary artery catheter monitoring continued for a minimum of 24 hour after delivery since tolerance to postpartum fluid shifts may be poor. Mitral regurgitation. Mitral insufficiency as well as mitral value prolapsed are well tolerated by the pregnant patient since a decrease in SVR will reduce the regurgitant flow. Atrial arrhythmias and risk of embolism from atrial thrombi are important complications. Pain will automatically increase systemic vascular resistance and adequate labour analgesia should minimize peripheral vasoconstriction and thus avoid an increase in left ventricular after load associated with labour pain. Additional sympathetic blockade further decreases systemic vascular resistance. Neuraxial techniques are indicated for labour, vaginal delivery and cesarean section.",
