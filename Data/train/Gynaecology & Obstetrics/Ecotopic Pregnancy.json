Thus, Transvaginal tubal catheterization or hysteroscopy and Tuboplasty have less success rate than IVF, hence IVF would be the best treatment option for her.c. Proximal tubal occlusions may be approached employing several different therapeutic approaches. In vitro fertilization techniques and microsurgical oviduct reconstruction with reimplantation techniques are two established modalities. Transcervical fallopian tube recanalization techniques now offer a third therapeutic alternative.d.
