This situation necessitates the careful monitoring of both folate and phenytoin levels after therapy is initiated. The normal range for folate is 5 to 25 ng/mL. Additionally, phenytoin therapy may increase the metabolism of vitamin D, leading to a decrease in vitamin D levels that can in turn cause alterations in calcium homeostasis that lead to osteomalacia and osteoporosis.
