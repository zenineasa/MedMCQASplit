But if you really want to understand and know what is trophoblast and how it forms the placenta and fetal membranes, you will have to revise embryology with me: As feilisation of the ovum occurs and a zygote is formed. it undergoes cleavage to form 3. 4. 6 cell stage. This cleavage continues till it is 16 cell staged and is called as Morula. Cells of morula differentiates into an inner cell mass which is completely surrounded by an outer layer of cells. The cells of the outer layer give rise to a structure called as the trophoblast The trophoblast has the propey of being able to stick to uterine (or other) epithelium and invade and burrow the tissues with which they come in contact. Therefore to prevent this 'sticking' - trophoblast is surrounded by zona pellucida. Some fluid passes from the uterine cavity into the morula. So that the inner cell mass attaches to trophoblast on one side only. The morula now becomes a blastocysf. As the blastocyst develops fuher the inner cell mass differentiates into ectoderm and endoderm initially followed by mesoderm later. The trophoblast gives origin to amnion, chorion and the placenta. Extra Edge Development of the embryo from feilisation up to the formation of bilaminar disc is described as the 'pre - organogenesis period These events take place in the first 14 days of pregnancy. Anomalies produced by teratogens acting during this period usually result in death of the embryo. These anomalies are therefore seldom seen in babies reaching full term. Establishment of the primitive streak and formation of intra embryonic mesoderm mark the onset of \"gastrulation\"or the \"embryonic period\" (from the 3r0 week to flth week). Most congenital anomalies are produced by teratogens acting during this period. Time table of events Age in days Developmental Events 2 Embryo is at two - cell stage 3 Morula is formeddeg 4 Blastocyst is formed 8 Bilaminar disc is formeddeg 14 Prochordal plate and primitive streak is seen 16 Intra-embryonic mesoderm is formed / disc is now three layereddeg",

Progesterone does have a role in prefer'', labour According to American college of obs and Gynae (ACOG) progesterone is given in patients with history of previous preterm labour and in women who are at risk for preterm labour (i. e., women with sho cervix). - In these patients progesterone administration stas from 16th month and is continued up to 36 months progesterone acts by reducing uterine contractions. An impoant point Progesterone reduces or prevents uterine contractions when the uterine contractions are not fully established but once the labour sets in i. e., regular uterine contractions sta progesterone has no role. - Progesterone cannot prevent regular uterine contractions of labour. We are not sure from the question, what they want to ask. The question does not clearly differentiate if they are asking about uterine contractions of pregnancy or labour. Once again remember If labour has begun, progesterone has no use. Among other tocolytics, calcium channel blockers have the least side effects. It is an effective tocolytic that is well tolerated by the majority of the pregnant patient. No significant fetal problems have been repoed after treatment with Nifedipine. The most common side effect seen with Nifedipine is lowering of B. P, facial flushing can be seen in ceain cases.

Friends, Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is an impoant and emerging topic for PGME exams. It is one of the least touched topic at undergraduate level. Therefore, I am explaining it in detail. Do go through it: Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: It is a treatable, autoimune disorder associated with recurrent second trimester pregnancy loss. deg Antiphospholipid antibodies are acquired antibodies targeted against a phospholipid. They can be IgM, IgG or IgA isotopes. Most impoant antiphospholipid antibodies are: Lupus anticoagulant (LAC) -- It was named so because it was first found in patients with SLE & prolonged paial thromboplastin time -- But the name is a misomer as though it increases PTT (i. e., similar to anticoagulant) but functions as a procoagulant & causes thrombosis Anticardiolipin antibody - It is most commonly seen in patients with repetitive early pregnancy loss BFP - ST i. e. antibody which causes biologically false positive syphilis test -- Less common antiphospholipid antibody - Both anticardio lipin & BFPST antibodies measure the antibody against cardiotipin but they are not same. Diagnosis For diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome there should be two positive tests 6 weeks apa for lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibody. Mqrpclerrient 7 Treatment as proposed by ACOG is a combination of low dose aspirin (81 mg) daily and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in prophylactic doses (e. g. dalteparin 5000 units S/C twice daily), staed as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Aspirin can be initiated preconceptionaly and is usually discontinued at 36 weeks. LMWH is continued up to term and for 5 days postpaum. Women with previous history of thrombosis will usually already be on maintenance therapy with warfarin. In such cases as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, warfarin is changed to LMWH and aspirin. Although this treatment improves overall pregnancy success, these women remain at high risk for preterm labor, PROM. IUGR. preeclampsia and placental abruption. In question 10 Patient is presenting with recurrent aboions with isolated increase in APTT which leaves no doubt that lupus anticoagulant is the cause.",

Clinical features Obstetric cholestasis most commonly presents in the third trimester (80% develop symptoms after 1st week). The pruritus is often severe and typically the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet are involved but the legs, thighs arms, backs, breasts and abdomen are also repoed. The diseaes tends to recur in every pregnancy and so a pa history of the condition is impoant. The disease is more common among multiple gestations. Other signs and symptoms of liver disease are not observed. Additional symptoms which may be repoed in common with other forms of cholestasis are right upper quadrant pain, pale stools and dark urine. Changes in liver function in obstetric cholestasis The most common abnormalities in liver function are - Increase in ALT (seen in 100% cases) - Increase in AST (seen in 99% cases) - Increase in bile acids (seen in 92% cases) - Elevated bilirubin (22% of cases) - Increased GGT (39% cases) Elevations in alkaline phosphatase are seen in cholestatic disease such as obstetric cholestasis as it is released from the damaged liver but because the enzyme is also released from the placenta in normal pregnancies, measurements are less helpful than outside the pregnancy. Serum bile acid test is the most accurate determinant of cholestasis of pregnancy. The problem with the bile acid test is that only a small number of labs around the world have the equipment necessary to perform it which can result in a considerable delay for women experiencing symptoms of the conditions. Liver biopsy in a case of obstetric cholestasis:? Liver biopsy demonstrates:? - Acinar cholestasis with centrilobular bile staining and bile plugs in the canaliculi. Liver biopsy is the definitive diagnostic test of the disease. Postnatal course in obstetric cholestasis - Biochemical abnormalities and pruritius in obsetric cholestasis persists until delivery following which resolution occurs. - Pruritus is typically absent within 48 hour after delivery usually improved within 1 week. - Liver function tests becomes normal within 6 weeks. Complications of obstetric cholestasis - Meconium stained liquor - Premature delivery - Fetal distress - Post paum hemorrhage Treatment of obstetric cholestasis: - i) Antihistamines - Chlorpheniramine can provide symptomatic relief in pruritus. ii) Topical treatments - If the skin is well moistured pruritus may be relieved. iii) Ursodeoxycholic acid iv) S-Adenosyl methiomine v) Dexamethasone - Dexamethasone in high dose results in resolution of all pruritus cases and significant reduction in total bile acids and ALT. vi) Vitamin K - In obstetric cholestasis there is malabsorption and subsequent deficiency of vitamin K. This will increase the risk of postpaum hemorrhage. - Vitamin K injection is given to reduce the risk of PPH.",

The remaining 5 percent implant in the ovary, peritoneal cavity, or within the cervix. Beta h. CG in the urine and serum, empty uterus, adnexal mass, decidual casts and free fluid in peritoneal cavity is pathognomonic of ectopic pregnancy. A trilaminar endometrial pattern is unique for diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy-its specificity is 94 percent, but with a sensitivity of only 38 percent. A decidual cyst is identified as an anechoic area lying within the endometrium but remote from the canal and often at the endometrial-myometrial border. This finding represents early decidual breakdown and precedes decidual cast formation. Also Know: All pregnancies induce an endometrial decidual reaction, and sloughing of the decidua can create an intracavitary fluid collection called a pseudogestational sac, or pseudosac. When a pseudosac is noted, the risk of ectopic pregnancy is increased. Ref: Cunningham F. G., Leveno K. J., Bloom S. L., Hauth J. C., Rouse D. J., Spong C. Y. (2010). Chapter 10. Ectopic Pregnancy.

It can also be seen in Brenner's tumour and Granulosa cell tumour where it is called as Pseudomeig's syndrome. Hydrothorax can be bilateral also. True meig's syndrome is rare, occuring in < 5 per cent of fibromas. Ascites is caused by transudation of fluid from the ovarian fibroma. Hydrothorax develops secondary to flow of ascitic fluid into the pleural space lymphatics of the diaphragm. Ascites occurs (in 50% cases) when tumour size is > 6 cms. Tumours producing Meig's syndrome manifest in the late childbearing period i. e., 30 - 40 years. Both ascites and hydrothorax resolve spontaneously after removal of the tumour. Criteria for diagnosis of Meig's syndrome: Tumour must be ovarian, solid and benign. Both hydrothorax and ascites must be present. Removal of the tumour must result in their spontaneous and permanent cure. Pseduomeig syndrome: Can be seen in association with either benign or malignant tumour. Hydrothorax could be a manifestation of pulmonary metastasis. Syndrome can result from overstimulation of the ovaries with gonadotropins but, in such cases, the peritoneal exudate is more likely to be caused by an electrolyte imbalance rather than by ovarian tumour.",

        "question": "A 25 year old woman complains of abdominal pain of rapid onset in the right lower quadrant. She subsequently undergoes surgery for suspected acute appendicitis. At surgery, however, a tubal pregnancy is discovered. The most frequent predisposing factor for this condition is?",
        "exp": "The great majority of ectopic pregnancies (90%) occur in the fallopian tubes. The other sites are the ovaries, abdominal cavity, and the intrauterine segment of the fallopian tubes. Any condition that leads to anatomical abnormalities of the uterus and fallopian tubes may predispose to ectopic pregnancy. The most frequent of such conditions is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is usually associated with salpingitis. PID is a common infectious condition most frequently caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, both sexually transmitted. Other cases are due to a polymicrobial population, including staphylococci, streptococci, coliform bacteria, and Clostridium perfringens, acquired during aboion or delivery. PID leads to acute purulent salpingitis. If this is untreated or inadequately treated, it progresses to salpingo-oophoritis, tubal abscesses, pyosalpinx, or hydrosalpinx. Even milder cases may cause adhesions within the tube or between the tube and the ovary that interfere with implantation of the ovum and result in tubal pregnancy. All the remaining conditions listed above may also predispose to ectopic pregnancy. Endometriosis refers to the presence of endometrium in abnormal locations, such as the ovary, uterine ligaments, rectovaginal pouch, and pelvic peritoneum. It is an impoant clinical condition manifesting with pain, dysmenorrhea, and infeility. Scarring at endometriotic sites may cause peritubal adhesions and ectopic pregnancy. An intrauterine device may also increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy, but the mechanism of action is not clear. Leiomyomas of the uterus are the most frequent benign tumor in women. They develop from the smooth muscle as well-circumscribed nodules within the uterine wall (intramural), in a subserosal or submucosal location. Leiomyomas may cause significant distoion of the uterine wall and interfere with implantation, increasing the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Ref: Cunningham F. G., Leveno K. J., Bloom S. L., Hauth J. C., Rouse D. J., Spong C. Y. (2010). Chapter 10. Ectopic Pregnancy. In F. G. Cunningham, K. J. Leveno, S. L. Bloom, J. C. Hauth, D. J. Rouse, C. Y. Spong (Eds), Williams Obstetrics, 23e.",

        "exp": "Follow up This patient has stage Ib Ca cervix (i. e. clinical lesion confined to cervix). Management of Ca cervix consists of Primary management and Post-op management. Primary Mx of Ib Radical hysterectomy + lymphadenectomy (detailed Mx of Ib described ahead) Post surgical management depends on presence or absence of risk factors. So here this patient has stage Ib Ca cervix - She has undergone total radical hysterectomy, which is the appropriate primary management. Post-op it is found that carcinoma is extending to lower pa of body of uterus. This is the tricky pa of the question. - an extension to uterus is given no consideration in FIGO clinical staging of Ca Cervix. Fuhermore Novak writes - \"After a clinical stage is assigned and treatment has been initiated the stage must not be changed because of subsequent findings of either extended clinical staging or surgical staging\". So a finding of uterus involvement is not going to change the stage or the management. Post op. management (i. e. either follow up, radiotherapy or chemoradiation) is going to be determined by presence or absence of risk factors. In the question, no risk factor has been mentioned (uterine involvement is not a risk factor). So we assume that none are present and hence fuher management would be -> 'follow up' Management of Ca Cervix Primary Management of Note - Radiotherapy can also be used for stages la to Ila if patient is medically inooperable. Trachelectomy or cervicectomy refers to surgical removal of cervix. In radical trachelectomy parametria and vaginal cuff are also excised along with removal of cervix. This is a feility preserving alternative to radical hysterectomy in younger patients with early stage carcinoma. Types of hysterectomy Type I - Simple (extrafascial) hysterectomy routinely done for benign conditions for e. g. fibroid. Type II - (Weheim's or modified radical hysterectomy) In type II along with hysterectomy, medial half of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments and proximal 1-2 cm of vagina are also removed. Type III - (Meigs radical hysterectomy) It includes removal of most of the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments and the upper one third of the vagina. Both type II & type III hysterectomy includes pelvic lymph node dissection. Type IV - (extended radical hysterectomy) In type IV, the periureteral tissue, superior vesical aery, and as much as 3/4th of vagina in addition are removed. Type V (paial exenteration) - Poions of the distal ureter and bladder are resected. Type IV & V are rarely performed because radiotherapy is more adequate treatment in extensive disease. These factors are seen during histopathological examination of specimens (uterus, cervix, parametria, vaginal cuff, lymph nodes etc.) of radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy.

        "exp": "Ans. C: IgM antibodies in fetus reflects immunity Fetal rubella syndrome is a congenital disorder resulting from primary maternal infection with the rubella virus. It is characterized mainly by deafness, mental retardation, congenital cataract, heart defects, and other structural anomalies that may be found with variable severity and frequency. During acute rubella in pregnancy, the rate of congenital infection is over 90% in the 12 first weeks of pregnancy, approximately 60% in weeks 13 to 17, 25% in weeks 18 to 24 and then increases again during the last month of pregnancy. Etiology: It is caused by a RNA togavirus, which is the only member of the genus Rubivirus. The fetus is infected by transplacental transmission. Administration of rubella vaccine has significantly reduced the incidence of maternal infection, although reinfection after vaccination is possible. The development of fetal infection reaches 50% among those exposed during the first trimester and 20% during the second trimester. Diagnosis: The most frequent sonographic findings are cardiac malformations (in paicular, septal defects), eye defects (cataracts, microphthalmia, and retinopathy), microcephaly, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and growth restriction. Deafness and mental retardation are expected after bih. Test for rubella specific antibody (IgM) should be done within 10 days of the exposure to know whether patient is immune or not. Associated anomalies: Occasionally the following anomalies can be associated with the classic findings of fetal rubella syndrome: renal disorders, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, meningocele, glaucoma, patent ductus aeriosus, and peripheral pulmonary stenosis. Differential diagnosis: All the conditions that can be associated with congenital hepatomegaly and/or cataract should be excluded. It includes congenital infections (TORCHS), fetal anemia, fetal liver tumor, chondrodysplasia punctata, Neu. Laxova syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, and Walker-Warburg syndrome. Prognosis: Intrauterine death may occur. Postnatal impact of the intrauterine infection varies from absence of any defect to all the anomalies mentioned above with variable severity. The agent may remain for years in the tissues, causing chronic infection and its complications (such as diabetes mellitus due to chronic viropathy of the pancreas). Management: Termination of pregnancy should be considered every time fetal infection is detected during the first trimester, due to the severity of the condition in this group. After bility, monthly sonographic monitoring for growth and follow-up of the anomalies is recommended. Prevention: Women found to be susceptible during pregnancy should be offered vaccination postpaum and before discharge from the hospital (vaccine is not recommended in pregnancy).

Techniques of Repair - Layer technique Latzko procedure (for fistulas following hysterectomy) Chassar Moir technique. Post-operative Management - Continuous bladder drainage for 14 days. Antibiotic coverage. No vaginal examination, P/S, intercourse x 3 months. Avoid pregnancy for 2 years. In pregnancy after repair of vaginal fistula - elective cesarean is done. Extra Edge: This question is an old one so here answer will be 3 months but if this question is repeated now remember the following lines from Williams Gynae. 1st /ed 575-576: \"Timing of repair: Traditional teaching recommends delayed repair of fistulas at 3 - 6 months after injury. However, this old dictum is probably no longer applicable. Most agree that unless there is a severe infection or acute signs of inflammation, waiting is not necessary. Early surgical intervention of uncomplicated fistulas does not affect closure rates, yet appears to reduce social and psychological patient distress (Balivas, 1995). Fistulas identified within the first 24 - 48 hours postoperatively can be safely repaired immediately with success rates of 90 - 100%. \"",

Whereas glucose crosses the placenta, insulin does not, leading to increased fetal production of insulin to compensate for its hyperglycemic environment. Higher insulin levels promote increased fetal somatic growth, leading not only to macrosomia and central fat deposition but also to enlargement of internal organs such as the heart.

The baby has been moving normally and she has had no contractions or gush of fluid from the vagina.

        "exp": "Placenta pre is defined as a placenta located over the cervical os. There are 3 major types. Complete pre describes a placenta that completely covers the cervical os. Paial pre is a placenta that covers some of the cervical os, with the remainder of the os uncovered by the placenta. Marginal pre describes a placenta that is located at the edge of the cervical os. Three major risk factors for placenta pre are maternal age, minority race, and previous cesarean delivery. Placenta accreta describes the condition in which there is abnormal attachment of the placenta to the uterine wall. In this condition, the decidua basalis is absent and the placenta is attached to the myometrium(accreta) or invades into the myometrium (increta) or perforates through the myometrium (percreta). Many patients with a pre and accreta will require a hysterectomy at the time of delivery. This patient, with a history of 2 prior cesarean deliveries and a placenta pre is at highest risk for placenta accreta.

The most impoant reason that pregnancy uncovers the diabetic tendencies of asymptomatic women is the progressive increase in insulin resistance that occurs during gestation. Other reasons for the diabetogenic tendency of pregnancy are increased lipolysis and the alterations in gluconeogenesis that normally occur. During pregnancy a given dose of insulin has a greater hypoglycemic effect when administered in the first trimester than in the last. The insulin resistance occurs mainly because of the antagonistic effect of placental human chnriottic sonzatornammotropin. Insulin destruction by the kidney and placental insulinases as well as the antiinsulin effect of other hormones(coisol, estriol, progesterone) produced in large amounts during pregnancy also contributes to insulin resistance. Periconceptional counselling of the diabetic patient:? Inadequate blood sugar control often results in higher incidence of first trimester aboion, fetal congenital abnormalities, fetal macrosomia, polyhydramnios, and still bihs. But if the blood sugar is strictly controlled before conception and during the pregnancy the frequency of these abnormal outcomes approaches that of non diabetic population. It is impoant to emphasize that the time of highest risk of fetal malformations is during the periconceptional period and the period of organogenesis and that the risk can be greatly reduced by adequate glycemic control before pregnancy and during early pregnancy. Screening for diabetes during pregnancy:? The best screening test for gestational diabetes is the measurement of plasma glucose 1 hour after ingesting 50 g of glucose. The results are interpreted as:- Plasma glucose > 140 mg/c11 ---> the patient may have gestational diabetes and requires fuher testing Plasma glucose < 140 mg/d1 --> patient is not at risk Patients with abnormal screening test should be given a 3 hour glucose tolerance test.

These disorders are generally among the most easily diagnosed and most treatable causes of infeility. \" In couples with infeility ovulatory disorder have the best prognosis. Relatively poor prognosis is observed in male factor infeility and tuba! factor infeility. Prognosis can be arranged as below in descending order on the basis of cumulative pregnancy. Ovulatory factor > unexplained > Male factors > Endometriosis > Tubal factors. Treatment of anovulation is determined by the diagnosis: An elevated FSH along with chronic anovulation indicates ovarian resistance or failure: treatment is steroids / in vitro feilisation in such cases. If chronic anovulation is present along with normal FSH and prolactin: then induction of ovulation can be achieved in 90% of cases. - A treatment plan is done using clomiphene as the first drug: 1. Colmiphene citrate: it is the agent of choice for women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea having sufficient ovarian function to maintain estrogen at a serum level of 40pg/ml. Patient selection Normal gonadotropicdeg: normoprolactinemicdeg patients with normal cycle but absent or infrequent ovulation. deg PCOSdeg Post pill amenorrhea. deg Dose Initial dose of 25 to 50mgdeg is given daily from 02 - D 5. Ovulation is expected to occur about 5 - 7 days after the last day of therapy. If ovulation doesnot occur, dose is increased in 50mg steps to a maximum of 250mg daily. Therapy is in given for 4-6 cycles. Clomiphene will be successful in inducing ovulation in about 70% of women, with ovaries producing estrogen. Switch over from clomiphene to more aggressive therapy is done when: There is no response to clomiphenedeg There is ovulatory response to clomiphene but no pregnancy. deg Patients with pituitary insufficiency. deg These patients usually respond to Gonadotropins. 2. Gonadotropin therapy: Prerequisite for Gonadotropin therapy: Ovarian reserve must be present. The Gonadotropins used are: Human menopausal Gonodotropin: - It is a formulation containing equal amounts of FSH and LH (751U each). - It is prepared from hormones obtained from urine of postmenopausal women. - HCG is required as an ovulatory trigger. - FSH: purified urinary FSH and Recombinant FSH are also available. 3. Gonadotropin releasing hormone: Pulsatile Gn. RH If other methods have failed then pulsatile Gn. RH is needed in patients with anovulation and hypothalamic insufficiency Other drugs which can be used to for ovulation: 1. Bromocriptine/Cabergoline: Are used to to treat anovulation caused by increase in serum prolactin level. 2. Coicosteroids: Use to treat anovulation due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Tamoxifen: It is an antiestrogen. It is an alternative to clomiphene and is used for the same type of cases. Metformin and letrozole: Used to treat infeility due to hyper insulinemia and insulin resistance.",

Immunoassay - An Immunoassay is a test that uses antibodies detected against the hormone to \"capture\" the hormone. The test uses materials or substances that are related to or are a part of the immune system. To perform an immunoassay, cells are introduced from the immune system which may or may not have an antibody and cell clumping is observed. Radioimmunoassay - An radioimmunoassay uses a radioisotope as the label to detect and measure the amount of hormone present in the sample. Bioassay for detecting h. CG was developed in 1930's. wherein samples were injected in rabbits, frogs etc and ovulation was observed. These tests were expensive, slow and insensitive for h. CG as they couldnot differentiate between LH and h. CG. Bioassay for h. CG is an outdated test these days. ELISA - It consists of immunosorbent assay of monocional antibodies to detect B-h. CG. It forms the bases of home pregnancy tests. This is more sensitive and specific and can detect h. CG in serum upto 1-2 m. IU/ml. Radioimmunoassay and Radio receptor assay are more sensitive than ELISA and detect h. CG Gupto. 002 m. LU/ml in serum (RIA) or. 05 m. LU/ml (IRMA) But between the two, Radioimmunoassay is more specific as it doesnot cross react with luteinizing hormone and is the best test for detecting B-h.

More than one of these can cause postpaum hemorrhage in any given patient. Uterine atony - \"Tone\": Atony is by far the most common cause of postpaum hemorrhage. Uterine contraction is essential for appropriate hemostasis, and disruption of this process can lead to significant bleeding. Uterine atony is the typical cause of postpaum hemorrhage that occurs in the first 4 hours after delivery. Risk factors for atony include the following: Overdistended uterus (e. g., multiple gestation, fetal macrosomia, polyhydramnios) Fatigued uterus (e. g., augmented or prolonged labor, amnionitis, use of uterine tocolytics such as magnesium or calcium channel blockers) Obstructed uterus (e. g., retained placenta or fetal pas, placenta accreta, or an overly distended bladder) Trauma to the genital tract accounts for 20% of cases",

The most common causes of tachypnea in the newborn is transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). TTN results when fetal lung fluid production fails to cease with the onset of labor. The incidence of TTN is significantly increased when the baby is delivered caesarean section without labor especially if performed before 39 weeks of gestation. The newborn presents with tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and cyanosis. CXR reveals interstitial and alveolar edema; fluid is characteristically seen in the right middle lobe fissure.

Patients present with depression, anxiety, fearfulness, insomnia, helplessness and negative feelings towards infant. It may last from a few days to 2-3 weeks. Generally self limited, 20% of women may develop depression in the first postpaum year. Treatment: Reassurance and psychological suppo of family members. Post-oaum depression: It is observed in 10 - 20% of mothers. It is more gradual in onset over the first 4 - 6 months following delivery or aboion. Changes in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis may be a cause. Manifested by loss of energy and appetite, insomnia, social withdrawal, irritability and even suicidal attitude. Risk of recurrence 50 - 100% in subsequent pregnancies. Treatmeni Should be staed early. Fluoxetine or paroxetine is effective and has fewer side effects. According to kaplan, the cause of post paum blues is: \"ine sudden decrease in estrogen and progesterone immediately after delivery may also contribute to the disorder, but treatment with these hormones are not effective. \"",

Spinbarkeit is basically a test for assessing ovulation: At the time of ovulation, the cervical mucus is thin and so profuse that the patient may notice a clear discharge, (called Normal ovulatory cascade). This ovulatory mucus has the propey of great elasticity and will withstand stretching up to a distance of over 10 cm. This phenomenon is called SPINBARKEIT, or thread test for oestrogen activity. Under the influence of progesterone after ovulation mucus becomes thick and opaque and breaks on stretching i. e. hostile for sperms Therefore, indirectly Spinbarkeit test can also detect cervical hostility.",

Imperforate Hymen: It is the most common cause of cryptomenorrhea. Patients (young girls) present at pubey with Primary Amenorrhea (actually cryptomenorrhea) having not attained menarche. Secondary sexual characteristics are normal. Pathology: In such patients there is cyclical shedding of endometrium and blood, (so, patients give H/0 cyclical pain), which keeps accumulating in the uterine cavity resulting in hematometra. In neglected cases it may lead to distension of tubes Le. hematosalpinx. Patient may present with colicky pain in abdomen, pelvic discomfo or rectal pain. Hematocolpos can cause pressure symptoms like difficulty during micturition which finally ends up with urinary retention. On examination: A tumor, dull on percussion is found in lower abdomen (This could paly be due to distended vagina and uterus and paly by an overfill bladder with hyperophied wall). On separation of labia, bluish bulging membrane is present. Management: Once the diagnosis is made surgical treatment is urgently required, as every menstrual episode fuher dilates the genital tract and threatens permanent impairment of reproductive function.

The point at which they meet is known as squamo-columnar junction. This squamo-columnar junction is at the level of external os. deg Under the influence of hormones the sub columnar cells transform into squamous cells. This changing of one type of epithelium into the other is called as Metaplasia. Metaplastic cells are: Normal cells. deg No Nuclear atypia. deg Do not transform into malignant cells. deg Squamous metaplasia is a normal process and occurs most actively immediately adjacent to the original SCJ, creating a zone of metaplastic epithelium termed as Transformation zone between the original SCJ and columnar epithelium. ii. Dysplasia: Represents a change in which there is alteration in cell morphology and disorderly arrangement of the cells of the stratified squamous epithelium. It is a premalignant lesion. Characteristics of Dysplastic cell: Vary in sizedeg, shapedeg and polaritydeg. Have altered nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio (N/C ratio is increased). deg Have large, irregular hyperchromatic nuclei with marginal condensation of chromatin material. deg Have several mitotic figures.

As far as Choroid plexus cyst is Concerned: \"Several investigators have suggested that choroids plexus cysts are also associated with an increased risk of trisomy 21. However, our group demonstrated that the frequency of choroids plexus cysts among fetuses with trisomy 21 was the same as that among fetuses without trisomy 21, suggesting that the presence of choroid plexus cysts should not increase a patient's calculated risk of having a fetus with Down syndrome. This is in agreement with the work from Gupta and co-workers, who repoed a 1 in 880 risk of Down syndrome among fetuses with isolated choroid plexus cysts detected antenatally. \" \"The presence of a cyst in the choroid plexus in an axial view through the upper poion of fetal head has been correlated with the increased risk of Trisomy 18. \" Choroid plexus cysts are found to be associated with trisomy 18 (occurring in nearly 30% of cases of trisomy 18).

Damage to the cilia or blockage of the Fallopian tubes is likely to lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) increases the occurrence of ectopic pregnancy by 6-10 fold. This results from the build-up of scar tissue in the Fallopian tubes, causing damage to cilia. If however both tubes were occluded by PID, pregnancy would not occur and this would be protective against ectopic pregnancy. IUD increases the likelihood of tubal pregnancy by 7 times, should the pregnancy occurs with IUD in situ. Progestin only pill/postcoital estrogen preparations increases the risk due to impaired tubal motility. Tubal ligation can predispose to ectopic pregnancy. Reversal of tubal sterilization (Tubal reversal) carries a risk for ectopic pregnancy. A history of ectopic pregnancy increases the risk of future occurrences to about 10%. Ectopic pregnancy occasionally occurs in women who have had a hysterectomy. Women exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero (aka \"DES Daughters\") also have an elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy, up to 3 times the risk of unexposed women.",

As we know endometrial biopsy for infeility is taken on D 21-23 with the aim to rule out anovulation. Normally on these days endometrial biopsy should show secretory changes (as ovulation occurs on D-14 and subsequent there is increase in progesterone levels in body) But in case of anovulation endometrial biopsy does not show secretory changes but show proliferative changes.

        "question": "A 26 year old female presents with a chief complaint of menstrual bleeding 10 days prior to the usual onset of menses. She states that her last menstrual period was heavier than usual. The physician examines her and performs a pregnancy test (which is negative) then concludes that she is probably experiencing dysfunctional bleeding due to anovulation. If an endometrial biopsy were performed, which of the following would be the most likely histologic appearance of this type of endometrium?",
        "exp": "The most common cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is anovulation. This is caused by excessive and prolonged estrogen effect without the postovulatory progesterone effect. This occurs most often around menarche and menopause, when subtle hormonal imbalances commonly occur. An estrogenic stimulation causes the endometrial glands to proliferate. Persistent proliferation without a progesterone phase will eventually break down and bleed even though there is no secretory change present and the stroma is not menstrual. That is why this is called \"anovulation bleed, \" because it is a non-ovulatory bleed that may seem like normal menstruation. Asynchronous secretory endometrium refers to secretory endometrium that has a mismatch of 2 or more days between the glands and the stroma. For example, the glands may be at day 17 while the stroma shows more maturity, corresponding to day 22. This is a type of dysfunctional ovulatory bleeding and clinically presents with infeility. It is usually due to an inadequate luteal phase because the corpus luteum is not producing enough progesterone even though ovulation has occurred. Decidualized stroma with inactive glands is the common histologic appearance of patients taking oral contraceptives. These patients have asynchronous glands and stroma. The glands are usually not active and the stroma appears to be ready for implantation. This reves to normal with discontinuation of oral contraceptives. Early proliferative endometrium and late secretory endometrium (choice D) are physiologic phases of the normal menstrual cycle. Ref: Hoffman B. L., Schorge J. O., Schaffer J. I., Halvorson L.

        "exp": "Ans. is b i. e. High grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia There are various nomenclatures / classification systems for repoing of Pap smear. The one which is classically used is by WHO, which uses the terms CIN-I, CIN-II and CIN-III (as discussed in chapter on CIN). Another system is devised Bethesda. It classifies cytological abnormalities of premalignant leisons into three categories: Atypical squmous cells of undetermined signifcance (ASCUS). Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance: The most common cytologic abnormality is atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). which indicates cells that are suggestive of, but do not fulfill the criteria for, SIL. The risk of progression to CIN-II or CIN-III approximates only 5% and cancer is found in only 1 to 2 per thousands instances. The evaluation of ASC-US should not be overly aggressive, paicularly in adolescents who are at low risk of cervical cancer. (American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2006a: Moscicki, 2005). There are three options for evaluation of ASC-US - HPV DNA testing. Colposcopy. or Repeat cytologies at 6 and 12 months, with referral to colposcopy if either of these is abnormal. Low-Grade Squamous Intraepiethelial Lesion: This cytology result indicates the likely presence of HPV infection or low-grade neoplasia. Low-grade SIL encompasses the cytologic features of HPV infection and CIN-I and carries a 15 to 30 percent risk of progression to CIN-II or CIN-Ill. Therefore, colposocpy is indicated for most. High-Grade Squamous Intraepiethelial Lesion and Glandular Abnormalities: High grade SIL, should all be evaluated by prompt colposcopic evaluation. High-grade SIL cytology encompasses features of CIN-II and CIN-III and carries a high risk of underlying histologic CIN-II or CIN-Ill (at least 70%). or invasive cancer (1 to 2%). Alternative management of HSIL cytology in women age 21 years and older includes immediate diagnostic loop excision because colposcopy may miss a high-grade lesion and most HSIL cytologies evenatually result in excision for diagnosis or treatment.",
