The mesosalpinx covers the uterine tube and hangs below it to meet with the mesovarium. The mesovarium covers the ovary and ovarian ligament. It extends posteriorly from the mesosalpinx like a shelf. The mesometrium makes up the rest of the broad ligament. The ovarian ligament is located in the broad ligament but is not pa of the broad ligament. It is a round cord that attaches the ovary to the uterus just below the point where the uterine tube enters the uterus. The round ligament of the uterus reaches the lateral surface of the uterus below the uterine tube. It is continuous with the ovarian ligament and it holds the fundus of the uterus forward. The suspensory ligaments of the ovary are peritoneal folds that cover the ovarian neurovascular supply as these vessels pass over the pelvic brim to reach the ovary. Ref: Hoffman B. L., Schorge J.

An airfree space should be left by squeezing the tip and holding it up, till it is unrolled fully for better collection of semen. It should be used only once. It should not be inflated for testing. Vaseline oils, skin lotions, cold creams, should not be used as they increase the chance of rupture. If lubrication is needed, glycerine, K-Y jelly or spermicidal jelly can be used. Soon after discharge, the male should withdraw the penis holding the condom firmly against his body To increase the effectiveness, a dose of spermicidal jelly or foam tablet may be used at the same time. In case of breakage, slippage, or defective use, women should report or use emergency contraceptive within 72 hours and a spermicidal agent should be quicldy inserted into the vagina. Advantages of condom Condoms gives very good protection against STDs. These includes syphilis gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, moniliasis, nongonococcal urethritis, and infection with Chlamydia and Herpes virus. They are the only contraceptives to protect against HIV and against sexually transmitted hepatitis B Virus. Condoms reduce the chances of developing cervical dysplasia and cancer cervix (by preventing HPV infection) Disadvantages It can lead to contact dermatitis in female partners. Failure rate 12%",

In response, adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH) levels are increased to normalize coisol production. Adrenal hyperplasia and elevated androgens results as a consequence of this accommodation. Thus, symptoms of late-onset CAH reflect accumulation of precursor C19 steroid hormones. These precursors are conveed to dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone.

Estrogen mainly estradiol (the most potent estrogen), stimulates cervical mucus production and as its levels rise during the follicular phase mucus become more abundant, watery and less cellular. Progesterone inhibits cervical mucus production and makes it opaque, viscid and impenetrable. Cervical mucus: It is composed of 92-98% water, and 1% inorganic salts mainly sodium chloride. It also contains simple sugars, polysaccharides, proteins and glycoproteins. Its pH is usually alkaline ranging from 6. 5 to 9. 0. Ferning is a method used to estimate hormone levels. Ferning refers to the characteristic microscopic pattern that results from the crystallization of the inorganic salts in the cervical mucus when it is dried. As the level of estrogen increases, dried mucus begin to demonstrate ferning in the later pa of follicular phase. Absence of ferning indicates inadequate estrogen stimulation of endocervical glands or inhibition of endocervical glands by increased secretion of progesterone.

Recurrence risk can be reduced with the use of folic acid. Anencephaly isone of the most frequent congenital malformation of the brain. In this condition large poions of scalp, cranial bones, brain including both cerebral coex and white matter are missing. Only hemmorhhagic nubbin of nerves, glial and connective tissue remains. Brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord are present but they are malformed. Most common causes are chromosomal anomalies, maternal hypehermia, deficiencies of folate, zinc and copper. This condition can be detetced by elevated maternal serum levels of alpha feto protein and acetyl cholinesterase.

Nearly one third of them will progress to cancer and one fouh may already have associated undiagnosed cancer. In women approaching or past menopause, hysterectomy is a safer choice in those with complex or atypical hyperplasia So Remember: Best management of atypical hyperplasia is hysterectomy. Also Know Management of Endometrial Hyperplasia? - Depends on the patient's age and the presence or absence of cytological atypical. Non atypical hyperplasia: Premenopausal women: Progesterone therapy- options - Medroxyprogesterone acetate for 21 days a month daily for 3 months. - Progesterone containing IUCD. Post menopausal women Simple hyperplasia without atypia - Generally followed without therapy. Complex hyperplasia without atypia - Cyclical / continous progesterone therapy. These patients should be followed annually by endometrial biopsy. Atypical hyperplasia: Post menopasual and premenopausal women not willing to preserve feility- Hysterectomy. Premenopausal women willing to preserve feility - High dose progesterone therapy. Resolution of the hyperplasia must be confirmed by serial endometrial biopsy every 3 months until response is documented, otherwise hysterectomy should be done.",

Patients may complain of urinary incontinence or an increase in vaginal discharge following pelvic surgery or pelvic radiotherapy with or without antecedent surgery. The drainage may be continuous; however, in the presence of a very small vesicovaginal fistula, it may be intermittent. Recurrent cystitis or pyelonephritis, abnormal urinary stream, and hematuria also should initiate a workup for vesicovaginal fistula. The time from initial insult to clinical presentation depends on the etiology of the vesicovaginal fistula. A vesicovaginal fistula secondary to a bladder laceration typically presents immediately. Approximately 90% of genitourinary fistulas associated with pelvic surgery are symptomatic within 7-30 days postoperatively. An a: lterior vaginal wall laceration associated with obstetric fistulas typically (75%) presents in the first 24 hours of delivery. In contrast, radiation-induced UGFs are associated with slowly progressive devascularization necrosis and may present 30 days to 30 years later.

In familial cases of ovarian cancer, the cancers tend to appear at a younger age, but are thought to possibly have, on an average, a slightly better prognosis than do isolated cases. Families with multiple cases of breast cancer due to genetic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 also have an increased incidence of ovarian cancers. The BRCA1 mutation is paicularly virulent, and up to 30-40% of women with this mutation develop ovarian cancer. (There are also families in which the women have a BRCA1 mutation and develop ovarian, but not breast cancer at an increased rate). Another cancer syndrome, the Lynch II syndrome (also known as the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome), is also associated with ovarian cancer (and cancers of the uterus, breast, stomach, and pancreas). In both the breast cancer families and the Lynch II families, the genetic pattern seen is usually autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Prophylactic oophorectomy is often offered women in cancer families who have reached the age of 35 and have had their children.

        "question": "Test for ovarian reserve",
        "exp": "FSH Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce egg. The ovary is generally thought of as an egg bank from which the woman draws during the reproductive life. During the. flrst few days of each monthly cycle, under the influence of FSH and LH there is rapid growth of several follicles in the ovary. After a week or more of growth one of the follicles begin to outgrow. All the others and the remaining follicles involute (a process called atresia), and these follicles are said to become atretic. The process of atresia is impoant because it normally allows only one of the follicles to grow large enough, each month, to ovulate. This usually prevents more than one child from developing with each pregnancy. The single follicle reaches a diameter of 1-1. 5 centimeters at the time of ovulation and is called the mature follicle. With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce eggs declines. Methods of assessing ovarian reserve: With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce egg declines i. e. ovarian reserve decrease with age. - Usually age is the best predictor of ovarian reserve but approximately 10% of women have an accelarated loss of ovarian reserve by their mid-30's. - So age alone does not tell the whole story. Consequently more refined methods. for predicting ovarian reserve have been developed. The methods for assessing ovarian reserve are classified into two groups:- a). Passive testing b). Dynamic testing The goal of both the approaches is to provide information regarding oocyte (egg) quality and quantity. Passive testing FSH level Early follicular phase FSH levels play an impoant role in pregnancy outcomes. As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this adaptive response remains unknown. A rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompained by a decline in oocyte quality. High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy. Generally FSH level are expected to be below 10 lu/mlin women withreproductive potential - In one study it was. found out that 3 day FSH of less than 15 mlu/ml were twice as likely to conceive than women with FSH values between 15 and 24. 9 mlu/ml. - Cycle day 3 is chosen because at this time the estrogen level is expected to be low, a critical feature as FSH levels are subject to a negative feedback. - Thus any determination of FSH needs to include corresponding estradiol level to indicate that the FSH level was drawn when estrogen level was low. Other methods for passive ovarian reserve testing Measurement of Inhibin B Inhibit B is an ovarian hormone that inhibits FSH release. Although present in ovulating women it is not normally. found in postmenopausal women. - Low inhibin levels suggests poor ovarian reserve. Transvaginal ultrasound Diminished ovarian reserve means that fewer follicles are available for stimulation and recruitment by _feility drugs. Transvaginal ultrasound allows the observation of ovaries and assess the number of follicles (ovarian volume). Dynamic ovarian reserve testing Clomiphene citrate challenge test? Clomiphene is an antiestrogen which inhibits the negative feedback of estrogen on hypothalamus i. e. the hypothalamus gets false signals that the patient does nor have enough estrogen. In response, the hypothalamus induces the pituitary gland to produce more FSH and LH. This is turn initiates follicular growth to produce estrogen. Clomiphene is able to exe this effect only when the estrogen level is low or the ovarian reserve is low. In a normal woman with adequate ovarian reserve there is enough inhibin and estrogen to suppress FSH production through negative feedback and resist the effects clomiphene. - When undergoing clomiphene citrate challenge test, the. first step is to measure day 3 FSH and estrogen. Then 100 ing of clomiphene is administered on cycles day 5 through 9 and FSH and estrogen measurements are repeated on cycle day 10. In general, a high day 10 FSH suggests poor ovarian reserve.",

Also know, In healthy women, an intravenous bolus of 10 units of oxytocin caused a transient but marked fall in aerial blood pressure that was followed by an abrupt increase in cardiac output. These hernodynamic changes could be dangerous to women already hypovolemic from hemorrhage or who had cardiac disease that limited cardiac output. The same danger is present for women with right to left cardiac shunts because the decrease in systemic resistance would fuher increase the shunt. So, - Oxytocin should not be given intravenously as a large bolus, but rather as a much more dilute solution by continuous intravenous infusion or as an intramuscular infection. Management of cardiac patient during pregnancy Antepaum Bed rest The most impoant measure for attenuating the impact of pregnancy on diseased heart is bed rest. Bed rest increases the venous return to the heart, improves renal perfusion, induces diuresis and promotes elimination of water. Dietory salt restriction It helps to prevent excess retention of sodium and water. Diuretics It should be given to cardiac pregnant patient if moderate restriction in sodium intake is insufficient to limit the normal intravascular volume expansion that occurs during gestation. Prophylactic digitalization It is commonly used in patients with severe heart disease who are not in ove congestive failure. During labour and delivery The pregnant cardiac patient should always labor and deliver in lateral supine position to avoid hemodynamic impairment caused by dorsal decubitus position. Effective pain relief during labour with morphine. Continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry. Restriction of i. v. fluids to 75 ml/hr (Almost all cardiac patients in labour should be kept on the dry side). Antibiotic prophylaxis (This is given in patients with congenital or acquired heart lesions). Thrombosis prophylaxis. Patient should be placed in sitting position after delivery.

        "exp": "Weheim's hysterectomy Because of the close anatomical association between ureter and Genital organs, ureteric injury is not uncommon during Gynaecological surgery. \"About 75% of Ureteral injuries result from Gynaecological operations and 75% of them occur following abdominal Gynaecological procedures. \" From the above lines it is clear that, k abdominal operations, ureters are more prone to injury than in vaginal operations (ruling out Options \"a\" and \"d-). Friends amongst the remaining two options Viz- Abdominal hysterectomy and Weheims Hysterectomy (also done by abdominal route). Logically speaking Weheim's Hysterectomy carries more risk of Ureter injury which means (not just cutting of Ureter but also includes ligation and devasculirization of ureters) because of 2 reasons: Weheim's is done in case of carcinomas and therefore lots of adhesions are present during surgery In Weheims - medial half of cardinal ligament is cut. Now if you remember the position of ureter. (See diag below). * Ureters are very prone to injury during cutting of medial half of cardinal ligaments. To suppo the above logic CGDT 10/e, p 779 says: \"The repoed incidence of ureteral injury during Gynaecologic procedures ranges from about 0. 5% in simple hysterectomies for benign disease upto 1. 6% for laparoscopic cases and to as high as 30% for some older series of Weheim's Radical Hysterectomies. \" Extra Edge: Impoant Anatomical locations where ureteric injury is common - At the level of infundibulo - pelvic ligaments. deg - Below the level of ischial spine. deg - At the level of internal cervical os - where uterine aery crosses the ureter fr. OM a. Oove. deg -Over the Anterior vaginal Fornix when ureter crosses it to enter the trigone of bladder. Urethra is prone to injury durinduring_*Anterior Colporrhaphydeg",

Enhanced by oestrogsn and inhibited by progesterone Estrogens: The main and most powerful estrogen produced by the ovary is oestradiola, followed by less active oestrone. Many metabolites of the estrogen are produced by liver, amongst which most impoant is oestriol. o Chief oestrogen in the reproductive year: Oestradiolo Main oestrogen in menopause: oestroneo Main oestrogen in pregnancy: oestriolo Estrogen receptors ER - a ER-ss Predominant sub-type in uterusdeg Predominant subtype in ovary, testis, prostate, brain, blood vessels, bone Main action of estrogen is on Secondary sexual characteristics Genital tract It determines feminine sensitivity and shyness Has main role in breast development Mainly uterus (see below) Progesterone: lt is secreted mainly by the corpus luteumo (i. e. secreted mainly after ovulation). The preovulatory rise in the progesterone is because luteinizing hormone initiates luteinization and progesterone production by the granulosa layer. Main action of progesterone is maintenance of pregnancyo and its action on uterus are inclined in this direction' Effect of estrogen and progesterone on uterus: Effect of estrogen Eflect of progesterone Estrogen causes marked proliferation of the endometrial stroma and greatly increased development of the endometrial glandso that will later be im. Planting ovum. Promote secretory changes in the ulreine endometrium during the later half of the monthly female sexual cycle, thus prepares the uterus for implanatation of the feilized ovum. Estrogen causes hyperophy of the myo metrium. o Progesterone causes marked swelling and secretory development of the endometrium Estrogen stimulates the synthesis of myometrial contractile protein actinomybin through a. AMP. l. Jnder the influence of estrogens the muscles beile more active and excitable and action potentials in the individual fibres become more frequent. o lt aids estrogen in myometrial hyperophy Glands increase in touosity and excess of secretory substance is accumulated in glandular epithelial cells. Lipid and glycogen deposits also increase' The estrogen dominated uterus is also more sensitive to oxytocin. In addition to the secretory effect on endometrium, prrysterone decreases the frequency and intensity of utrine contractions, thereby helping to prevent expulsion of the implanted ovum but increases the amplitude of contraction.",

There are two things to think about here First, you need to decide if a structure is pa of the uterus. If it is pa of the uterus, then you need to decide if it is shed during menstruation. The correct answer will be a structure that is pa of the uterus but is not shed during menstruation. Answers about structures that are not shed during menstruation because they are not pa of the uterine wall are incorrect. The myometrium is our correct answer. It is the middle muscular component of the uterine wall and it is not shed during menstruation. The endometrium is the inner mucosal coat of the uterus. It is shed during menstruation and exhibits many characteristic changes during the menstrual cycle. The mesometrium is the mesentary of the uterus which forms the major pa of the broad ligament of the uterus. It is not even pa of the internal lining of the uterus, so it's not the answer to look for. Cervical mucosa lines the cervix, which is the inferior poion of the uterus. This mucosa is shed during menstruation. Ref: Cunningham F. G., Leveno K. J., Bloom S. L., Hauth J. C., Rouse D. J., Spong C. Y. (2010). Chapter 6. Paurition. In F. G. Cunningham, K. J. Leveno, S. L.

Punch Biopsy A 55 year old lady presenting to OPD with Post menopausal bleeding with a 1 x 1 cm nodule on the anterior lip of cervix- obviously we suspect carcinoma cervix in this case.

Here in the case since leison is visible we can go for direct biopsy i. e., Punch biopsy. Also know: Details of Diagnostic modalities in Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and Carcinoma cervix: A. Pap smear: It is a screening procedure. The primary goal of cervical cytologic screening is to identify women in whom fuher evaluation by coloposcopy is required to detect the presence of true cancer precursor. A speculum is introduced in vagina without lubricant and material from cervix is collected using Ayre's spatula. Whole of squamo-columnar junction has to be scrapped i. e. rotate the spatula through 360deg (Ist slide) and another slide is made from posterior fornix which acts as control. For more details, about Pap smear, see Chapter no. 2 B. Schiller Test: Principle: * Normal mature squamous epithelium of cervix contains Glycogen, which combines with Lugol's iodine to produce a deep mahogany colour. Abnormal squamous / dysplastic epithelium does not stain and constitutes a positive schiller test. C. Colposcopy associated with biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of cervical precancer. Ideally all patients undergoing treatment for abnormal cervical smears should be colposcoped. The aim of colposcopy is to identify the extent of the lesion and eradicate it by destruction or excision. The whole of the transformation zone needs to be visualize, as this area is believed to be the site of neoplastic change. Indications: Abnormal Pap smear cytology To locate abnormal areasdeg To obtain directed biopsiesdeg Conservative therapy under colposcopy guidancedeg For follow up of cases treated conservativelydeg In case of a lesion grossly suggestive of invasive carcinoma, cone biopsy is not indicated as it predisposes the patient to serious pelvic infection and bleeding. The diagnosis of such lesion can be confirmed by colposcopic directed simple biopsy. Colposocopy is safe in pregnancy. D. Endocervical Curettage: Transformation zone also extends into the endocervical canal. By colposcopy upper 2/3 of endocervix is not visualised. Therefore evaluation of the non visualised pa of the endocervical canal should be done by Endocervical curettage. Endocervical curettage should be performed in every case. - In which colposcopy is unsatisfactory. - where the lesion is extending into the endocervical canal. - Where the colposcopic impression does not explain the cervical cytology findings. E. Cone E'iopsy is both a diagnostic and a therapeutic procedure. Indications (Diagnostic): When limits of the lesion cannot be visualised with colposcopy. deg The squamo-columnar junction is not seen at colposcopy. deg In Endocervical curettage-histological findings are positive for CIN II or CIN III. deg There is a lack of correlation between cytology biopsy and colposcopy results. deg Microinvasive carcinoma or Adenocarcinoma in situ on colposcopy or cytology results. deg Therapeutic - In case of CIN III",

Question 36 asks: Polymenorrhea in a 45 years old woman for 6 months - first line of management. Whereas question 37 asks: Polymenorrhea in a 45 years old woman for 6 months - best line of management. Another thing which I want to point out here is: Question is on \"Polymenorrhea' and not DUB (Which generally refers to anovulatory DUB). As far as first line of management is concerned definately I would investigate the patient to rule out endometrial cancer. In this process I would perform diagnostic D & C. \"In the later reproductive years, even more care must be given to exclude pathological cause because of the possibility of endometrial cancer. Aspiration, curettage or both should clearly establish anovulatory or dyssynchronous cycles as the cause before hormone therapy is staed. \" As far as medical therapy is concerned: In ovulatory cycles - combined oral pills for 3 cycles is given. But staing OCP's in a perimenopausal female without prior investigations is not recommended. Now comes the -tricky\" pa: Best line of management in such cases. As far as D & C is concerned: \"Therapeutic curettage is of no value in the treatment of polymenorrhea. \" So, now we are left with 2 options either medical management with OCP's or hysterectomy. The place of surgery in the treatment of excessive bleeding without an organic basis varies with the age of the patient; it should be a last reso in young girls but may be considered earlier in women above the age of 40 years. Neveheless, in the latter group it is good practice to exclude organic disease by ultrasound and endometrial aspiration, to try medical therapy and proceed to hysterectomy if the response is inadequate or not sustained. When the patient is above 40 years of age, and when the hemorrhage fails to respond to simpler measure, hysterectomy is indicated. It is the treatment of choice in all cases of persistent or recurrent postmenopausal bleeding for which there is no obvious cause. Therefore, hysterectomy is the last reso, first medical management is tried. Hysterectomy personally I feel is not the best treatment as it is a major surgery, has its own complications and high rate of morbidity. I will not advise hysterectomy to all patients who come to me with complain of polymenorrhea of 6 months duration. But it is a dicy question. You will have to decide for yourself.",

They must only be performed when the following conditions exist: There is no evidence of micro invasion or invasive cancer (on cytology, colposcopy or ECC). The lesion is located on the ectocervix (as determined by colposcopy and ECC). There is no involvement of the endocervix (as determined by colposcopy and ECC). Cytology and histology correspond with each other Modalities available in Ablative procedure: Cryotherapy It destroys the surface epithelium of the cervix by crystallizing the intra cellular water, resulting in eventual destruction of the cell. Major advantage is its ability to control exactly the depth and width of destruction by It is useful when: It is paicularly useful in: - Small lesions - Larger lesions that cryoprobe cannot cover - CIN Grade I & II - Irregular cervix with a Fish Mouth appearance. - When lesion is located in ectocervix - Extension of the disease to vagina or satellite lesions on Vagina Lesions with extensive glandular involvement Depth of destruction = 4-5 mm * Depth of destruction = 7mm Complications: - Discharge (M/C) * Complications: - Slight discharge Bleeding (Rare) - Pain - Cervical Stenosis (Rare) - Bleeding - Infection (Rare) drawback of Ablative procedures: it destroys the tissue and so no tissue specimen is available for additional histological evaluation. deg Excici'InI Procedures: They can be used LEEP (Loop electrosurgical excision Cold Knife Conization procedure) or LLETZ= (Large loop excision of transformation zone) It is both diagnostic as well as therapeutic.

Remember: In both ablative and excision methods patient should be followed with Pap smears every 3-4 months and by endocervical curettage (ECC), if endocervix is involved. As far as hysterectomy is concerned: \"Hysterectomy is unacceptable as primary therapy for C1. N1, 2 or 3. However it may be considered when treating recurrent high grade cervical disease if childbearing has been completed or when a repeat cervical exicison is strongly indicated but technically not feasible. \" But most of the other books say that: Large Loop excision of transformation zone has become the procedure of choice for management of CIN in many developed countries. But in developing countries where women are likely to default from follow up, hysterectomy is still the best option. According to Shaw 14/e, p 365? Hysterectomy is desirable in: * Older and parous women When a woman cannot comply with follow-up If uterus is associated with fibroids, DUB or prolapse. If micro invasion exists.

I think you will be able to recall them better during exams. Let's first see what are the basic requirements for a female to menstruate normally. An intact out flow tract which connects the uterine cavity with outside and a normally developed uterus with its endometrium lining. Proper quantity and sequence of steroid hormones i. e. Estrogen and Progesterone which inturn originate from ovary. The maturation of follicular apparatus is guided by Gonadotropins - FSH and LH (released by pituitary).

Apa from case history and physical examination, endocrine profile and semen analysis are essential to disclose the underlying cause. The testes have two distinct but related functions, both of which are under adenohypophyseal and hypothalamic control. The first one is the production and storage of ble spermatozoa, and the second one is the synthesis and secretion of androgenic hormones. Various factors that can induce sterility in men are: trauma, infections like mumps, environmental factors like excessive heat, medications, and drugs. Because of the failure of testes to descend into the scrotum, seminiferous tubules remain infantile in structure and due to greater temperature of the inguinal canal, they degenerate.

Women who are overweight - or underweight - tend to have a more difficult time conceiving. The same goes for men, but more about that later. '- http //www early-pregnancy-tests com/ weight-feility html 'Exercise can affect feility in several ways. Over-exercising is one of the bigger causes of infeility for women. If a woman exercises too much, she is at a risk of losing too much of her body fat. Body fat plays an essential role in the production of estrogen; without enough estrogen, a woman who over-exercises might not ovulate. The technical term for not ovulating is oligomenorrhea, and is a major cause of feility problems. Women who don't get enough exercise can impact their feility negatively as well. By not getting enough exercise, a woman runs the risk of becoming overweight or obese. An overweight or obese woman, because she has more fat cells, can actually have too much estrogen. This overproduction of estrogen can negatively impact ovulation and conception. In addition, being overweight puts you at risk for insulin resistance, which can ultimately keep you from ovulating. http://wwwbabyhopes. com/aicles/exercise-feility. html",

A large-caliber catheter minimizes the potential for catheter blockage by blood clots, mucus, and calcaneus deposits. - Type and duration of catheter drainage: For fistulas involving the lower poion of the bladder trigone, bladder neck, or urethra, transurethral bladder catheters should not be used. A large suprapubic catheter is preferable to minimize excess tension on the suture line and to ensure nonobstructed continuous drainage. In posthysterectomy VVF repairs, both transurethral and suprapubic catheters may be placed. Surgeries to repair pelvic radiotherapy-associated VVFs require longer periods of drainage. Acidification of urine to diminish risks of cystitis, mucus production, and formation of bladder calculi is a consideration for patients with an indwelling catheter. Vitamin C or methenamine mandelate can be used. Estrogen replacement therapy in the postmenopausal patient may assist with optimizing tissue vascularization and healing. Control of postoperative bladder spasms: Urised iseffective for control of postoperative bladder spasms. It is a combination of antiseptics (methenamine, methylene blue, phenyl salicylate, and benzoic acid) and parasympatholytics (tropine sulfate, and hyoscyamine sulfate). Antibiotic therapy: Close follow-up and prompt evaluation for any urinary tract infections and antibiotic therapy, when indicated, are mandatory.

Fuhermore, deeply infiltrating endometriosis, that is disease that extends > 5 mm under the peritoneal surface, also appears to have positive correlation to the severity of dysmenorrhea. \" From above lines it is clear that pain in endometriosis coincides with the depth of lesion.

It is essential to destroy endometrial functionalis and basalis as well as 3mm of rnyometrial depth. Procedure: After appropriate inspection of the landmarks and endometrial cavity, a wire loop electrode is used to resect several strips of endornyometrium, to a depth of 4mm.

Appearance of vaginal bleeding are seen: The above triad may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fainting attacks or syncope. Patient may present in shock with pallor, tachycardia, hypotension and cold clammy extremities. Examination General examination: -- P/R T -- Pallor +nt -- BP. 1, -- Slight intermittent pyrexia due to absorption of products of degeneration. Per Abdomen - Abdomen is tense, tender and distended. -- Shifting dullness may be present (depending on the amount of hemorrhage). -- Rigidity / muscle guarding +/--, -- Cullen's sign - bluish discolouration around the umbilicus may be present. On Bimanual examination -- Vaginal mucosa appears blanched. deg -- Uterus: normal size / slightly bulky. -- Extreme tenderness on cervical movement -- Fornices - tender. (Remember - tenderness in pelvis is the most constant sign of Ectopic pregnancy). -- U/L adnexal mass: is palpable in one third to half of patient. Culdocesitt: si It is a simple technique used to identify hemoperitoneum. Fluid is aspirated from cul-de-sac posterior fornix with the help of a needle. If non clotting blood is obtained, it is indicative of an intraperitoneal bleed and probably a ruptured ectopic. Note: If the aspirated blood clots, it may have been obtained from an adjacent blood vessel rather than from bleeding ectopic pregnancy. The women in the question is presenting with amenorrhea of 6 weeks and pain in abdomen. On USG - fluid is seen in POD and aspiration of dark coloured blood which fails to clot - all these features leave no doubt of ectopic pregnancy. \"Sonographic absence of uterine pregnancy, a positive pregnancy test ($ -HCG), fluid in cul-de-sac and an abnormal pelvic mass. ectopic pregnancy is almost ceain. \"",

Friends, I know this is quite difficult to digest as we have been studying, Progesterone only pills act mainly by causing thickening of cervical mucus. But read the question once again: here question specifically mentions; ''newer progestational pills\". Read what FOGSI supplement has to say about mode of action of Progesterone only pills (also known as Estrogen Free Pills). Cervical Mucus effect: All Estrogen free pills except the newer desogesterel pill primarily rely on changes in cervical mucus as they do not inhibit ovulation consistently. The cervical mucus effect peaks within 3-4 hours after taking the tablet and lasts for about 22 hours. Hence the next tablet must be taken within 27 hours of the preceeding tablet or else the contraceptive benefit of the cervical mucus effect will decrease and finally subside. Inhibition of ovulation: Unlike COC's (Combined OCP's) that almost always prevent ovulation, traditional POP's (progesterone only pills) inhibit ovulation in 40-50% of cycles. A randomized double blind study, performed over 13 cycles showed that 75 micrograms desogestrel daily was sufficient to inhibit ovulation in 97% of cycles. Hence for newer POP's containing desogestre! the primary mode of action is inhibition of ovulation. Fogsi Focus Jan 06 issue on Modern pill, Chapter Estrogen free pill p 41. Thus, for newer progestational agents main mechanism of action is by inhibition of ovulation. Friends, I would like to discuss Progesterone only pills in detail here as Question can be asked on them anytime.

Dealing with missed pills: Progesterone only pill also called as Minipill, is best suited for lactating mothers and is therefore known as Lactational pill. deg If POP (Traditional) have been missed by more than 3 hours or Desogestrel containing by more than 12 hours, then one pill should be taken as soon as possible followed by the usual daily dose. deg Abstinence or use of additional contraception (barrier method) is advised for the next 48 hours. deg Side effects Menstrual disturbances: Most common reason for discontinuation of POP's is irregular bleeding pattern. Other side effects: Headache, Acne, Breast pain, Nausea, Vaginitis and Dysmenorrhea. Carbohydrate metabolism: At high doses, most progestogens adversely affect carbohydrate metabolism whether given alone or in conjunction with estrogen. Hence POP's should not be advised to women with H/O Gestational diabetes mellitus. Also know: Traditional POP's are also known as Low dose progestogen only pills. Main progesterone used are:- Norethisterone 35. Oug - Norgestrel 75mg - Levonorgesterel 30. Ags. Their main mechanism of action (as discussed earlier) is Thickening of cervical mucus. deg They also: - Render endometrium unsuitable for implantation - Accelerate tuba! motility - Disturb corpus luteal function.
