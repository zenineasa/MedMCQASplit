Classification of abortion: The clinical presentation of a threatened abortion describes any bleeding seen during pregnancy prior to viability, that has yet to be assessed further. At investigation it may be found that the fetus remains viable and the pregnancy continues without further problems. It has been suggested that bed rest improves the chances of the pregnancy continuing when a small subchorionic hematoma has been found on ultrasound scans. Alternatively, the following terms are used to describe pregnancies that do not continue: An empty sac is a condition where the gestational sac develops normally, while the embryonic part of the pregnancy is either absent or stops growing very early. Other terms for this condition are blighted ovum and anembryonic pregnancy. An inevitable abortion describes where the cervix has already dilated open, but the fetus has yet to be expelled. This usually will progress to a complete abortion. The fetal heartbeat may have been shown to have stopped, but this is not part of the criteria.",
