Precancerous lesions occur 10-15 years earlier (Figure 29. 8). Coitus before the age of 18 years. Multiple sexual partners. Delivery of the first baby before the age of 20 years. Multiparity with poor birth spacing between pregnancies. Poor personal hygiene. Poor socioeconomic status. At one time, exposure to smegma from uncircumcised partners was considered an important factor, accounting for lower incidence of cancer of the cervix amongst the Jews and Muslims. Now it is realized that the incidence of human papilloma virus is low in circumcised men, and that is the reason for low incidence of cancer in their wives. Smoking and drug abuse, including alcohol, are immunosuppressive (13 fold). Women with STD, HIV infection, herpes simplex virus 2 infection, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection (16, 18, 31, 33) or condylomata have a high predisposition to cancer. Of these, HPV is nowr considered the most important cause. Most HPV infection 16, 18 are symptomless in young women and clear within 2 years. Persistent infection is the cause of cancer of the cervix in 70-90% cases. Immunosuppressed individuals (following transplant surgery). Women with preinvasive lesions. Women w. Tho do not come for regular health check-up and Pap tests. COC and progestogens use over 8-year period can cause adenocarcinoma of the endocervix (double the risk). Five per cent women exposed to diethylstilboestrol in utero developed carcinoma of vagina and cervix. With withdraxval of this hormone its incidence has dropped.",
