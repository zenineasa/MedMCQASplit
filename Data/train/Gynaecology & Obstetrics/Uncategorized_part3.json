CG in the urine and serum, empty uterus, adnexal mass, decidual casts and free fluid in peritoneal cavity is pathognomonic of ectopic pregnancy. A trilaminar endometrial pattern is unique for diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy-its specificity is 94 percent, but with a sensitivity of only 38 percent. A decidual cyst is identified as an anechoic area lying within the endometrium but remote from the canal and often at the endometrial-myometrial border. This finding represents early decidual breakdown and precedes decidual cast formation. Also Know: All pregnancies induce an endometrial decidual reaction, and sloughing of the decidua can create an intracavitary fluid collection called a pseudogestational sac, or pseudosac. When a pseudosac is noted, the risk of ectopic pregnancy is increased. Ref: Cunningham F. G., Leveno K. J., Bloom S. L., Hauth J. C., Rouse D. J., Spong C. Y. (2010). Chapter 10. Ectopic Pregnancy.

        "question": "A 25 year old woman complains of abdominal pain of rapid onset in the right lower quadrant. She subsequently undergoes surgery for suspected acute appendicitis. At surgery, however, a tubal pregnancy is discovered. The most frequent predisposing factor for this condition is?",
        "exp": "The great majority of ectopic pregnancies (90%) occur in the fallopian tubes. The other sites are the ovaries, abdominal cavity, and the intrauterine segment of the fallopian tubes. Any condition that leads to anatomical abnormalities of the uterus and fallopian tubes may predispose to ectopic pregnancy. The most frequent of such conditions is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is usually associated with salpingitis. PID is a common infectious condition most frequently caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, both sexually transmitted. Other cases are due to a polymicrobial population, including staphylococci, streptococci, coliform bacteria, and Clostridium perfringens, acquired during aboion or delivery. PID leads to acute purulent salpingitis. If this is untreated or inadequately treated, it progresses to salpingo-oophoritis, tubal abscesses, pyosalpinx, or hydrosalpinx. Even milder cases may cause adhesions within the tube or between the tube and the ovary that interfere with implantation of the ovum and result in tubal pregnancy. All the remaining conditions listed above may also predispose to ectopic pregnancy. Endometriosis refers to the presence of endometrium in abnormal locations, such as the ovary, uterine ligaments, rectovaginal pouch, and pelvic peritoneum. It is an impoant clinical condition manifesting with pain, dysmenorrhea, and infeility. Scarring at endometriotic sites may cause peritubal adhesions and ectopic pregnancy. An intrauterine device may also increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy, but the mechanism of action is not clear. Leiomyomas of the uterus are the most frequent benign tumor in women. They develop from the smooth muscle as well-circumscribed nodules within the uterine wall (intramural), in a subserosal or submucosal location. Leiomyomas may cause significant distoion of the uterine wall and interfere with implantation, increasing the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Ref: Cunningham F. G., Leveno K. J., Bloom S. L., Hauth J.

HSG should not be performed during and immediately before menstruation and in the post ovulatory period. HSG should not be performed after curettage. In recently active salphingttis. In suspected Tuberculosis of Genital Tract. In infection of the lower Genital tract. Sonosalpingography is a method of assessing Tube Patency. It was popularized by G. Allahabadia and is also called as Sion test: Under USG guidance, a slow and deliberate injection of 200 ml of physiological saline into uterine cavity is accomplished a foley's catheter, the inflated bulb of which lies above the internal os and prevents leakage. It is possible to visualize the flow of saline along the tube and observe it is coming out as a shower at fimbrial end. USG shows the presence of free fluid in pouch of Douglas if tubes are patent.

Classification of prolapse Anterior vaginal wall: upper two thirds - cystocoele Cytourethrocoele lower one third - urethrocoele Posterior vaginal wall: upper one third - enterocoele (pouch of Douglas Hernia) Grade I = Descent halfway to the hymen Grade II = Descent to the hymen Grade IIt = Descent halfway past the hymen Grade IV = Maximum possible descent for site Bader walker Halfway system: 11, Grade 0 = Normal postion for each reproesentative site Uterine descent: Shaw's classification (old classification): 1deg- descent of the cervix to the vagina 2deg - descent of the cervix to the introitus 3deg - descent of the cervix outside the introitus. Procidentia: all of the uterus outside the introitus. Utero vaginal Prolapse: It is the commonest type of prolapse. Cystocoele occurs first followed by traction on the cervix causing retroversion of the uterus and then uterus is pushed into the vagina. Vault prolapse: it follows vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy, symptoms are-coital difficulty and difficulty in walking. Congenital Prolapse: There is no cystocoele. \"Data from Women's Health Initiative revealed anterior pelvic organ prolapse in 34. 3%, posterior wall prolapse in 18. 6% and uterine prolapse in 14. 3% of women in the study. \" Therefore, from the above data it is clear that cystocele (anterior organ prolapse) is the most common type of prolapse. Friends, according to latest trends, prolapse is not classified as above, but compamental classification is done. (It might be asked in fohcoming PGME exams). Newer classification Prolapse Uterine Prolapse Vaginal prolapse 10 descent of the uterus but the cervix remains within the introitus. 2o degree Descent to the extent that the cervix projects through the vulva, when the woman is straining or standing 3o degree i. e. complete Procidentia. Anterior compamentdefect. Leads to cystocoele. Urethrocele of vagina Middle compamentdefect. Leads to Enterocele& massive eversion Posterior compamentdefect. Rectocoele and Perinealbody descent Note: Sometimes the term apical prolapse is used - It includes: Uterine prolapse Vaginal vault prolapse (post hysterectomy) Enterocele",

        "exp": "Management of VVF is surgical management: The timing of surgery - Small urinary fistulas sometimes heal spontaneously during the first few weeks. However, in a case of established fistula - it is better to wait for about 3 months\u00b0 for all tissue inflammation to subside. If one attempt fails to heal fistula, the second attempt is done after 3 months.\u00b0 In fistulas following surgery, waiting period is 3-6 months. In fistulas following radiation: 6 months - 2 years time can be taken before inflammation subsides. Techniques of Repair - Layer technique Latzko procedure (for fistulas following hysterectomy) Chassar Moir technique. Post-operative Management - Continuous bladder drainage for 14 days. Antibiotic coverage. No vaginal examination, P/S, intercourse x 3 months. Avoid pregnancy for 2 years. In pregnancy after repair of vaginal fistula - elective cesarean is done. Extra Edge: This question is an old one so here answer will be 3 months but if this question is repeated now remember the following lines from Williams Gynae. 1st /ed 575-576: \"Timing of repair: Traditional teaching recommends delayed repair of fistulas at 3 - 6 months after injury. However, this old dictum is probably no longer applicable. Most agree that unless there is a severe infection or acute signs of inflammation, waiting is not necessary. Early surgical intervention of uncomplicated fistulas does not affect closure rates, yet appears to reduce social and psychological patient distress (Balivas, 1995). Fistulas identified within the first 24 - 48 hours postoperatively can be safely repaired immediately with success rates of 90 - 100%. \"",

This condition can develop as early as the second trimester but is maximal during the third trimester, 36 to 38 weeks. When the pregnant female in these stages lies in the supine position, the added weight of the enlarged uterus and its contents will press down on the inferior vena cava. When the IVC is compressed it reduces the amount of blood that returns to the heart and reduces cardiac output, this can result in a loss of 30% of the effective circulating blood volume. It can take 3-7 minutes for significant hypotension to manifest.",

These disorders are generally among the most easily diagnosed and most treatable causes of infeility. \" In couples with infeility ovulatory disorder have the best prognosis. Relatively poor prognosis is observed in male factor infeility and tuba! factor infeility. Prognosis can be arranged as below in descending order on the basis of cumulative pregnancy. Ovulatory factor > unexplained > Male factors > Endometriosis > Tubal factors. Treatment of anovulation is determined by the diagnosis: An elevated FSH along with chronic anovulation indicates ovarian resistance or failure: treatment is steroids / in vitro feilisation in such cases. If chronic anovulation is present along with normal FSH and prolactin: then induction of ovulation can be achieved in 90% of cases. - A treatment plan is done using clomiphene as the first drug: 1. Colmiphene citrate: it is the agent of choice for women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea having sufficient ovarian function to maintain estrogen at a serum level of 40pg/ml. Patient selection Normal gonadotropicdeg: normoprolactinemicdeg patients with normal cycle but absent or infrequent ovulation. deg PCOSdeg Post pill amenorrhea. deg Dose Initial dose of 25 to 50mgdeg is given daily from 02 - D 5. Ovulation is expected to occur about 5 - 7 days after the last day of therapy. If ovulation doesnot occur, dose is increased in 50mg steps to a maximum of 250mg daily. Therapy is in given for 4-6 cycles. Clomiphene will be successful in inducing ovulation in about 70% of women, with ovaries producing estrogen. Switch over from clomiphene to more aggressive therapy is done when: There is no response to clomiphenedeg There is ovulatory response to clomiphene but no pregnancy. deg Patients with pituitary insufficiency. deg These patients usually respond to Gonadotropins. 2. Gonadotropin therapy: Prerequisite for Gonadotropin therapy: Ovarian reserve must be present. The Gonadotropins used are: Human menopausal Gonodotropin: - It is a formulation containing equal amounts of FSH and LH (751U each). - It is prepared from hormones obtained from urine of postmenopausal women. - HCG is required as an ovulatory trigger. - FSH: purified urinary FSH and Recombinant FSH are also available. 3. Gonadotropin releasing hormone: Pulsatile Gn. RH If other methods have failed then pulsatile Gn. RH is needed in patients with anovulation and hypothalamic insufficiency Other drugs which can be used to for ovulation: 1. Bromocriptine/Cabergoline: Are used to to treat anovulation caused by increase in serum prolactin level. 2. Coicosteroids: Use to treat anovulation due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Tamoxifen: It is an antiestrogen. It is an alternative to clomiphene and is used for the same type of cases.

Immunoassay - An Immunoassay is a test that uses antibodies detected against the hormone to \"capture\" the hormone. The test uses materials or substances that are related to or are a part of the immune system. To perform an immunoassay, cells are introduced from the immune system which may or may not have an antibody and cell clumping is observed. Radioimmunoassay - An radioimmunoassay uses a radioisotope as the label to detect and measure the amount of hormone present in the sample. Bioassay for detecting h. CG was developed in 1930's. wherein samples were injected in rabbits, frogs etc and ovulation was observed. These tests were expensive, slow and insensitive for h. CG as they couldnot differentiate between LH and h. CG. Bioassay for h. CG is an outdated test these days. ELISA - It consists of immunosorbent assay of monocional antibodies to detect B-h. CG. It forms the bases of home pregnancy tests. This is more sensitive and specific and can detect h. CG in serum upto 1-2 m. IU/ml. Radioimmunoassay and Radio receptor assay are more sensitive than ELISA and detect h. CG Gupto. 002 m. LU/ml in serum (RIA) or. 05 m. LU/ml (IRMA) But between the two, Radioimmunoassay is more specific as it doesnot cross react with luteinizing hormone and is the best test for detecting B-h.

The incidence of TTN is significantly increased when the baby is delivered caesarean section without labor especially if performed before 39 weeks of gestation.

Imperforate hymen A young girl who has not attained menarche but has history of cyclical pain for last 6 months, presenting to casualty with acute abdomen and on examination a tense bulge in the region of hymen - clearly point towards \"Imperforate hymen\" as the diagnosis. Imperforate Hymen: It is the most common cause of cryptomenorrhea. Patients (young girls) present at pubey with Primary Amenorrhea (actually cryptomenorrhea) having not attained menarche. Secondary sexual characteristics are normal. Pathology: In such patients there is cyclical shedding of endometrium and blood, (so, patients give H/0 cyclical pain), which keeps accumulating in the uterine cavity resulting in hematometra. In neglected cases it may lead to distension of tubes Le. hematosalpinx. Patient may present with colicky pain in abdomen, pelvic discomfo or rectal pain. Hematocolpos can cause pressure symptoms like difficulty during micturition which finally ends up with urinary retention. On examination: A tumor, dull on percussion is found in lower abdomen (This could paly be due to distended vagina and uterus and paly by an overfill bladder with hyperophied wall). On separation of labia, bluish bulging membrane is present. Management: Once the diagnosis is made surgical treatment is urgently required, as every menstrual episode fuher dilates the genital tract and threatens permanent impairment of reproductive function.

Damage to the cilia or blockage of the Fallopian tubes is likely to lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) increases the occurrence of ectopic pregnancy by 6-10 fold. This results from the build-up of scar tissue in the Fallopian tubes, causing damage to cilia. If however both tubes were occluded by PID, pregnancy would not occur and this would be protective against ectopic pregnancy. IUD increases the likelihood of tubal pregnancy by 7 times, should the pregnancy occurs with IUD in situ. Progestin only pill/postcoital estrogen preparations increases the risk due to impaired tubal motility. Tubal ligation can predispose to ectopic pregnancy. Reversal of tubal sterilization (Tubal reversal) carries a risk for ectopic pregnancy. A history of ectopic pregnancy increases the risk of future occurrences to about 10%. Ectopic pregnancy occasionally occurs in women who have had a hysterectomy. Women exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero (aka \"DES Daughters\") also have an elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy, up to 3 times the risk of unexposed women.",

The physician examines her and performs a pregnancy test (which is negative) then concludes that she is probably experiencing dysfunctional bleeding due to anovulation. If an endometrial biopsy were performed, which of the following would be the most likely histologic appearance of this type of endometrium?",
        "exp": "The most common cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is anovulation. This is caused by excessive and prolonged estrogen effect without the postovulatory progesterone effect. This occurs most often around menarche and menopause, when subtle hormonal imbalances commonly occur. An estrogenic stimulation causes the endometrial glands to proliferate. Persistent proliferation without a progesterone phase will eventually break down and bleed even though there is no secretory change present and the stroma is not menstrual. That is why this is called \"anovulation bleed, \" because it is a non-ovulatory bleed that may seem like normal menstruation. Asynchronous secretory endometrium refers to secretory endometrium that has a mismatch of 2 or more days between the glands and the stroma. For example, the glands may be at day 17 while the stroma shows more maturity, corresponding to day 22. This is a type of dysfunctional ovulatory bleeding and clinically presents with infeility. It is usually due to an inadequate luteal phase because the corpus luteum is not producing enough progesterone even though ovulation has occurred. Decidualized stroma with inactive glands is the common histologic appearance of patients taking oral contraceptives. These patients have asynchronous glands and stroma. The glands are usually not active and the stroma appears to be ready for implantation. This reves to normal with discontinuation of oral contraceptives. Early proliferative endometrium and late secretory endometrium (choice D) are physiologic phases of the normal menstrual cycle. Ref: Hoffman B. L., Schorge J. O., Schaffer J. I., Halvorson L.

        "exp": "Ans. is b i. e. High grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia There are various nomenclatures / classification systems for repoing of Pap smear. The one which is classically used is by WHO, which uses the terms CIN-I, CIN-II and CIN-III (as discussed in chapter on CIN). Another system is devised Bethesda. It classifies cytological abnormalities of premalignant leisons into three categories: Atypical squmous cells of undetermined signifcance (ASCUS). Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance: The most common cytologic abnormality is atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). which indicates cells that are suggestive of, but do not fulfill the criteria for, SIL. The risk of progression to CIN-II or CIN-III approximates only 5% and cancer is found in only 1 to 2 per thousands instances. The evaluation of ASC-US should not be overly aggressive, paicularly in adolescents who are at low risk of cervical cancer. (American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2006a: Moscicki, 2005). There are three options for evaluation of ASC-US - HPV DNA testing. Colposcopy. or Repeat cytologies at 6 and 12 months, with referral to colposcopy if either of these is abnormal. Low-Grade Squamous Intraepiethelial Lesion: This cytology result indicates the likely presence of HPV infection or low-grade neoplasia. Low-grade SIL encompasses the cytologic features of HPV infection and CIN-I and carries a 15 to 30 percent risk of progression to CIN-II or CIN-Ill. Therefore, colposocpy is indicated for most. High-Grade Squamous Intraepiethelial Lesion and Glandular Abnormalities: High grade SIL, should all be evaluated by prompt colposcopic evaluation. High-grade SIL cytology encompasses features of CIN-II and CIN-III and carries a high risk of underlying histologic CIN-II or CIN-Ill (at least 70%). or invasive cancer (1 to 2%). Alternative management of HSIL cytology in women age 21 years and older includes immediate diagnostic loop excision because colposcopy may miss a high-grade lesion and most HSIL cytologies evenatually result in excision for diagnosis or treatment.",

The specimen should be reach the laboratory within an hour of ejaculation. Extra Edge: Besides WHO criteria for evaluating sperm morphology, another 'strict criteria' by Kruger and Tygerberg is gaining impoance. Strict sperm morphology represents the best current predictor of sperm function (the capacity to feilize a mature oocyte) and has emerged as the most discriminating factor among infeile and feile men. If > 14% sperms are of normal morphology by the strict criteria then only the semen considered as normal. Teratospermia is < 4% normal sperms by the strict criteria and is an indicator of poor prognosis in assisted feilization by ICSI in IVF cycles. When no motile sperms are observed a sperm bility test differentiates ble non motile sperms from dead sperms. Round cells in semen analysis includes epithelial cells. prostate cells. immature sperms (spermatogonia, round spermatids, spermatocytes) and leucocytes. If total round cells is > 5 million/ml it is abnormal. True leukocytospermia means > 1 million leukocytes/ml and requires semen culture for mycoplasma hominis, ureoplasma ureolyticum and Chlamydia.

Hysterectomy is occasionally performed for fibroid (benign tumor-like growths inside the uterus itself made up of muscle and connective tissue). Most hysterectomies are done laparotomy/ open technique/ open hysterectomy. The open technique carries increased risk of hemorrhage due to the large blood supply in the pelvic region, as well as an increased risk of infection. However, an open hysterectomy provides the most effective way to ensure complete removal of the reproductive system as well as providing a wide opening for visual inspection of the abdominal cavity. Complications: Hemorrhage Infection Constipation Urinary retention Blood clots -- Pelvic surgery increases the risk of developing blood clots in the large veins of the leg or lung.

        "exp": "Inversion of uterus?? 'c' i. e., Amniotic fluid embolism The patient went into unexplained shock after postpaum. Both uterine inversion and amniotic fluid embolism can cause unexplained shock. Uterine inversion is more common and impoant cause of unexplained shock than amniotic fluid embolism. Munrokerr's operative obstetrics says \"In all cases of unexplained shock after delivery make a careful vaginal examination to exclude the possibility of occult rupture of the uterus, paial uterine inversion or pelvic hematonza\". Munrokerr fuher adds Uterine inversion is the most impoant cause of unexplained shock Three degrees of inversion are generally described. i) Where the inveed. fundus reaches the internal os ii) Where the whole body of the uterus is inveed upto the internal os. iii) Where uterus, cervix and vagina are completely inveed Symptoms of uterine inversion Symptoms of uterine inversion are not always well defined. If however the inversion occurs quickly or is of severe degree there is. feelling of something coming down and pain followed by collapse and hemorrhage of variable severity. When the inversion is of lesser degree and is contained within the vagina or when the. fundus does not come beyond the os externum, only pain and hemorrhage may be present. Inversion is also the most impoant cause of unexplained shock - In these cases the shock is not primarily due to loss of blood or trauma but is really of neurogenic origin. - In this connection it has been suggested by several authors that as one or both ovaries may be pulled into the invagination, pressure on them may be responsible for shock. - The traction on the infundibulopelvic ligaments, peritoneum and broad ligaments stimulate the \"parasympathetic system\" producing shock. Amniotic fluid embolism may also cause unexplained shock -Amniotic fluid embolism is brought about by the uterine contractions forcing the liquor amni with its contained paicles of meconium, lanugo, and vernix caseosa into a patent uterine sinus from where it is carried into the lungs. - We have opted for uterine inversion as it is the more common cause for unexplained shock. Postpaum collapse from Ian Donald 6/e edited by Renu Mishra Postpaum maternal collapse is serious obstetric complication Majority of these cases occur as hemorrhage that is revealed. But a small minority of cases of collapse after deliver occur without obvious vaginal bleeding but these are the ones that pose a greater challenge. for diagnosis and management. The conzmon causes of postpaum collapse without bleeding are -Eclampsia - Uterine rupture - Vasovagal. syncope - Pulmonary embolism (Amniotic fluid embolism) - Septic shock - Uterine inversion Renu Mishra fuher adds - \"Acute inversion of the uterus should be one of the first possibilities to cross the obstetricians mind in case of unexplained shock\" Amniotic fluid embolism It is a life threatening complication of pregnancy with an extremely high moality rate. 300 The pathogenesis of the condition is not clear. Amniotic fluid probably enter the maternal venous circulation through a breach in the barrier b/w the maternal vasculature and the amniotic fluid most likely from the placental site or at the site of a uterine trauma after the membranes have ruptured. Classically amniotic fluid embolism presents during labour or immediately after the delivery with sudden onset maternal collapse associated with tachyapnea, cyanosis, hypotension, altered mental DIC. So, there is nothing to differentiate between uterine inversion and amniotic fluid embolism in terms of clinical presentation. We have opted for uterine inversion as it seems to be the more impoant and more common cause of unexplained shock. But we are still not sure - A patient with amniotic fluid embolism will always present in this manner i. e., unexplained death following normal de livery. - On the other hand uterine inversion commonly present as life threatening post paum hemorrhage. - It may present as unexplained shock but this is not its usual presentation. - If there is a case of postpaum collapse and no other significant findings are present the first diagnosis that comes to the mind is embolism. - All other causes of postpaum collapse will have some clinical. feature which would point towards to cause. Clinically most of the obstetricianl would suspect amniotic fluid embolism if any other abnormality is absent in case post paum collapse.",

The systolic component of blood flow reflects the cardiac pump and the diastolic component the distal vascular bed. In this case the distal vascular bed is the placental villous tree and hence umbilical artery Doppler is actually a placental and not a fetal Doppler. The umbilical artery is characterised by forward low resistance flow. As gestation increases, there is gradual fall in all the resistance indices so the amount of forward diastolic flow increases (Remember: Diastolic flow is inversely related to peripheral resistance). systolic/diastolic rates decreases as period of gestation increases.",

Inferior vena caval compression Symptoms of faintness and nausea in lying down position and recovery after turning on the side or getting up in a 26-year old primigravida at 32 weeks of gestation can be attributed to inferior vena caval compression. \"Supine hypotensive syndrome is caused when the inferior vena cava is compressed by the weight of a pregnant female uterus, fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid while lying in the supine position. The condition can develop as early as the second trimester but is maximum during the third trimester. The patient experiences reduced blood pressure signs of shock such as cool, moist and clammy skin, tachycardia (early sign), bradycardia (very late sign), dizziness, syncope or near syncope, pedal edema, nausea, decreased femoral pulse and signs offetal distress. Supine hypotensive syndrome is easily managed by placing the patient in left lateral position Supine Hypotension Syndrome (Postural Hypotension) During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava when the patient is in supine position. Q This, however, results in opening up of collateral circulation by means of paraveebral and azygous veins. In some cases (10%) when collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return to heart is seriously cuailed. Q This results in production of hypotension, tachycardia and syncope.

On Examination: Confirmatory tests: Methylene blue 3 swab test: (described earlier). Cystoscopy: To know exact location/size/number. Management: Surgical management: Timing of surgery Small urinary fistulas sometimes heal spontaneously during the first few weeks.

Techniques of Repair Latzko procedure Chassar Moir technique. deg Postop Management Continuous bladder drainage for 14 daysdeg. Antibiotic coverage. No vaginal examination, P/S, intercourse x 3 months. Avoid pregnancy for2 years. In pregnancy after repair of vaginal fistula - elective cesarean is done. deg Extra Edge: This question is an old one so here answer will be 3 months but if this question is repeated now remember the following lines from Williams Gynae. \"Timing of repair: Traditional teaching recommends delayed repair of fistulas at 3 to 6 months afte injury. However this old dictum is probably no longer applicable. Most agree that unless there is severe infection of acute sign od information, waiting is not necessary. Early surgical intervention of uncomplicated fistulas does identified within the first 24 to 48 hours postoperatively can be safely repaired immediately with success rates of 90 to 100 percent. \"",

But in these cases delivery of the fetus is followed by rapid normalization of the hepatic abnormalities. Moreover the question does not mention any history of PIH, hemolysis and thrombocytopenia (HELLP syndrome). Acute fatty liver of pregnancy: Acute fatty liver develops in the third trimester. Jaundice develops a few days after the onset. The serum bilirubin is rarely above 10 mg/dL. Alkaline phosphate is markedly elevated. Aminotransferases are moderately elevated. A markedly raised serum ammonia is the most diagnostic finding in establishing the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and symptoms rapidly abate with parturition in most patients. Fulminant hepatic failure: The patient presents with features of severe acute hepatitis leading to the development of hepatic encephalopathy within 8 weeks of onset. The bilirubin increases to 20-30 mg/dL. The aminotransferase levels are very high (>1000) Alkaline phosphatase moderately elevated. Delivery is usually the best treatment. Budd-Chiari syndrome: It is a disorder characterized by thrombotic occlusion of the hepatitis veins. It is a rare complication of pregnancy. Most of the cases presents within few weeks of delivery but in several cases onset occurs during pregnancy. Clinical triad of Budd-Chiari syndrome includes sudden onset of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and ascites (ascites with high protein content is almost always present) near term or shortly after delivery.

There is a little change in systolic blood pressure, but diastolic pressure is reduced (5-10mm Hg) from about 12-26 weeks. Diastolic pressure increases thereafter to prepregnancy levels by about 36 weeks. The obstruction posed by the uterus on the inferior vena cava and the pressure of fetal presenting pa on the common iliac vein can result in decreased blood return to the heart. This decreases cardiac output, leads to a fall in blood pressure, and causes edema in the lower extremities. Peripheral resistance equals blood pressure divided by cardiac output.

Serum Beta HCG monitoring The chances of persistent trophoblastic disease and choriocarcinoma are high after evacuation of H. mole therefore regular follow up is mandatory. \"After molar evacuation, patients should be monitored with weekly determinations of 0-subunit HCG levels until these levels are normal for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by monthly determinations until the levels are normal for 6 consecutive months. The average time to achieve the first normal HCG level after evacuation is about 9 weeks. At the completion of follow-up, pregnancy may be undeaken. After a patient achieves a nondetectable HCG level, the risk of developing tumour relapse is very low and may approach zero. \" Besides Serum Beta HCG at follow up following investigations are done: Pelvic examination -- To rule out any vulval and vaginal metastasis. -- To see the size of the uterus. -- To note the presence of any ovarian cysts and their sizes. It should be repeated every four weeks in the observation period. unest X-ray To detect lung metastasis Repeated at four weeks till spontaneous remission occurs and then at 3 months interval in the observation period. Pelvic Ultrasound: To detect any residual or locally invasive tumour and presence of ovarian cysts. Also Know: Patients are encouraged to use effective contraception during the entire interval of HCG follow up (i. e. atleast for 1 year). Choice of contraception: IUCD: should not be used because of the potential risk of uterine perforation and IUCDs cause irregular uterine bleeding which can be confused with persistent trophoblastic disease. Progestin pills: cause irregular bleeding therefore should not be used. OCP's: Earlier it was believed that OCP's should not be used till HCG values return to normal. But now it is said - \"OCP's may be used safely after molar evacuation during the entire interval of hormonal follow up\". \"Oral contraceptives are found to be superior to Barrier method or use of IUCD in decreasing the risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia\". Barrier method: Earlier they were the contraception of choice in case of GTDs. (Now it is combined pills).",

        "exp": "Ans. is a i. e. Transient tachypnea of the new born Friends don't get shocked by the answer, even I was perplexed when I went through the texts given in all the standard reference books. Let's see what they have said. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or hyaline membrane disease (HMD) RDS almost always occurs in nreterm babies often less than 34 weeks of gestation. It is the commonest cause of respiratory distress in a preterm neonate. According to Ghai -- RDS is seen in preterm babies and not the term babies (as is given in our question). Now let's see what Ghai says about transient tachypnea of newborn: Transient tachypnea of newborn (TTN) Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a benign self-limiting disease occurring usually in term neonates and is due to delayed clearance of lung fluid. These babies have tachypnea with minimal or no respiratory distress. Chest X-ray may show prominent vascular marking and prominent interlobar fissure. Oxygen treatment is often adequate and ventilatory suppo is necessary and prognosis is good. But Ghai didn't mention any correlation between TTN and Diabetes. So, I had to search other books for more information. Neonatal complications: RDS and transient tachypnea are more common in infants of women with poorly controlled diabetics. Respiratory distress: \"Conventional obstetrical teaching through the late 1980s generally held that fetal lung maturation was delayed in diabetic pregnancies. Thus, these infants were at increased risk for respiratory distress (Gluck and Kulovich, 1973). Subsequent observations have challenged this concept, and gestational age rather than ove diabetes is likely the most significant factor associated with neonatal respiratory distress (Berkowitz and colleagues, 1996; Kjos and colleagues. 1990b)\". So, it is the gestational age and not diabetes which is the main factor causing neonatal respiratory distress. In our question the baby is delivered at 40 weeks gestation (Full term) so, the answer can not be Hyaline membrane disease rather it is transient tachypnea of newborn (i. e. option 'a is correct).",

Candidiasis is a fungal infection common in women of childbearing age that results in pruritus, with a thick, white vaginal discharge. Patients often have a history of recurrent yeast infections or recent antibiotic treatment. Symptoms of candidiasis often begin just before menses. Precipitating factors include immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, and hormone replacement therapy. Candidiasis is usually not contracted from a sexual paner. Seventy-five percent of all women have one episode of candidiasis in their lifetime. Recurrent episodes may indicate underlying immunodeficiency or diabetes. Trichomoniasis is associated with risk factors for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs); elicit a history of multiple sexual paners. The discharge is usually copious, slightly green and frothy, resulting in local pain and irritation. Pruritus might be present. Symptoms often peak just after menses. Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common nonviral STD in the world. Infection during pregnancy has been associated with preterm deliveries and low bih weight infants. Bacterial/ gardnerella vaginosis is asymptomatic in up to 50% of women. If a discharge is present, it is typically a homogeneous grayish white or yellowish white. Bacterial vaginosis is common in pregnant women and is associated with preterm bih.

A: Making endometrium unreceptive There are 2 categories of intrauterine contraceptive devices: Ine and copper -based devices, and Hormonally-based devices that work by releasing a progestogen. Most non-hormonal IUDs have a plastic T-shaped frame that is wound around with pure electrolytic copper wire and/or has copper collars (sleeves). All copper-containing IUDs have a number as pa of their name. This is the surface area of copper (in square millimeters) the IUD provides. Hormonal intra-uterine devices Hormonal uterine devices do not increase bleeding as ine and copper-containing IUDs do. They alter the cervical mucus, makes it thick which prevents penetration of sperm and causes atrophy of the endometrium. Rather, they reduce menstrual bleeding or prevent menstruation altogether, and can be used as a treatment for menorrhagia. Contraindications of IUCD Postpaum between 48 hours and 4 weeks (increased IUD expulsion rate with delayed postpaum inseion) Suspected pregnancy Distoions of the uterine cavity by fibroids or anatomical abnormalities Current PID IUDs may safely be inseed at any time during the menstrual cycle as long as it is reasonably ceain the woman is not pregnant. Inseion may be more comfoable if done midcycle, when the cervix is naturally dilated. Side Effects and Complications The inseion process carries a small, transient increased risk of PID in the first 20 days following inseion. After IUD inseion, Menstrual periods are often heavier, more painful, or both - especially for the first few months after they are inseed. On average, menstrual blood loss increases by 20-50% after inseion of a copper-T IUD. Increased menstrual discomfo is the most common reason for IUCD removal. Complications include expulsion and uterine perforation. The risk of ectopic pregnancy: pregnancies that do occur during IUD use a higher than expected percentage (3-4%) is ectopic.",

Down syndrome Friends, before I go into the details of nuchal translucency I want to first explain why I have opted for Down syndrome as the answer and not Turner syndrome, though increased nuchal translucency is seen in both the conditions. My answer is based on the following lines from USG in Obs. & Gynae. by Callen \"Johnson et al showed that simple nuchal translucency between 10 and 14 weeks were associated with a 60% incidence of abnormal karyotypes-mostly trisomy 21. Unlike the second trimester experience, in which large cystic hygromas were most often associated with turner syndrome, the 45X karyotype represented a minority of the karyotypic abnormalities in the group of fetuses with first trimester nuchal translucency thickening. \" Nuchal translucency and its Significance * Nuchal translucency is a thickening of the nuchal soft tissues. Embryos with aneuploidy have an increased amount of fluid in the neck region resulting in increased NT measurement. The maximum thickness of the subcutaneous translucent area between the skin and soft tissue that overlies the fetus spine in the sagittal plane is measured. A cut off of 3mm is used as threshold for an abnormal nuchal translucency in first trimester and 6mm for second trimester (16 - 20 weeks). Best time to assess nuchal translucency in first trimester 10 - 13 weeks. Best approach - Transvaginal (but trans abdominal is also reasonably good). It is best seen in the mid sagittal plane as a sonolucency at the back of fetal neck. Note: Increased nuchal translucency itself is not a fetal abnormality, but rather a marker or soft sign that confers increased risk of fetal abnormality. Causes of Increased nuchal translucency: - Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) - Trisomy 18 - Trisomy 13 -- Turner syndrome -- Klinefelter syndrome -- Triploidy. Nuchal translucency with large cystic hygroma is seen in Turners syndrome. Nuchal translucency with septations carries bad prognosis. Chromosomally normal fetus with increased nuchal translucency is associated with increased risk of: -- Cardiac abnormalitiesdeg -- Diaphragmatic herniadeg -- Anterior abdominal wall defectdeg -- Fetal akinesia/dyskinesia syndromedeg Therefore, ACOG recommends that when nuchal translucency measurement is 3. 5 mm or more with a normal karyotype, then targeted sonographic examination or fetal echocardiography or both should be done. Nuchal translucency of > 3mm in 1st trimester identifies 67% of fetus with trisomy 21. Increased nuchal fold thickness (> 6mm) is the most sensitive and specific single ultrasound marker for the mid trimester detection of down syndrome. Extra Edge: Nuchal translucency is the most impoant sonographic marker of aneuploidy in the first trimester whereas, Nuchal fold thickness (NFT) is the most impoant sonographic marker of aneuploidy in second trimester. NT is measured from external surface of the skull to the internal surface of the skin. NFT is measured from the external surface of occipital bone to the external surface of skin. NFT is useful for screening between 14-23 weeks. Cut off value for NFT is 5mm (above which it is considered abnormal). Note: In the first trimester 2 most reliable ultrasonographic markers for detecting Down syndrome? Increased muscal translucency Absent nasal bone.",

It can be detected as early as 8-9 days following ovulation, doubles every 2 days in pregnancy and maximum levels are reached between 60-70 days of pregnancy (100-200 IU/ ml) Its role is to prevent the disintegration of the corpus luteum of the ovary and thereby maintain progesterone production that is critical for a pregnancy in humans. Early pregnancy testing, in general, is based on the detection or measurement of h. CG. It is an impoant tumor marker. The beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin is secreted also by choriocarcinoma, germ cell tumors, teratoma and islet cell tumor. The lack of a visible fetus on vaginal ultrasound after the beta h. CG levels have reached 1500 IU/ ml is strongly indicative of an ectopic pregnancy. Gestational trophoblastic disease like Hydatidiform moles (\"molar pregnancy\") or Chroiocarcinoma may produce high levels of beta h.

Squamo-columnar Junction The cervix is lined by columnar epithelium which lines the endocervix (supravaginal pa of cervix) and squamous epithelium which lines the ectocervix (vaginal pa of cervix). The point at which they meet is called as Squamo-Columnar Junction (SCJ). The SCJ originally lies at the level of External OS. With response to hormonal stimulation the subcolumnar reserve cells present below the squamous epithelium undergoes metaplasia and replace the columnar epithelium. Thus location of SCJ is not fixed but keeps migrating and this called as Translormatior) cone The original SCJ can be recognized by Gland openings and Nabothian cysts. \"Nearly all cervical neoplasia, boh squamous and columnar develop within the transformation zone, usually adjacent to the new SCJ. \" This is because theoretically, cervical cells underging metaplasia are more vulnerable to the oncogenic effects of HPV and cocarcinogens. Metaplasia is most active during adolescence and pregnancy that is why early age of sexual activity and first pregnancy are known risk factors for cervical cancer. In women exposed to Diethylstilbesterol (DES) in utero, the original SCJ is located on the vagina rather than on the cervix.",

        "exp": "As soon as pregnancy is diagnosed, oral anticoagulants should be discontinued and subcutaneous heparin should be initiated. In the second trimester, warfarin is the treatment of choice, with INR monitoring. Warfarin should be given only after the 12th gestational week and should be stopped before delivery around 35th week. At the 36th week of gestation, intravenous heparin should be initiated. To avoid the risk of bleeding during labor and delivery, heparin should be discontinued 24 hours prior. Anticoagulation should then be resumed 4 hours after delivery. Must know: Warfarin has been associated with fetal wastage due to spontaneous aboion and stillbihs, optic nerve atrophy and blindness, microcephaly, mental retardation, and even death due to intracranial hemorrhage. Its use in the first trimester is associated with warfarin embryopathy in 4-10% of newborns, a syndrome comprising nasal bone hypoplasia and epiphyseal stippling. Breast-feeding women can be prescribed warfarin because it is not secreted in the breast milk. Complications of heparin administration include abdominal wall hematoma or abscess, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, and osteoporosis. Low-dose aspirin has been safely used in pregnancy.

Prerequisites for forceps delivery include the following: The head must be engaged. The cervix must be fully dilated and retracted. The position of the head must be known. Clinical assessment of pelvic capacity should be performed. No dispropoion should be suspected between the size of the head and the size of the pelvic inlet and mid pelvis.

Since iron absorption is <10% of the total iron intake, therefore to fulfil the requirment of 4-6 mg/day around 40-60mg of the iron should be available in diet.

Such women can have cryopreservation of their embryos and later IVF done. deg Women with normal ovaries but no functional uterus as a result of a congenital anomaly (mullerian agenesis), advanced disease (multiple myeloma, severe intrauterine adhesions) or a previous hysterectomy can be afforded the oppounity to have their own genetic offspring IVF with transfer of embryos to the uterus of a surrogate. deg Women who carry genetic risk or disorder which may be expressed in their offspring can be the candidates for IVF with preimplantation genetics to identify and exclude affected embryos. deg Since. we have to choose one option Tubal pathology i. e. option 'a' is the best option. deg Technique of IVF: Sperms are retrieved using various techniques and prepared by wash and swim up technique. Oocyte is retrieved by vaginal needle aspiration 36 hours after HCG administration. 50000 to 100000 sperms are placed in culture media containing oocyte within 4-6 hours of retrieval. They are examined after 12-24 hours and if they show presence of 2nd polar body, feilization has occurred. The feilized ova at 4-8 cell stage is placed into the uterine cavity close to fundus. Not more than three embryos are transferred per cycle.",

Unlike fetal testis (in which spermatogenesis beings at pubey), the fetal ovary begins oogenesis by 10 weeks of gestation. o The sequence of events in oogenesis are: i) The primitive germ cells undergo mitotic divisions to form oogonia (diploid Oogonium is unique in that it is the only female cell in which both 'X' chromosomes are active. ii) The oogonia proliferate by mitosis to form primary oocytes (diploid cells). iii) Primary oocytes formed from the oogonia enter a prolonged prophase (diplotene stage) of the first meiotic division and remain in this stage until ovulation occurs after pubey. iv) Primary oocytes completes the first meiotic division at pubey just before ovulation to form secondary oocyte (haploid cell) and 1st polor body. v) Secondary oocyte immediately begins second meiotic division but this division stops at metaphase and is completed only if the mature ovum (ootid) is feilized with sperm. At that time second polor body (polocyte) is extruded and the feilized ovum proceeds to form a new individual. Feilization normally occurs in the ampulla of fallopian tube.",

The male sexual dysfunction usually occurs in one or more of the three first stages of the sexual response cycle, including: Dysfunctions of sexual desire (e. g. hypoactive sexual desire). Arousal (e. g. erectile dysfunction). Orgasm/ejaculation (e. g. premature ejaculation, retarded ejaculation or inability to ejaculate). Premature ejaculation occurs due to the rapid evolution of the two first stages of the sexual response cycle and is not necessarily related to strong sexual arousal or changes in erection. Premature Ejaculation seems to be a neurobiological problem that is related to low serotonin levels in those regions of the central nervous system that regulate ejaculation (brain and spinal cord).",
