As another possible site of disease among these high risk patients is fallopian tube therefore should be removed. IN BRCA 1 or BRCA-2 mutation carriers, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BS0) may be performed on either completion of childbearing or at age 35.

Oral contraceptive pills: \u2022 Data received from a multicenter control of genetic screening centers indicates that the use of oral contraceptive pill is associated with 50% decreased risk for developing ovarian cancer in women who have mutation in either in BRCA - 1 or BRCA - 2. However there is short term increased risk of developing breast cancer. c. Role of screening with CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound: \"In BRCA1- BRCA2 mutation carriers who donot wish to undergo prophylactic surgery a combination of through pelvic examination, transvaginal sonographic examination and CA125 blood testing should be done\". \u2022 Best method of prevention: Prophylactic hysterectomy and BSO at 35 years or as soon as family is complete. \u2022 2nd line: OCP's + screening \u2022 Screening: TVS + Ca 125 started at 35 years and done every 6 or 12 months, breast screening by MRI and mamography at 30 years done annually.",

        "exp": "All of these hormones are produced by the placenta, but h. CG is the hormone that maintains the corpus luteum of pregnancy. The synthesis and secretion of h. CG begins about day 6 of pregnancy, presumably from the trophoblast cells. Pregnancy tests utilize the measurement of h. CG for detection of the embryo. Endothelial growth factor (EGF) is synthesized by the cytotrophoblast cells in the early placenta, then is synthesized by the syncytiotrophoblast cells later (6-8 week old placenta). EGF maintains the trophoblasts. Relaxin is synthesized by decidual cells at the time of paurition and acts to \"soften\" the cervix and pelvic ligaments. IGF act similarly to EGF by stimulating differentiation of the cytotrophoblast cells. HCS(Human chorionic somatotropin) is synthesized by syncytiotrophoblast cells and will promote general growth. It is essential in the stimulation of mammary duct proliferation in development of the breast during pregnancy. Ref: Cunningham F. G., Leveno K. J., Bloom S. L., Hauth J. C., Rouse D. J., Spong C. Y.

Human papilloma virus is a non enveloped DNA virus with a protein capsid It is epihelio tropic and has high affinity for lower ano genital tract. Maximum age of incidence of HPV is under 25 years. Viral Life Cycle: The HPV genome consist of early genes (E) and late genes (L). Early genes are expressed most strongly within the basal and parabasal layers. The late genes encoding capsid proteins are expressed later in superficial layers. Intact virus is shed within superficial squama. Late genes are not strongly expressed in high grade neoplastic lesions. Transmission * It is transmitted by sexual contact with genital skin, mucus membrane or body fluids of a paner with either was or subclinical infection. Congenital HPV infection by veical transmission from mother to infant develops rarely. Conjunctival, laryngeal, vulvar or peineal was present at bih are most likely due to perinatal exposure to maternal HPV in absence of sexual abuse. Infection is not related to the presence of maternal genital was or route of delivery. So caesarean delivery is recommended only in case of large genital was that would obstruct delivery or avulse with cervical dilation. Diagnosis: is made by the direct detection of HPV DNA. This can be done histologically by in situ hybridization, by nucleic acid amplification PCR; or by hybrid capture (HC) technique. Currently, Hybrid capture 2 is the most common technique in clinical use. It is a chemiluminescent test that uses a mixture of RNA probes for the detection of 13 oncogenic HPV types.",

Vasa pre is a condition in which the fetal blood vessels unsuppoed by either umbilical cord or placental tissue are trapped between fetus and opening of the bih canal. This condition is associated with low lying placenta. There is considerable potential danger to the fetus because the membrane rupture is accompanied by tearing of fetal vessels which may lead to severe fetal bleeding. Fetal hypoxia and death may also be caused when the vessels are compressed by the fetal presenting pa, paicularly during uterine contractions. The amount of blood loss required to cause fetal death is very small thus the fetal moality in vasa pre is about 75-100%. Surprisingly there is little if any increase in maternal complications. Diagnosis of Vasa pre should be considered in all cases of third trimester bleeding associated with an FHR monitoring trace suggestive of fetal compromise or cord compression.

Endometriosis is defined as a benign growth of endometrium at sites at which it does not normally occur (excluding the myometrium, at which site it is called adenomyosis). Endometriosis is common and is a significant cause of both pain and pelvic scarring. Most of the problems occur because the abnormally located endometrium responds to hormonal control and may menstruate, producing a very irritating fluid. Endometriosis may apparently be staed either by seeding of menstrual cells in the pelvis (entering through the open end of the fallopian tubes) or by metaplasia of mesothelial or other cells (accounting for rare, well-documented cases of endometriosis of bizarre sites such as nasal mucosa or lungs). Acute endometritis is acute inflammation of the endometrium. Adenomyosis is characterized by foci of endometrium deep in the myometrium. Chronic endometritis is chronic inflammation of the endometrium. Ref: Hoffman B. L., Schorge J. O., Schaffer J. I., Halvorson L. M., Bradshaw K. D., Cunningham F. G., Calver L. E. (2012). Chapter 10.

        "question": "A 57-year-old woman presents to a physician with chronic pelvic pain of many years duration. On fuher questioning, the woman also repos urinary frequency, constipation, pain with intercourse and bloating. On physical examination, a large mass is felt in the pelvic area. Follow-up ultrasound examination demonstrates that the mass involves the right adnexa and is composed of multiloculated cystic spaces. Prior to sending the patient to surgery, the primary care physician wants to order a serum tumor marker to screen for ovarian cancer. Which of the following would be the best choice?",
        "exp": "The diagnosis of ovarian cancer is often delayed, because symptoms often do not occur until late in the disease when the mass is large and applies pressure to other abdominal organs. The symptoms illustrated in the case are typical. Patients may also develop ascites with shoness of breath, a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms related to impaired motility secondary to pressure, and, if the ovarian cancer is a type that secretes hormones, menstrual irregularities or abnormal hair growth. The most widely studied tumor marker in ovarian cancer is CA-125. This marker is not of paicular use in screening of the general population for two reasons: 1) small cancers often do not cause serum elevations of the marker; and 2) serum levels of the marker can be elevated by a variety of cancers (including those of ovary, breast, pancreas, colon, and lung) and benign conditions (including endometriosis, pregnancy, liver disease, and congestive heart failure). However, if there is already a strong suspicion or a known history of ovarian cancer, CA-125 can be helpful in establishing if the cancer burden (if present) is large, and whether following the CA-125 levels following surgery can be used to monitor for recurrent disease. While small tumors are not always picked up (50% of women with small ovarian cancers have normal CA-125), more than 80% of women with advanced ovarian cancer have CA-125 elevations. Adrenocoicotropic hormone can be elevated in ectopic hormone-producing lung cancers. Galactosyltransferase can be elevated in a wide variety of cancers, including those from lung, breast, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and colon. It is not used as a marker for ovarian cancer. S-100 is a marker for melanoma and neuroendocrine tumors.",

Mifepristone, is an analogue of the progestin \"norethindrone\". which has strong affinity for progesterone receptors but acts as an antagonist of progesterone. Given alone, the drug was moderately useful in causing aboion of early pregnancy, however the combination of mifepristone with analogue of prostaglandin E, i. e. misoprostol is very effective. hegimen: FDA approved protocol - (Original protocol): 600 mg of Mifepristone (i. e. 3 tablets) given orally on day 1 followed 2 days later by oral misoprostol 400 pg (2 tablets) on day 3. The treatment should be staed no more than 49 days from the sta of the last menstrual period. But according to the recent protocol: 200 mg of mifepristone (it is as effective as 600 mg of mifepristone) is given orally on Day 1 followed 2 days later by vaginal misoprostol 800 pg. ibis regime provides highest efficacy within 63 bays of amenorrhea. Role of mifepristone in Medical aboion: Mifepristone blocks progesterone receptors in the endometrium which leads to disruption of the embryo. production of prostaglandins and a decrease in human chorionic gonadotropin levels. The success rate is dependant on the length of pregnancydeg - the more dependant the pregnancy is on progesterone from the corpus luteum, the more likely that the progesterone antagonist, mifepristone will result in aboion. The production of prostaglandins leads to softening of the cervix as well.

Main question is whether we would like to go for conservative surgery or Radical surgery (i. e. TAH with BSO). Conservative surgery: The clinical situations involving conservative surgery include ovarian endometrioma, pelvic adhesions, peritoneal implants and deep infiltrative recto vaginal septum disease. In addition laser laparoscopy can be used in order to perform uterine nerve ablation... Radical Surgery: Whilst repeated conservative surgery and medical therapy help many women, only some women fail to find pain relief after recurrence, which is the major drawback of conservative surgery. For these women, radical surgery is the only option and involves Hysterectomy with Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. According to \"Hysterectomy with bilateral oopherectomy should be reserved for women who have completed childbearing and recognise the risk of premature hypoestrogenism including possible osteoporosis and decrease libido. \" Note: Hysterectomy without BSO is not done in case of endometriosis due to 6 fold increase risk of recurrent chronic pelvic pain and 8 fold risk of repeat surgery.",

Digital pressure applied to the paraurethral tissues in an anterior direction through the vagina reestablishes the urethrovesical angle and prevents stress incontinence (Marshall-Bonney test). Treatment includes behavioral therapy and perineal exercises; if unsuccessful, pharmacologic methods include oxybutynin and ephedrine. Definitive management is surgical. Ref: Cooper C. S., Joudi F.

Modern theories suggest that the true primary lesion may involve the endothelium, and that medical control of hypertension actually only treats a small pa of the syndrome. At present, the only definitive therapy is delivery of the baby, and obstetricians often play a delicate game trying to delay delivery for a premature baby's sake as long as possible while judging the severity of the preeclampsia and its immediate risks to mother and fetus. Low dose aspirin may have a modest effect in preventing pre-eclampsia, but this is not yet well established. Oxygen supplementation is used in some cases of cerebral hemorrhage secondary to preeclampsia, but does not constitute definitive therapy. Ref: Cunningham F. G., Leveno K. J., Bloom S. L., Hauth J.

X-ray pelvimetry cannot assess the other factors. It cannot reliably predict the likelihood of vaginal delivery neither in breech presentation nor in cases with previous cesarean section. X-ray pelvimetry is useful in cases with fractured pelvis and for the important diameters which are inaccessible to clinical examination. Techniques: For complete evaluation of the pelvis, three views are taken - anteroposterior, lateral and outlet. But commonly, X-ray pelvimetry is restricted to only the erect lateral view (the femoral head and acetabular margins must be superimposed) which gives most of the useful information. Anteroposterior view can give the accurate measurement of the transverse diameter of the inlet and bispinous diameter. Hazards of X-ray pelvimetry includes radiation exposure to the mother and the fetus. With conventional X-ray pelvimetry radiation exposure to the gonads is about 885 millirad.

The tissues sensitive to estrogen include brain, bone, skin cardiovascular and genitourinary tissues. Consequently the two aims of hormone replacement therapy are: (i) To reduce time everyday symptoms of oestrogen loss; hot flushes, sleeplessness, lethargy, depression and vaginal dryness. All types of H (oestrogen with or without progesterone) are effective in reducing the hot flushes experienced by more than 50% of postmenopausal women. The benefit is most during the first year of treatment when 80% of women repo a reduced likelihood of flushes. The other major use from H is the relief of vaginal dryness. Vaginal administration is the most effective route for treatment of dyspareunia and related symptoms. (ii) To prevent fractures Estrogen prevents osteoporotic fractures Effect of H on coronary aery disease Until recently it was believed that beneficial effect of estrogen on lipids, decrease the risk of coronary aery disease in women on hormone replacement therapy.

It is chemically similar to tamoxifen Clomiphene is a non steroidal triphenylethylene derivative which demonstrates both estrogen agonist and antagonist propeies (predominant). It is the agent of choice for women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea having sufficient ovarian function to maintain estrogen at a serum level of 40pg/ml. Patient selection: Normal gonadotropicdeg normoprolactinemicdeg patients with normal cycle with absent or infrequent ovulation. deg PCOSdeg Post pill amenorrhea. deg Dose: Initial dose of 25 to 50mgdeg is given daily from D2 - D 5. Ovulation is expected to occur about 5 - 7 days after the last day of therapy. If ovulation doesnot occur, dose is increased in 50mg steps to a maximum of 250mg daily. (Although doses > 100 mg /day are not approved by FDA). Therapy is in given for 4-6 cycles. Clomiphene will be successful in inducing ovulation in about 70% of women, with ovaries producing estrogen Switch over from clomiphene to more aggressive therapy is done when: There is no response to clomiphenedeg (even with 100 mg / day dosing). There is ovulatory response to clomiphene but no pregnancydeg (following 3 to 6 months of ovulatory response to clomiphene). Patients with pituitary insufficiencydeg These patients usually respond to Gonadotropins. Note: Letrozole - 2. 5mg (non steroidal aromatase inhibitor) is found superior to clomiphene. 2. Gonadotropin therapy: Prerequisite for Gonadotropin therapy: Ovarian reserve must be present. The Gonadotropins used are Human menopausal Gonodotropin: -- It is a formulation containing equal amounts of FSH and LH (751U each). -- It is prepared from hormones obtained from urine of postmenopausal women. HCG is required as an ovulatory trigger. FSH: purified urinary FSH and Recombinant FSH are also available. 3. Gonadotropin releasing hormone: Pulsatile Gn. RH: If other methods have failed then pulsatile Gn. RH is needed in patients with anovulation and hypothalamic insufficiency. Other drugs which can be used to for ovulation: Bromocriptine/Cabergoline: Are used to to treat anovulation caused by increase in serum prolactin level. Coicosteroids: Use to treat anovulation due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Also know: Mangement of unilateral proximal tubal block: Hysteroscopic cannulation or microsurgical tubo cornual anastomosis (if any periadenaxal adhesions are also present). Management of distal tubal block: Best is IVF. Surgical procedures like fimbrioplasty (lysis of fimbrial adhesions or dilatation of fimbrial stenosis) or neosalpingostomy may be done. Management of distal tubal block by hydrosalperix First laparoscopic salpingectomy followed by IVF Management of Bipolar tubal obstruction i. e. both proximal and distal tubal obstruction. Best is IVF Extra Edge: Lets quickly revise the tests for tubal patency. Tests for tubal patency: Rubins test: Outdateddeg Hysterosalpingography: screening procedure. deg Hystero contrastosonography Laparoscopy: Best technique for diagnosis of tubal and peritoneal pathology. deg Selective salpingography and falloscopy For evaluation of proximal tube obstruction.

        "question": "During early pregnancy, the trophoblastic cells secrete which of the following hormones in order to maintain the corpus luteum?",
        "exp": "At approximately the midpoint of the menstrual cycle, the ovum is expelled. Once this occurs, the surrounding granulosa and theca cells undergo luteinization and begin to secrete a large amount of estrogen and progesterone. This mass of hormone secreting cells is known as the corpus luteum (because of its yellow color). If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum will persist for 14 days, after which point it degenerates. With the degeneration of the corpus luteum, hormone levels drop, the endometrium sloughs, and menstruation occurs. If a pregnancy does occur, the trophoblastic cells of the pregnancy will secrete human chorionic gonadotropin (h. CG). This hormone goes to the corpus luteum and prevents its degradation, signaling it to continue its excretion of estrogen and progesterone to maintain an environment that is orable for pregnancy. The presence of human chorionic gonadotropin forms the basis for the urine and serum pregnancy test. h. CG steadily increases over the first several weeks of the pregnancy, reaching a peak at approximately 10 weeks. After that, h. CG levels decrease gradually during the remainder of the pregnancy. During early pregnancy, most women experience some nausea. One of the leading theories for the cause of this nausea is the hormone h. CG, because the nausea of early pregnancy appears to mirror the rise and fall of the h. CG levels--peaking at roughly 10 weeks and improving after that. Note: Estrogen and progesterone are produced by the corpus luteum during early pregnancy. The corpus luteum does not degenerate in a pregnant woman, as it does in the nonpregnant woman, because the trophoblastic cells secrete human chorionic gonadotropin (h. CG). After the first months of pregnancy, the placenta takes over the role of secreting the large amounts of estrogen and progesterone that are needed to continue a healthy pregnancy. Once the placenta has taken over this role, the corpus luteum degenerates. Luteinizing hormone (LH) is produced by the anterior pituitary gland. Its rate of secretion is controlled mainly by the hypothalamus, through hypothalamic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH, also called Gn. RH) secretion. The LH surge, which occurs roughly at the midpoint of the menstrual cycle, appears to cause ovulation, which occurs approximately 24 hours after the surge. LH also appears to induce the theca and granulosa cells to become the corpus luteum. Also Know: Chorionic gonadotropin is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 36, 000 to 40, 000 Da. It has the highest carbohydrate content of any human hormone--30 percent. Although h. CG is produced almost exclusively in the placenta, it also is synthesized in fetal kidney. The intact h. CG molecule is detectable in plasma of pregnant women 7 to 9 days after the midcycle surge of LH that precedes ovulation. Thus, it is likely that h. CG enters maternal blood at the time of blastocyst implantation. Plasma levels increase rapidly, doubling every 2 days, with maximal levels being attained at 8 to 10 weeks. Ref: Cunningham F.

Indications of surgical management of fibroid: Fibroid causing symptoms: - Menorrhagiadeg - Chronic / Acute, Pelvic paindeg - Pressure symptoms like urinary retention. deg Fibroid like cornual fibroid causing infeility. deg Sub mucous fibroid causing infeility (Other causes of infeility should be ruled out before surgery). deg Surgical options can be: Myomectomy Hysterectomy Indication of myomectomy: Myomectomy is specifically indicated in an infeile woman or woman desirous of bearing child and wishing to retain the uterus. Indications being the same as for surgery. deg Some specific indications for Hysterectomy: In patients > 40 years of age. deg Multiparous women. deg If fibroid is associated with malignancy. deg During myomectomy if their is uncontrolled hemorrhage or other surgical difficulty. deg If the size of uterus is < 12 weeks vaginal hysterectomy can be done. deg Myomectomy is the enucleation of myomata from the uterus leaving behind a potentially functioning organ capable of future reproduction. deg Prerequisites: Anemia should be corrected. deg - All other causes of infeility should be excluded. deg - Male factor infeility should be ruled out. deg - Diagnostic D and C should be performed in case of irregular cycles, to detect any polyp and to rule out endometrial cancer. deg - Hysteroscopy or HSG: To detect a fibroid encroaching the uterine cavity or a polyp or tubal block. deg Myomectomy is specifically indicated in an infeile woman or woman desirous of bearing child and wishing to retain the uterus. deg Time of myomectomy: It should be performed in preovulatory menstrual phase to reduce blood loss during surgery. deg It should not be performed during pregnancy and at the time of cesarean section. deg Contraindications: Big broad ligament fibroid: (as many large vessels are present which can cause uncontrollable bleeding and thus the need to abandon myomectomy and do hysterectomy. deg Multiple tiny fibroids scattered through the uterine wall. deg Instrument used to decrease blood loss during myomectomy: bonney's myomectomy clamp. deg Myomectomy operation should always be followed by shoening of round ligament to prevent retroversion. deg Bonney's hood technique: is done in interstitial fibroid on the fundal posterior wall. deg Results (Impoant): Pregnancy rate following myomectomy: 40%deg Aboion rates if woman conceive: 25%deg Myomectomy: Low grade postoperative pyrexia is a rule and should not be treated by antibiotics (pyrexia is d/t slight extravasation of blood in uterine wall or peritoneal cavity and settles spontaneously in 7-14 days). Recurrence rate: 5-10%deg Persisting menorrhagia 1-5%deg Reason for persisting menorrhagia is either myoma was not responsible for the complain or an intrauterine polyp or fibroid was overlooked during surgery. 20 - 25% women subjected to myomectomy: ultimately come for hysterectomy. Routes of myomectomy Abdominal Vaginal myomectomy Myomectomy Done in case of submucosal pedunculated fibroid Hysteroscopic myomectomy Submucosal fibroiddeg which cannot be removed by simple vaginal route can be removed with the help of hysteroscope Laparoscopic Myomectomy Indicated for pedunculated Subserosal fibroids (<10cms in size) Intramural fibroids can also be removed by laparoscope but it is very time consuming Myolysis or myoma coagulation using laser In this procedure lasers are used to drill holes into the substance of intramural myoma",

MMR vaccination can be given during lactation and does not affect the baby. The CDC recommends that non-pregnant women who receive the MMR vaccine or varicella vaccination should wait four weeks before getting pregnant. In situations where inactivated virus or pas of a virus are administered, in general, there is no contraindication to immunization during pregnancy. Thus influenza vaccination is given to pregnant women at risk, as are vaccinations against hepatitis A and B. HPV vaccine was introduced in 2006. It is not to be used during pregnancy. BCG(Live attenuated bacterial) vaccine is used against tuberculosis and is contraindicated in pregnancy Inactivated bacterial vaccine is used during pregnancy for women who have a specific risk of exposure and disease. Vaccination against pneumococcus or meningococcus infections, or typhoid fever show no confirmed side effects regarding the fetus.

The primitive germ cells take their origin from yolk sac at about the end of 3rd week and migrate to the developing gonadal ridge, at about the end of 4th week. Important facts: Oogenesis begins in the ovary at 6-8 weeks of gestation. Maximum number of oocytes/oogonia are in the ovary at 5th month of development (20 weeks of gestation number being 6-7 million). At birth no more mitotic division occur, all oogonia are replaced by primary oocyte. At birth total content of both ovaries is 2 million primary oocytes. At puberty number is further decreased and is ~ 300000-500000, of which only 500 are destined to mature during an individual's life time. All the primary oocytes in the ovary of a newborn are arrested in the diplotene stage of prophase (of meiosis). All the primary oocytes then remain arrested and the arrested phase is called as \"Dictyate stage\" till puberty. The primary oocyte gets surrounded by follicular cells in the ovary and this structure is now called as Primordial follicle. At puberty as a result of mid cycle preovulatory surge, meiosis is resumed and completed just prior to ovulation. Therefore first polar body is released just prior to ovulation or along with ovulation.. The second division starts immediately after it and is arrested in metaphase. At the time of fertilization second division is completed which results in the release of oocyte and second polar body. Therefore second polar body is released only at the time of fertilisation. Size of mature ovum = 120-130 \u03bcm (It is the largest cell in the body). Size of mature follicle = 18-20 mm",

The difference between these two types of aboion is of fundamental impoance. The lack of development of fetal structures defines a subset of aboions of genetic origin. In contrast, the early interruption of fetal life is a complex phenomenon with multiple etiologies.

Follicular Phase Through the influence of a rise in (FSH), five to seven teiary-stage ovarian follicles are recruited for entry into the next menstrual cycle. One (or occasionally two) dominant follicles will continue to maturity and secrete increasing amounts of estradiol which initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium Ovulation When the egg has matured, it secretes enough estradiol to trigger the acute release of (LH). In the average cycle this LH surge stas around cycle 12th day and may last 48 hours and leads to ovulation. At the time of ovulation, the cervical mucus is thin and has the propey of great elasticity and this is called spinnbarkeiti thread test under estrogenic activity. When viewed under the microscope, the mucus shows characteristic pattern of fern formation, which is due to presence of sodium chloride in the mucus secreted under estrogenic effect. Luteal phase After ovulation, the residual follicle transforms into the corpus luteum. This corpus luteum will produce Progesterone in addition to estrogens for approximately the next 2 weeks. Progesterone plays a vital role in conveing the proliferative endometrium into a secretory lining receptive for implantation and suppoive of the early pregnancy. It raises the body temperature. Hormonal control Gonadal Estradiol peaks twice, during follicular growth and during the luteal phase. Progesterone remains viually absent prior to ovulation, but becomes critical in the luteal phase and during pregnancy. Many tests for ovulation check for the presence of progesterone. After ovulation the corpus luteum which develops from the burst follicle and remains in the ovary secretes both estradiol and progesterone. Hypothalamus and pituitary These sex hormones come under the influence of the pituitary gland, and both FSH and LH play necessary roles: FSH stimulates immature follicles in the ovaries to grow. LH triggers ovulation. The Gonadotropin releasing hormone of the hypothalamus controls the pituitary, yet both the pituitary and the hypothalamus receive feedback from the follicle.",

Estrogen administration will exe a negative feedback on gonadotropin secretion and decreases Gonadotropin secretion rather than increasing it (Option 'a' ruled out). As I have already discussed in previous Question -Estrogen decreases LDL and not increases it (ruling out Option `b). Now we are left with 2 options, Option 'c' i. e. Bone mass and Option 'rile. Muscle mass. Estrogen given as hormone replacement therapy is most beneficial in preventing osteoporosis i. e it must be increasing bone mass. So, Option 'c'seems to be correct. Now have a look what texts have to say: Estrogen helps to maintain bone mass and skeletal integrity thereby protecting against osteoporosis. Effect of estrogen on bones: Estrogen causes increased osteoblastic activity in the bones. It is impoant in maintaining bone mass primarily by retarding bone resorption. The major action of estrogen is directed at reducing the maturation and activity of osteoclasts, by modifying regulatory cytokine signals from osteoblasts. The action of estrogen and progesterone result in increased expression of bone matrix proteins such as osteonectin, osteocalcin, collagen and alkaline phosphatase. Extra Edge: An overveiw of osteoporosis Risk factors for osteoporosis Non modifiable Modifiable Associated Medical Conditions * Age * Race (caucasian, asian) * Small body frame * Early menopause * Prior fracture * Family history of osteoporosis Inadequate intake of calcium and vitamin D Smoking Low body weight Excess alcohol use Sedentary lifestyle Hypehyroidism Hyperparathyroidism Chronic renal disease Conditions requiring systemic coicosteroid use Diagnosis: Bone Mineral Density Measurement (BMD) Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) of hip and spine is the primary technique for BMD assessment. BMD is expressed as a T score, which is the number of standard detions from the mean for a young healthy woman. A T score above --1 is considered normal, a value between --1 and --2. 5 denotes osteopenia and a score below --2. 5 indicates osteoporosis. Evaluation of BMD by DXA is recommended for all women aged 65 and older, regardless of risk factors and for younger postmenopausal women with 1 or more risk factors.

Classification Most endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas Endometrial carcinomas can be classified into two pathogenetic groups: Type I: These cancers occur most commonly in pre- and peri-menopausal women, often with a history of unopposed estrogen exposure and/or endometrial hyperplasia. They are often minimally invasive into the underlying uterine wall, are of the low-grade endometrioid type, and carry a good prognosis. Type II: These cancers occur in older, post-menopausal women, and are not associated with increased exposure to estrogen. They are typically of the high-grade endometrioid, papillary serous or clear cell types, and carry a generally poor prognosis Risk factors High levels of estrogen Endometrial hyperplasia Polycystic ovary syndrome Nulliparity Infeility Early menarche Late menopause Endometrial polyps or other benign growths of the uterine lining Tamoxifen Hyperplasia Pelvic radiation therapy Breast cancer Ovarian cancer Clinical evaluation A Pap smear may be either normal or show abnormal cellular changes. Endometrial curettage is the traditional diagnostic method. If endometrial curettage does not yield sufficient diagnostic material, a dilation and curettage (D and C) is necessary for diagnosing the cancer. Endometrial biopsy or aspiration may assist the diagnosis. Transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal Pathology The most common finding is a well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which is composed of numerous, small, crowded glands with varying degrees of nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and stratification. Fuher evaluation Colonoscopy is recommended due to the etiologic factors common to both endometrial cancer and colon cancer. Staging Endometrial carcinoma is surgically staged using the FIGO cancer staging system. i a. Stage IA: tumor is limited to the endometrium i b. Stage IB: invasion of less than half the myometrium i c. Stage IC: invasion of more than half the myometrium ii a. Stage IIA: endocervical glandular involvement only ii b. Stage IIB: cervical stromal invasion iii a. Stage IIIA: tumor invades serosa or adnexa, or malignant peritoneal cytology iii b. Stage IIIB: vaginal metastasis iii c. Stage IIIC: metastasis to pelvic or para-aoic lymph nodes iv a. Stage IVA: invasion of the bladder or bowel iv b. Stage IVB: distant metastasis, including intraabdominal or inguinal lymph nodes Treatment Abdominal hysterectomy is recommended over vaginal hysterectomy because it affords the oppounity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any fuher evidence of cancer.",

A common cause of hematuria during labour is obstructed labour. \"In obstructed labour the bladder becomes an abdominal organ and due to compression of urethra between the presenting pa and symphysis pubis, the patient. fails to empty the bladder. The transverse depression at the junction of the superior border of the bladder and the distended lower segment is often confused with the Bandls's ring. The bladder wall gets traumatized which may lead to blood stained urine, a common finding in obstructed labour\". Clinical features of impending scar rupture:? Tenderness over the site of uterine scar. Uterine contractions become tetanic. Signs of extreme fetal distress or death. Maternal tachycardia. Slight elevation in maternal temperature.",

It has the advantage of being readily available and having no effect on breast feeding. They also provide protection against sexually transmitted diseases but can be irritating to vaginal tissue and may require additional lubrication. Barrier methods are an excellent choice in motivated couples\" Lactational amenorrhea For mothers who are nursing exclusively, ovulation occurring during the first 10 weeks after delivery is unlikely. But it is not a reliable method if mother is nursing only in day time. Waiting for first menses involves a risk of pregnancy because ovulation usually antedates menstruation. Safe period method -- In this method the feile period is calculated and the female should refrain from having sex during that period The basic prerequisite of this method is that cycles should be regular which is usually not the case with lactating mothers -- safe period method is not applicable in them.

Mullerian agenesis is a congenital malformation characterized by a failure of the Mullerian duct to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper poion. Mullerian agenesis (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the cause in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea. Because ovaries do not develop from the Mullerian ducts, affected women might have normal secondary sexual characteristics but are infeile due to the lack of a functional uterus. Signs and Symptoms: An individual with this condition is hormonally normal; that is, the person will enter pubey with development of secondary sexual characteristics including thelarche and adrenarche (pubic hair). The person's chromosome constellation will be 46, XX. At least one ovary is intact, if not both, and ovulation usually occurs. Typically, the vagina is shoened and intercourse may, in some cases, be difficult and painful. Medical examination suppoed by gynecologic ultrasonography demonstrates a complete or paial absence of the cervix, uterus, and vagina.

Specifically, women with an abrupt onset, typically within several months, or sudden worsening of virilising signs should prompt concern for a hormone producing ovarian or adrenal tumor. Symptoms may include deepening of voice, frontal balding, severe acne or hirsutism or both, increased muscle mass and clitoromegaly. Accordingly, serum testosterone levels may be used to exclude these tumors. Free testosterone levels are more sensitive than total testosterone levels as an indicator of hyperandrogenism. Although improving, current free testosterone assays lack a uniform laboratory standard. For this reason. total testostrerone levels remain the best approach for excluding a tumor. Threshold values beyond 200 ng / dl of total testosterone warrant evaluation for an ovarian leison. \" So now I do not need to explain that testosterone estimation is the best investigation in case of rapid onset hirsutism and amennorhea. Also know: Other investigations to be done in an Anovulatory hirsute female: -- Serum 170H progesterone levels (to rule out congenital adrenal hyperplasia). Serum TSH -- Serum Prolactin -- Insulin (as hyper insulinemia leads to hirsutism) -- 24 hour urinary free coisol excretion and evening plasma coisol level (to rule out cushing syndrome). -- LH/FSH ratio (for diagnosing PCOS).",

As discussed earlier not only it is the first imaging test which should be done but is also the imaging modality of choice (option a is correct). Color Doppler sonography can identify the placental shape (ring of fire pattern) and blood flow pattern outside the urine cavity. It is used to diagnose those cases of ectopic pregnancy which cannot be identified by TVS (i. e. option c is incorrect). USG findings in ectopic pregnnacy include demosntration of an extra uterine gestational sac appearing as fluid containing structure with an echogenic ring, \"the tubal ring sign\" (i. e. option d is correct: A single estimation of fih.

In fact, the risk of fetal distress in those patients is as low as in non diabetics and fetal well being can be assessed by teaching the patients about fetal movements and asking them to fill up a chart for kick counts. On the other hand, high risk gestational diabetics and patients on glyburide and/or insulin should have antepartum fetal surveillance testing starting at 32-34 weeks of gestation. There is no conscensus as to what is the best test for these patients. Weekly or twice weekly NST are the most popular. However biophysical profile (BPP) the modified biophysical profile and CST are also used. \" Fernando Arias 3/e, p 449 According to COGDT 10/e, p 315 \"Surveillance for fetal well being often begins at 32 weeks gestation in patients with end organ disease using a twice weekly NST or modified BPP done twice weekly by measuring the fetal heart rate an the amniotic fluid volume. A weekly BPP is similarly useful. Women without end organ disease who requrie insulin often begin fetal monitoring at 32-34 weeks. Women with diet controlled gestational diabetes usually begin testing at 36-40 weeks until delivered. Maternal fetal movement monitoring check count using a count to 10 or similar method is recommended for all pregnant women, including those with diabetes to reduce the stillbirth rate.

Mechanism of action: - it prevents implantation through endometrial changes and does not inhibit ovulation. - increases transpo of zygote through the fallopian tube. - It accelerates blastocyst formation. Developed by CDRI, Lucknow and released in India by 2 trade names Saheli and Centron. Exhibits strong anti-estrogenic and a weak estrogenic actions peripherally at receptor level. It is not teratogenic or carcinogenic, exes no pharmacological effect on other organs. The only side effect noted is prolonged cycles and oligomenorrhea in 8% cases. This is due to prolonged proliferative cases. Pregnancy rate is (1-4 )/100 women years. Return of feility is within 6 months of stopping the drug. The drug can also be used as a post coital pill, given in 60 mg dose within 24 hours of coitus, 2 tablets repeated after 12 hours with a failure rate of 1%. Side effects - headache, nausea, vomiting, gain in weight, does not protect against HIV and STD, Prolonged cycles (due to prolonged proliferative phase) and oligomenorrhea (in 8% cases). There is some delay in return of feility.

It usually refers to ectopic endometrial tissue (the inner lining of the uterus) within the myometrium (the thick, muscular layer of the uterus). The condition is typically found in women between the ages of 35 and 50. Patients with adenomyosis can have dysmenorrhea & menorrhagia. In adenomyosis, basal endometrium penetrates into hyperplastic myometrial fibers. Therefore, unlike functional layer, basal layer does not undergo typical cyclic changes with menstrual cycle.

        "exp": "Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a significant cause of morbidity among sexually active menstruating women. PID refers to an upper genital tract infection, especially of the endosalpingeal cells that line the fallopian tubes. When the infection involves the fallopian tubes only, it is referred to as a salpingitis. When it involves the ovaries as well, it is then referred to as a salpingo-oophoritis. The endometrium is also often involved (endometritis). The peak incidence of the disease is in the 15- to 24-year-old-group. This patient presents with the typical symptoms of PID, paicularly abdominal/pelvic pain. Fever and vaginal discharge are often present in gonococcal PID, but may be absent in other forms of PID. The diagnosis of PID is made when the patient has abdominal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, and adnexal tenderness plus a temperature > 38 C (100. 4 F), or leukocytosis (>10, 000/mm3), or laboratory documentation of chlamydial or gonorrheal infection. Treatment is with antibiotics. Ectopic pregnancy is ruled out with the negative urine pregnancy test. An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that is implanted abnormally, most often in the fallopian tubes. As a pregnancy, it secretes human chorionic gonadotropin (h. CG), which can be found in the blood or urine. When this is not present, ectopic pregnancy is ruled out. Gonococcal cervicitis presents with findings localized to the cervix. This patient has findings that go beyond a cervicitis. Given her abdominal tenderness with rebound, cervical motion tenderness, and adnexal tenderness, she is manifesting involvement of the fallopian tubes and peritoneum. While the gonococcus may be the offending organism in this case, this patient has more than a gonococcal cervicitis. A patient with a spontaneous aboion can present in a variety of ways, but most commonly she will present with complaints of vaginal bleeding or the passage of tissue from the vagina. A spontaneous aboion represents a failed pregnancy and this patient has no evidence of a failed pregnancy, and an abundance of evidence for PID.",
