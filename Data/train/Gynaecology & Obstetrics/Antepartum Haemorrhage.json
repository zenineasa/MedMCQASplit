These findings point towards the diagnosis of placenta previa (In abruptio-bleeding is accompanied by pain, uterus is tense, tender and rigid). The gestational age of patient is 39 weeks i. e., fetal maturity is attained so pregnancy has to be terminated, either vaginally or by cesarean section. Now to decide the mode of delivery, we need to know which of placenta previa it is. This can be known by USG or pelvic examination in OT. Since USG is not given in options so answer is pelvic examination in OT. Also Know: Conditions where vaginal examination should not be done (even in OT): 1. Patient is in exsanguinated state Q2. Diagnosed case of placenta previa on USG Q3. Associated complicating factors such as malpresentation, elderly primigravida, previous cesarean section, contracted pelvis etc Q which prevent vaginal delivery. As in all these conditions cesarean section is mandatory (so no point in wasting time to know the type of placenta previa by vaginal examination and taking the risk of occurrence of brisk hemorrhage).",

Used to detect differentiate Fetal or neonatal blood from maternal blood (Qualitative). Clinical Uses: o Vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy is tested to rule out Vasa previa. o Neonatal bloody vomitus or bloody stool to rule out swallowed maternal blood. o To detect the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation in cases of suspected fetal-maternal hemorrhage. Positive test indicates that blood is of fetal origin. Negative test indicates that the blood is o* maternal origin. Principle. Fetal hemoglobin (alpha 2 gamma 2 subunits) is resistant to alkali (basic) denaturation, whereas Adult hemoglobin (alpha 2 beta 2 subunits) is susceptible to such denaturation. Exposing the blood specimen to sodium hydroxide (Na. OH) will denature the adult but NOT the feta! hemoglobin. The fetal hemoglobin will appear as a pinkish color under the microscope while the adult hemoglobin will appear as a yellow- brownish color. Method. The blood is mixed with sterile water to cause hemolysis of the RBCs, yielding free hemoglobin. The 5 ml pink hemoglobin-containing supernatant is then mixed with 1 mL of 1% Na. OH. Fetal hemoglobin will stay pink and adult hemoglobin will turn yellow-brown. Adult hemoglobin changes colour because it is less stable and will convert to hematin.",

        "exp": "Nausea, fatigue, breast tenderness, and urinary frequency are all common symptoms of pregnancy, but their presence cannot definitively make the diagnosis of pregnancy because they are nonspecific symptoms that are not consistently found in early pregnancy. On physical exam, the pregnant uterus enlarges and becomes boggier and softer, but these changes are not usually apparent until after 6 weeks gestational age. In addition, other conditions such as adenomyosis, fibroids, or previous pregnancies can result in an enlarged uterus being palpated on physical exam. Abdominal ultrasound will not demonstrate a gestational sac until a gestational age of 5 to 6 weeks is reached. A Doppler instrument will detect fetal cardiac action usually no sooner than 10 weeks.

All these favour the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism. Amniotic fluid embolism: It is characterized by an abrupt onset of respiratory distress and coagulopathy. Amniotic fluid enters the circulation and sets up a disseminated intravascular coagulation, leading to consumptive coagulopathy. Classically a woman in late labor or immediate postpartum gasps for air, has bronchospasm, becomes cyanotic and undergoes immediate collapse and cardiorespiratory arrest, usually accompanied by hemorrhage. Sudden death is usual. It is diagnosed clinically. Risk factors: Advanced maternal age. Multiparity. Tetanic uterine contraction. Use of uterine stimulants. Uterine rupture. Cesarean section. Premature separation of placenta. Intra uterine fetal death. Remember: Amniotic fluidenters maternal circulation as a result of breech in the physiological barrier that normally exists between maternal and fetal compartments-so any cause leading to this mixing like cesarean section, premature separation of placenta, rupture uterus etc. Predisposes to amniotic fluid embolism. Most common timing for: Amniotic fluid embolismi. After ARMii. At cesarean sectioniii. In labor with strong uterine contractions. iv. Immediate postpartum.

The patient reports good fetal movement; she has been doing kick counts for the past several days and reports that the baby moves about eight times an hour on average.

        "exp": "Post-term or prolonged pregnancies are those pregnancies that have gone beyond 42 completed weeks of gestation. In general, obstetricians do not allow pregnancies to persist after 42 weeks because of the significantly increased incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality. If a patient has a ripe cervix, it is reasonable to induce the patient at 41 weeks because the chance of having a successful vaginal delivery is very high. On the other hand, if the patient has an unripe cervix, it is generally recommended that she continue with the pregnancy. Alternatively, a patient can be induced at 41 weeks with an unripe cervix if cervical ripening agents are used. If a patient waits until 42 weeks and still has an unripe cervix, then admission with administration of cervical ripening agents prior to Pitocin induction is recommended to improve the likelihood of a successful vaginal delivery. The Bishop score is a way to determine the favorability of the cervix to induction. The elements of the Bishop score include effacement, dilation, station, consistency, and position of the cervix (see table). Induction to active labor is usually successful with a Bishop score of 9 or greater. In the scenario described here, the patient has a Bishop score of 4, which is unfavorable for induction. Therefore, expectant management is a reasonable management plan to try to give the cervix time to ripen to avoid a cesarean section.
