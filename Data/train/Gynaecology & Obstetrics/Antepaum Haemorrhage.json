Placental abruption (32 percent), pre (21 percent), and cervical bleeding (6. 6 percent) were the most frequent causes However, when these are not confirmed, then to suspect fetal bleeding due to Vasa Pre, an APT test is done. Here, the vaginal blood is mixed with Na. OH, and if the hemoglobin gets denatured ( Colorless) then its maternal blood. A positive APT test would indicate that blood is of fetal origin.
