Following delivery, anti-D immune globulin should be given within 72 hours. 40 percent of neonates born to D-negative women are also D negative, so Anti-D given only if newborn is confirmed to be D positive Post-natally, within 72 hours all women who deliver an Rh (D) positive baby should have quantification of feto-maternal haemorrhage to guide the appropriate dose of anti D prophylaxis If immune globulin is missed following delivery, it should be given as soon as the omission is recognized, because there may be some protection up to 28 days postpaum",
