Transvaginal ultrasonography, with or without endometrial fluid instillation (sonohysterography), may be helpful in distinguishing between patients with minimalendometrial tissue whose bleeding is related to perimenopausal anovulation or postmenopausal atrophy and patients with significant amounts of endometrial tissue or polyps who are in need of fuher evaluation. The finding of an endometrial thickness greater than 4 mm, a polypoid endometrial mass, or a collection of fluid within theuterus requires fuher evaluation. Hysteroscopy guided biopsy, if utilized, is the single best investigation for assesment of the uterus",
