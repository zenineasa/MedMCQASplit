        "question": "In laparoscopy, chances of hypercarbia can be reduced by keeping intraperitoneal C02 pressure <_____",
        "exp": "Ans. b (12) (Ref. Novak's Gynecology)INSUFFLATION NEEDLESVirtually all insufflation needles are modifications of the hollow needle designed by Veress. In cases uncomplicated by previous pelvic surgery, the preferred site for insertion is as close as possible to (or within) the umbilicus, where the abdominal wall is the thinnest. When pressed against tissue such as fascia or peritoneum, the spring-loaded blunt obturator is pushed back into the hollow needle, revealing its sharpened end. When the needle enters the peritoneal cavity, the obturator springs back into position, protecting the intraabdominal contents from injury. The handle of the hollow needle allows the attachment of a syringe or tubing for insufflation of the distention gas. 1. A 3-mm incision adequate for the needle is made with a small scalpel, and the abdominal wall is elevated by gripping it in the midline below the umbilicus. Safe insertion of the insufflation needle mandates that the instrument be maintained in a midline, sagittal plane while the operator directs the tip between the iliac vessels, anterior to the sacrum but inferior to the bifurcation of the aorta and the proximal aspect of the vena cava. Therefore, in women of average weight, the insufflation needle is directed at a 45-degree angle to the palienl'-S-SPLine. The needle's shaft is held by the tips of the fingers and steadily but purposefully guided into position only far enough to allow the tip's entry into the peritoneal cavity. The needle should never be forced. 2. In instances in which known or suspected intraabdominal adhesions surround the umbilicus, alternative sites for insufflation needle insertion should be used. These include the pouch of Douglas, the fundus of the uterus, and the left upper quadrant, most often at the left costal margin. The left upper quadrant is preferred if there has been no previous surgery in this area. In most instances, both the insufflation needle, if used, and the primary cannula are inserted through the umbilicus. 3. Before insufflation, the operator should try to detect whether the insufflation needle has been malpositioned in the omentum, mesentery, blood vessels, or hollow organs such as the stomach or bowel. Using a syringe attached to the insufflation needle, blood or gastrointestinal contents may be aspirated. This examination may be facilitated by injecting a small amount of saline into the syringe. If the needle is appropriately positioned, negative intraabdominal pressure is created by lifting the abdominal wall. 4. Additional signs of proper placement may be sought after starting insufflation. The intraabdominal pressure reading should be low, reflecting only systemic resistance to the flow of CO2. Consequently, there should be little deviation from a baseline measurement, generally less than 10 mm Hg. The pressure varies with respiration and is slightly higher in obese patients. The earliest reassuring sign is the loss of liver \"dullness\" over the lateral aspect of the right costal margin. 5. The amount of gas transmitted into the peritoneal cavity should depend on the measured intraperitoneal pressure, not the volume of gas inflated. Intraperitoneal volume capacity varies significantly between individuals. Many surgeons prefer to insufflate to 20 mm Hg for positioning of the cannulas. This level usually provides enough counterpressure against the peritoneum, facilitating trocar introduction and potentially reducing the chance of bowel or posterior abdominal wall and vessel trauma. After placement of the cannulas, the pressure should be dropped to 10 to 12 mm Hg, which essentially eliminates hypercardia or decreased venous return of blood to the heart.",

        "question": "Most commonly performed type of tubal ligation in current practice:",
        "exp": "Ans. a (Pomeroy's method). (Ref. Textbook of Gynecology by Shaw 13th ed. 236)TUBAL STERILIZATIONOperationa) Pomeroys technique: This technique involves grasping and elevating a 2-cm midsegment of tube, ligating the tubal loop with a 2-0 chromic or plain catgut suture, and then excising the distal portion of the loop, b) Parkland method: opening created in mesosalpinx and prox portion of tube is cut. c) Irving procedure: Begins similarly to the Parkland method. However, after the knot on the proximal tubal segment is secured, the ties are left longd) Uchida method: Tubal serosa is first separated from the muscularis by a subserosal injection of a dilute saline solution of epinephrine (1: 100, 000). A longitudinal incision is made in the ballooned serosa on its surface opposite the mesosalpinx. The serosal peritoneum then is grasped and dissected away from the underlying tubal muscularis. Following this dissection, a 5- cm midsegment of dissected fallopian tube is ligated proximally and distally with 2-0 chromic or plain catgut suture, and then resected. The raw serosal edges are reapproximated, burying the proximal cut tubal end within the leaves of the broad ligament and exteriorizing the distal end from the broad ligament. Laparoscopic# Tubal ligation and resection (removal) of a portion of the fallopian tube is the most frequent method of blocking the tubes.# This involves tying a segment of tube and removing it.# There are many variations of this technique.# The tubal ligation procedure described by Dr. Ralph Pomeroy a century ago is most commonly used today. Steps: With the Pomeroy method of tubal ligation, part of the tube is elevated to create a loop or knuckle. An absorbable ligature is tied around the base of the elevated segment, and the tubal segment is cut out. Within a few days, the peritoneum (tissue that lines the organs of the abdominal cavity) grows over and covers the cut ends of the tubal segments. The cut ends of the fallopian tube separate as the ligature dissolves. The peritoneal covering and separation of the remaining tubal segments prevent them from re-attaching to each other. The Pomeroy method of tubal ligation is good if tubal reversal surgery is to be considered later. Approximately two- thirds of women with a Pomeroy tubal ligation become pregnant following tubal ligation reversal. Laparoscopic tubal sterilization methods:# Unipolar coagulation (First method of LTD to achieve widespread use)# Bipolar coagulation (Least failure rate)# Silicone rubber bands (Yoon's clip)# Spring clips (Hulka's clip)# Filshie clip. Modified Pomeroy Method. Many modifications of the Pomeroy technique have been described. One technique creates an avascular window in the mesosalpinx at a midpoint along the tube. Through this window, suture similar to that used for the Pomeroy method is passed. The portion of tube that lies proximal to this window is ligated first. The long ends of this suture then are tied around the entire tubal loop, as in the Pomeroy method. The distal portion of the loop is excised.",

History of previous operation (hysterectomy) and the symptom (Continuous dribbling of urine in the patient) has made it very easy for us to rule out stress incontinence and urge incontinence. Continuous dribbling of urine is a classic feature of urinary fistulas and they are common after gynecological operations. In stress incontinence, dribbling of urine occurs only when intraabdominal pressure is raised. In urge continence, the patient must pass urine at a moment's notice and unless she is quick about it she is unable to control her bladder. Now we are left with 2 options uretherovaginal fistula and vesicovaginal fistula. The passing of urine voluntarily clinches the diagnosis in favor of uretherovaginal fistula as voluntary passing of urine is seen only in ureterovaginal fistula.
