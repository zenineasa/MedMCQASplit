        "exp": "Sedation and wait It is a case of prolonged latent phase of the labour Latent phase of the labour Latent phase of the labour is difficult to define. It stas with onset of painful regular uterine contractions and end when the cervix stas dilating at an active rate. A latent phase exceeding 6 hours in primigravida or 4 hours in multigravida is considered prolonged. Secondary arrest of active phase Active phase of the labour is defined as phase when active cervical dilatation occurs. Secondary arrest of cervical dilatation occurs when cervical dilatation ceases after a normal poion of active phase dilatation. This is believed to be due to cephalopelvic dispropoion. Prolonged latent phase The diagnosis of prolonged labour is made when there is little progress in cervical dilatation for several hours. (In the question the cervix is dilated. for I cm for the last 10 hrs). More common than the diagnosis of prolonged latent phase is the need to differentiate whether a patient is in false labour or in the latent phase. This differentiation may be achieved by continuous observation of the patient for at least 2 hours. Patients in false labour will show a pattern of irregular uterine contractions that eventually decrease in frequency and intensity and there are no cervical changes during the observation periods. Whereas patients in latent phase will show persistent regular uterine contractions that usually increase in intensity and frequency. In addition, patient in latent phase will show some cervical changes. A second method used to differentiate false labour from the latent phase of labour is therapeutic rest. 843 For this purpose the patient is given a 15 mg dose of morphine sulfate. Patients in false labour Sleep for a few hours and awake without contractions. Patietns in latent phase continue with contractions and show cervical changes after the sleeping period. The second most common practical problem related to the latent phase of labour occurs when patients have 3 or 4 cm of cervical dilatation and regular uterine contractions and no progress is observed during the following few hours. These patients may be in a late stage of their latent phase or have an early secondary arrest of dilatation. To distinguish between late latent phase and early secondary arrest it is necessary to take into consideration the patient's parity. - Multipara making little progress at 4 cm of dilatation most likely will be in latent phase. - A nullipara under the same circumstances most likely will be in early secondary arrest. The degree of cervical dilatation is also impoant. - 60% of the patient will be in active phase if the cervix is 4 cm dilated and 90% if it is 5 cm. Finally cervical effacement is a good criterion for recognizing patients in active phase. - Most patients will be in active phase if their cervix is dilated 3 cm or more and 100% effaced - If effacement is 50% or less most likely they are in latent phase. Management There are two modes of management for patients with prolonged latent phase. - Therapeutic rest - Oxytoein stimulation.",

If injury occurs during the passage of the child through the dilated uterine cervix, this injury most frequently involves a tear of the perineum between the vagina and anus. This tear usually involves the pubococcygeus, which is the main pa of the levator ani. The pubococcygeus runs from the pubic bone anteriorly to the coccyx posteriorly, and contains an anterior opening for the urethra and vagina and a posterior opening for the rectum. Tears to this muscle that heal poorly may consequently predispose for uterine prolapse, cystocele, and rectocele. The coccygeus is a relatively small muscle of the pelvic floor that runs from the ischial spine to the inferior end of the sacrum. The iliococcygeus is another pa of the levator ani, and runs from the iliac bone to the coccyx, forming pa of the more lateral aspects of the pelvic floor. The puborectalis is the third pa of the levator ani, and runs from pubic bone to pubic bone, forming a sling-like structure around the wall of the anal canal Ref: Lippincott's Illustrated Q&A Review of Anatomy and Embryology - Page 85",

        "question": "Test for ovarian reserve -",
        "exp": "FSH Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce e. Rg. The ovary is generally thought of as an egg bank from which the woman draws during the reproductive life. During the first few days of each monthly cycle, under the influence of FSH and LH there is rapid growth of several follicles in the ovary. After a week or more of growth one of the follicles begin to outgrow All the others and the remaining. follicles involute (a process called atresia), and these. follicles are said to become atretic. The process of atresia is impoant because it normally allows only one of the follicles to grow large enough, each month, to ovulate. This usually prevents more than one child from developing with each pregnancy. The single. follicle reaches a diameter of 1-1. 5 centimeters at the time of ovulation and is called the mature follicle. With advancing age the capability of the ovan' to produce eggs declines. Methods of assessing ovarian reserve: With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce egg declines i. e. ovarian reserve decrease with age. - Usually age is the best predictor of ovarian reserve but approximately 10% of women have an accelarated loss of ovarian reserve by their mid-30's. - So age alone does not tell the whole story. Consequently more refined methods for predicting ovarian reserve have been developed. The methods for assessing ovarian reserve are classified into two groups:- a). Passive testing b) Dynamic testing The goal of both the approaches is to provide information regarding oocyte (egg) quality and quantity. Passive testing FSH level Early,, follicular phase FSH levels play an impoant role in pregnancy outcomes. As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this adaptive response remains unknown. A rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompained by a decline in oocyte quality. High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy. Generally FSH level are expected to be below 101uhn1in women with reproductive potential - In one study it was found out that 3 day FSH of less than 15 mlu/m1 were twice as likely to conceive than women with FSH values between 15 and 24. 9 mlu/ml. - Cycle day 3 is chosen because at this time the estrogen level is expected to be low, a critical feature as FSH levels are subject to a negative feedback. - Thus any determination of FSH needs to include corresponding estradiol level to indicate that the FSH level was drawn when estrogen level was low. Other methods for passive ovarian reserve testing Measurement of Inhibin B Inhibit B is an ovarian hormone that inhibits FSH release. Although present in ovulating women it is not normally,. found in postmenopausal women. - Low inhibin levels suggests poor ovarian reserve. Transvaginal ultrasound Diminished ovarian reserve means that fewer follicles are available for stimulation and recruitment by feility drugs. Transvaginal ultrasound allows the observation of ovaries and assess the number of follicles (ovarian volume). Dynamic ovarian reserve testing Clomiphene citrate challenge test? Clomiphene is an antiestrogen which inhibits the negative feedback of estrogen on hypothalamus i. e. the hypothalamus gets. false signals that the patient does not have enough estrogen. In response, the hypothalamus induces the pituitary gland to produce more FSH and LH. This is turn initiates. follicular growth to produce estrogen. Clomiphene is able to exe this effect only when the estrogen level is low or the ovarian reserve is low In a normal woman with adequate ovarian reserve there is enough inhibin and estrogen to suppress FSH production through negative feedback and resist the effects clomiphene. - When undergoing clomiphene citrate challenge test, the, first step is to measure day 3 FSH and estrogen. Then 100 mg of clomiphene is administered on cycles day 5 through 9 and FSH and estrogen. measurements are repeated on cycle day 10. In general, a high day 10 FSH suggests poor ovarian reserve.",

Specifically, women with an abrupt onset, typically within several months, or sudden worsening of virilizing signs should prompt concern for a hormone producing ovarian or adrenal tumor. Symptoms may include deepening of voice, frontal balding, severe acne or hirsutism or both, increased muscle mass and clitoromegaly. Accordingly, serum testosterone levels may be used to exclude these tumors. Free testosterone levels are more sensitive than total testosterone levels as an indicator of hyperandrogenism. Although improving, current free testosterone assays lack a uniform laboratory standard. For this reason, total testostrerone levels remain the best approach for excluding a tumor. Threshold values beyond 200 ng /dl of total testosterone warrant evaluation for an ovarian leison. \" So now I do not need to explain that testosterone estimation is the best investigation in case of rapid onset hirsutism and amennorhea. Lines of Leon Speroff further support the answer- \"A serum testosterone concentration greater than 150 mg/dl identifies almost all woman with a potential androgen producing tumor. However, a tumor still should be suspected and excluded in a woman with rapidly progressive hirsutism or signs and symptoms of virilization, even when the serum testosterone concentration is below the threshold value. \" M/C cause of rapid onset hirsutism in young females = Testosterone producing tumor DHEA sulphate is produced exclusively by the adrenal gland. Therefore, serum DHEAS levels above 700 mcg/dl are highly sensitive for the presence of an adrenal neoplasm.

        "exp": "Ans. B: Fetal Attitude Fetal station: This is the relationship between the presenting pa of the baby- the head, shoulder, buttocks, or feet and two pas of the mother's pelvis called the ischial spines. Normally the ischial spines are the narrowest pa of the pelvis. They are a natural measuring point for the delivery progress. If the presenting pa lies above the ischial spines, the station is repoed as a negative number from -1 to -5 (each number is a centimeter). If the presenting pa lies below the ischial spines, the station is repoed as a positive number from +1 to +5. The baby is said to be \"engaged\" in the pelvis when it is even with the ischial spines at 0 station. Fetal lie: This is the relationship between the head to tailbone axis of the fetus and the head to tailbone axis of the mother. If the two are parallel, then the fetus is said to be in a longitudinal lie. If the two are at 90-degree angles to each other, the fetus is said to be in a transverse lie. Nearly all (99. 5%) fetuses are in a longitudinal lie. Fetal attitude: The fetal attitude describes the relationship of the fetus' body pas to one another. The normal fetal attitude is commonly referred to as the fetal position. The head is tucked down to the chest, with arms and legs drawn in towards the center of the chest. Abnormal fetal attitudes may include a head that is extended back or other body pas extended or positioned behind the back. Abnormal fetal attitudes can increase the diameter of the presenting pa as it passes through the pelvis, increasing the difficulty of bih. Fetal presentation: The presenting pa is defined as the pa of the presentation which overlies the internal os. - Cephalic (head-first) presentation: - Cephalic presentation is considered normal and occurs in about 97% of deliveries. There are different types of cephalic presentation, which depend on the fetal attitude. Rarely, the fetus' head is extended back, and the chin, face, or forehead will present first depending on the degree of extension. This is a more difficult delivery, because this is not the smallest pa of the fetus' head. It may result in a need for cesarean delivery. A cesarean delivery may be recommended for any of the fetal positions other than cephalic. Breech presentation: Breech presentation is considered abnormal and occurs about 3% of the time. A complete breech presentation occurs when the buttocks present first, and both the hips and knees are flexed. A frank breech occurs when the hips are flexed so the legs are straight and completely drawn up toward the chest. Other breech positions occur when either the feet or knees come out first. Shoulder presentation: The shoulder, arm, or trunk may present first if the fetus is in a transverse lie. This type of presentation occurs less than 1% of the time. Transverse lie is more common with premature delivery or multiple pregnancies.",

Oogonium is unique in that it is the only female cell in which both X' chromosomes are active. The oogonia proliferate by mitosis to form primary oocytes (diploid cells). Primary oocytes formed from the oogonia enter a prolonged prophase (diplotene stage) of the first meiotic division and remain in this stage until ovulation occurs after pubey. Primary oocytes completes the first meiotic division at pubey just before ovulation to form secondary oocyte (haploid cell) and 1st polor body. Secondary oocyte immediately begins second meiotic division but this division stops at metaphase and is completed only if the mature ovum (ootid) is feilized with sperm. At that time second polor body (polocyte) is extruded and the feilized ovum proceeds to form a new individual. Feilization normally occurs in the ampulla of fallopian tube.",

In developing countries without national guidelines for rubella vaccination, the burden of disease is higher, and CRS affects from 10-90 per 100, 000 live bihs. Common anomalies associated with CRS include deafness (60-75%), eye defects such as cataracts or retinopathy (10-30%), central nervous system anomalies (10-25%), and cardiac malformations (10-20%). Other findings include microcephaly, growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Kleihauer-Betke Test -The sample is maternal peripheral smear and is used to see how much of fetal blood (quantitative) has been transfused into the maternal serum in order to assess the risk of isoimmunization and then the risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn. Both of them relies on the fact that HbF is resistant to alkali (Apt) and acids (Kleihauer) and so the HbA containing RBCs (maternal) will be hemolyzed but not the fetal RBCs as they contain the HbF.

It takes place in the middle segment (ampulla) of fallopian tube. Before feilization, the ovum and sperms reach the ampulla for feilization. Fusion of spermatocyte and ovum leads to formation of zygote. First week of development begins immediately after feilization and includes:? i) Cleavage of zygote: Zygote (feilized ovum) stas dividing immediately and large zygote is subdivided into smaller daughter cells called blastomeres. Blastomeres are still surrounded by zona pellucida. Cleavage occurs in fallopian tube (uterine tube). ii) Formation of morula: At about 16 cells stage the blastomeres tightly align by the process of compaction to form a compact ball of cells called morula (mulberry). This process of compaction leads to segregation of cells into two groups (i) inner cells (inner cell mass), and (ii) outer cells (outer cell mass). Morula enters uterine cavity 4 days after feilization. iii) Formation of blastocyst: As the morula enters the uterine cavity, uterine fluid diffuses through zona pellucida and fills small intercellular gaps between blastomeres, and morula is conveed to blastocyst. Blastocyst consists of:? a) Zona pellucida: Outer covering. b) Embryoblast: A group of centerally located cells of inner cell mass and later give rise to tissues of embryo proper. c) Trophoblast: A thin outer layer of cells formed from outer cells mass and later give rise extraembryonic tissues. d) Blastocele: Cavity of blastocyst: The region of blastocyst containing embryoblast is known as embryonic pole and the opposite pole, the abembryonic pole. The trophoblasts overlying the embryoblast at embryonic pole is called polar trophoblast and that occupying the rest of wall called mural trophoblast. Between 5-6 days after feilization, blastocyst hatches from zona pellucida, and this naked blastocyst is ready for implantation",

Technique of preparing pap smear: A speculum is introduced in the vagina without lubricant and material from cervix is collected using Ayer's spatula. Whole of the squamocolumnar junction has to be scrapped i. e. rotate the spatula through 360deg and spread it on a slide (1s1 slide) and material is also collected from posterior wall of vagina (2\" slide) which acts as a control. The glass slide is not air rie as it gets damaged. The slide is fixed using ethyl alcohol. The main problem with conventional pap smears are that they are of variable thickness and may get obscured by mucus, blood and other debris. This results in cell and nuclear overlap, causing problems with detection and interpretation. To overcome this problem - Liquid based cytology has been developed. Liquid based cytology: Advantages? They decrease the number of false negative results. They decrease the number of inadequate smear collection. Can also be used for HPV typing and testing. Method: From Gynaecology for PG and Practitioners 2/e, p 620 - A plastic sampling device is used to collect the cells in the usual manner but instead of smearing it on a glass slide, the device is rinsed in a buffered methanol solution for transfer to the laboratory.

Pregnenolone is then conveed to testosterone in the testis, to estrogen in the ovary, and to coicosterone and aldosterone in the adrenal gland. The enzymes 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 21-hydroxylase, 11b-hydroxylase, and 18-hydroxylase modify pregnenolone to produce other sex and adrenal steroids. Deficiencies in adrenal 21-hydoxylase can thus lead to inadequate testosterone production in males and produce ambiguous external genitalia. Such children can also exhibit low sodium and high potassium due to deficiency of the more distal steroids, coisol and aldosterone. 5a-reductase conves testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, and its deficiency produces milder degrees of hypogenitalism without salt wasting. Deficiency of the androgen receptor is called testicular feminization, producing normal-looking females who may not seek medical attention until they present with infeility.",

        "question": "Commonest uterine anomaly is: March 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Uterus Bicornis Uterine malformation is the result of an abnormal development of the Mullerian duct. Class I: Mullerian agenesis (absent uterus). - Uterus is not present, vagina only rudimentary or absent. - The condition is also called Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. - The patient with MRKH syndrome will have primary amenorrhoea. Class II: unicornuate uterus (a one-sided uterus). - Only one side of the Mullerian duct forms. - The uterus has a typical \"penis shape\" on imaging systems. Class III: Uterus didelphys (double uterus). - Both Mullerian ducts develop but fail to fuse, thus the patient has a \"double uterus\". - This may be a condition with a double cervix and a vaginal paition (v. i.), or the lower Mullerian system fused into its unpaired condition. Class IV: Bicornuate uterus (uterus with two horns). - Only the upper pa of that pa of the Mullerian system that forms the uterus fails to fuse, thus the caudal pa of the uterus is normal, the cranial pa is bifurcated. - The uterus is \"heart-shaped\". Uterus bicornis unicolis is the most common. Class V: septated uterus (uterine septum or paition). The two Mullerian ducts have fused, but the paition between them is still present, splitting the system into two pas. - With a complete septum the vagina, cervix and the uterus can be paitioned. Usually the septum affects only the cranial pa of the uterus. - MRI is considered the preferred modality due to its multiplanar capabilities as well as its ability to evaluate the uterine contour, junctional zone, and other pelvic anatomy. - A hysterosalpingogram is not considered as useful due to the inability of the technique to evaluate the exterior contour of the uterus and distinguish between a bicornuate and septate uterus. - Class VI: DES uterus. The uterine cavity has a \"T-shape\" as a result of fetal exposure to Diethylstilbestrol. Arcuate uterus where there is a concave dimple in the uterine fundus within the cavity. A rudimentary uterus is a uterine remnant not connected to cervix and vagina and may be found on the other side of an unicornuate uterus.

Genital culture (to look for gonorrhea and chlamydia). An endometrial biopsy (tissue sample removed from the endometrium). Sonogram (if abscesses are suspected). Culdocentesis (fluid sample taken from uterine sac). Laparoscopy are done. Laparoscopy is considered the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis of PID, because it allows visualization of the pelvic organs.

TESA Friends, we have studied in detail IVF and IUI but either of them cannot be performed if appropriate methods for sperm recovery are not available in cases of male infeility. Sperm retrieval or Recovery can be done by: Microsurgical Epididymal Sperm aspiraton: MESAdeg Percutaneous Epididymal Sperm aspiration: PESAdeg Testicular sperm extraction: TESEdeg Percutaneous Testicular sperm fine needle aspiration: TESAdeg (also called as Fine Needle Aspiration FNA). The choice of the method depends on: the underlying diagnosis, whether goal of the procedure is diagnostic or therapeutic whether, isolated sperm will be used immediately or cryopreserved. TESA Is a percutaneous method which requires No/Local anesthesia and retrieves sperms from the testis when spermatogenesis is normal as in cases of post-testicular azoospermia (i. e. either there is congenital absence or obstruction of ', as deferens/ejaculatory ducts or Retrograde ejaculation). MESA Also indicated in cases of post testicular azoospermia. It is done when one need's to know the nature of obstruction or if surgical correction of the obstruction is to be performed at the same time of sperm recovery. (Done under GA/Regional anesthesia). Another advantage of MESA is that a very large number of sperms are usually retrieved so that cryopreservation and avoidance of repeat surgery may be possible PESA Percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration can also be used in cases of Post testicular azoosperma but it is a blind procedure. Bleeding. epididymal injury and postsurgical fibrosis can occur. TESE Indicated in men with testicular azoospermia or Gonadal failure. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection: i. e. ICSI Here a single sperm is injected into the cytoplasm of the oocyte which is then incubated over night. The procedure involves stripping of the aspirated cumulus complex of all surrounding Granulosa cells, so that micromanipulation can be performed on the egg itself. A holding pipette is used to stabilize the egg while an injection pipette is used to inse a ble sperm into the cytoplasm of the egg. Advantage: This procedure bypasses events like capacitation and acrosome reaction by the sperms. Indication: It is indicated in male factor infeiliy: When sperm is count is less than 5 million / ml (severe oligospermia). Absolute indications: asthenospermia i. e. < 5% progressive motility. Teratospermia i. e. < 4% normal sperms. No. of motile sperms is < 0. 5. X106/m1 (as in these conditions IUI cannot be done). If sperms lack acrosome. Abnormal sperm morphology.

GIFT: (Gamete Intra Fallopian Transfer) / ZIFT: (Zygote Intra Fallopian Transfer) They are alternatives to IVF in which oocytes and sperm (in GIFT) or zygote (in ZIFT) are transferred to fallopian tube instead of Uterus laparoscopy.

Polymenorrhea: It is cyclical bleeding which is normal in amount but occurs at frequent intervals (< 21 days). Polymenorrhea occurs in ovulatory bleeding where the ovary goes through its normal cycle but does it more quickly. The acceleration mainly affects the follicular phase of menstrual cycle.

        "question": "A 30 yrs woman 2+0, hypertension have menorrhagia. Which is best treatment for her a. EUR'",
        "exp": "MIRENA [Ref- Dewhurst text book of Gynae & Obs 7/e p. 399-404; A Comprehensive textbook of Ohs & Gynae Saillma Gupta 140, 141, 1421 The question does not give any clue regarding the aetiology of menorrhagia, so most probably the women is having D. U. B. i. e., dysfunctional uterine bleeding. When a woman present with menorrhagia, consideration must first be given to diagnosis. This requires an appropriate history and clinical examination cotnplented by suitable investigation. Anemia should be detected by full blood count and iron studies. Ultrasonography, sonohysterography and hysteroscopy are additional investigations that may diagnose a structural problem and should be utilized depending on their availability and the experience of the surgeon. Common causes of menorrhagia include local pathology such as fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis or infection. Rarer, hut impoant causes include genital malignancy (cervical, endometrial or myometrial) and systemic disorders such as thyroid disease and bleeding disorders. In over 50% cases no cause is found and the diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is made. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding requires the following criteria:- i) Complaint of excessive menstrual blood loss (menorrhgia). ii) Adequate exlusion of pathology that may otherwise cause menorrhagia. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding may be ovulatory or nonovulatory. - Anovulatory cycles results in menorrhagia with regular cycles where as - Ovulatory cycles results in menorrhagia with irregular cycles. Most of the cases of dysfunctional uterine bleeding are secondary to anovulation. - Without ovulation the corpus luteum, fails to. form resulting in no progesterone secretion. - In the absence of progesterone there is no lateral phase or the secretor), phase. - The anovulatory woman is always in the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle and in the proliferative phase of endometrial cycle. - The only ovarian steroidal signal the endometrium receives is through estrogen. - Continuous stimulation of endometrium by estrogen produces proliferation of the endometrium to abnormal levels where it becomes fragile without the growth limiting and organizing effect of progesterone. - The endometrium finally outgrows its blood supply and degenerates. The end result is asynchronous breakdown of the endometrial lining at different levels. We can conclude that bleeding in anovulatory cycle occurs due to unopposed action of estrogen in the absence of progesterone. Anovulatory menstrual cycle gives rise to irregular bleeding. On the other hand, ovulatory cycles give rise to regular menstrual bleeding. These patients ovulate regularly. These patients have both the phases of menstrual cycle i. e.,. follicular phase and the secretory phase. Research has shown that several abnormalities can occur in the endometrium of women with DUB's ovulary cycles for example increased fibrinolytic activity and increased production of prostaglandins. These observation provide the rational basis for treatment in these women i. e., - Antifibrinolytics Trenaximic acid - Prostaglandin inhibitor acid Management of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. In D. U. B's there is no specific abnormality present therefore the choice of t/t must be considered in relation to several factors:? Factors influencing tit -Presence of ovulatory or anovulatory cycles. - Need, for contraception - Patient preference - Contraindication to t/t Heavy periods Require contraception No Regular cycles Yes. L Dysmenorrhoea significant symptoms No. L Tranexanic acid Yes No Yes Combined oral contraceptive or levonorgestral releasing intrauterine system Combined oral contraceptives or cyclical progestins Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs Medical treatment can be conveniently divided into hormonal and nonhormonal:? -As there is no hormonal defect the use of hormonal therapy does not correct an underlying disorder but merely imposes and external control of the cycle. - The two main first line t/t for menorrhagias associated with ovulatory cycles are non hormonal as the ovulatory cycles usually have no defect in menstrual cycle. - They have normal menstruation and regular cycle the abnormality usually lies in increased fibrinolysis and increased production of prostaglandin. First line drugs in ovulatory cycles (menorrhagia with regular cycles) - Antifibrinolytice (Trenaxamic acid) - NSAIDSQ Trenaxamic acid reduces menstrual loss by half and NSAID reduces it by one third. Both have the advantages of only being taken during menstruation, and aid to compliance and are paicularly useful in those women who either do not require contraception or do not wish to use a hormonal therapy. They are also of value in treating excessive menstrual blood loss associated with the use of non hormonal intrauterine contraceptive device. Hormonal therapy Progesterone Traditionally hormonal therapy for menorrhagia has been progesterone given during luteal phase of the cycle. Normally progesterone therapy will control anovulatory bleeding once uterine pathology is excluded. In women who do not ovulate but are more frankly hypogonadal cyclic progesterone therapy restores the normal sequence of steroid hormone stimulation, estrogen followed by estrogen plus progesterone followed by withdrawal bleeding. Progestins are usually not effective. Despite this they remain the first choice of many general practioners and gynaecologists. Progesterones are effective when given for 21 days in each cycle but the side effects are such that patient may not choose to continue with the t/t. Although progestins have contraceptive effect but they are not the best choice when contraception required. Combined contraceptive pill They are popular first line drugs for women who desire contraception. OCP's suppress pituitary gonadotropin release preventing ovulation. Like cyclical progestins they are useful for anovulatory bleeding as they impose a cycle. Levonorgesteral intrauterine system (MIRENA) It is a T shaped intrauterine device which releases levornorgestral at the rate of 20 mcg daily. This low hormone minimizes the systemic progestinic side effects and more patients will continue this therapy than cyclic progesterones. It exes its clinical effect by preventing endometrial proliferation and consequently reduces both the duration of bleeding and the amount of menstrual loss. The levonorgestral releasing system is also advocated as an alternative to surgery. Levonorgestrel-IUD versus surgical treatments A cost-utility model study from Hong Kong repoed that over a period of five years, treatment with the LNG-IUD compared with oral medical treatment, endometrial ablation, or hysterectomy was less expensive and accrued more quality adjusted life years. It is impoant to note that cost-utility calculations may vary in different health care settings. Endometrial ablation Vs Levonorgestrol IVD For women who wish to stop using chronic medical therapy or have contraindications to medications, minimally invasive options include the LNG-IUD or endometrial ablation. A systematic review of six randomized trials and a subsequent randomized trial: found that women with menorrhagia who were treated with either the LNG-IUD or endometrial ablation had similar reductions in menstrual blood loss at 6, 12, and 24 months, as well as similar improvements in quality of life. A meta-analysis of four randomized trials found that rates of dissatisfaction were similar for women treated with the LNG-IUD (17 percent) compared with endometrial ablation (18 percent) (OR 0. 9, 95% CI 0. 5-1. 8). The decision to use the LNG-IUD or endometrial ablation depends upon a patient's preferences regarding treatment factors such as plans: for: feility and contraception, convenience, and risks of anesthesia. - The LNG-IUD is a reversible contraceptive. Pregnancy is contraindicated after endometrial ablation, but the procedure does not prevent pregnancy; thus, women will need to continue to use contraception following ablation. The LNG-IUD can be placed in an office setting for all women and requires no or local anesthesia. Endometrial ablation can also be done in an office by surgeons who are appropriately equipped, but is often performed in an operating room under general anesthesia. If successful, endometrial ablation is performed once, while the LNG-IUD needs to be replaced every live.",

        "exp": "Measurement of rise in basal FSH is an excellent indicator of ovarian aging. As women age serum FSH concentrations in the early follicular phase begins to increase due to a decline in the number of small follicles secreting inhibin. Day 3 FSH concentration greater than 20 to 25 IU/L is considered to be elevated and is associated with poor reproductive outcome. Measurement of serum E2 levels along with serum FSH adds to the predictive power of an isolated FSH determination. Basal E2 concentration greater than 75 to 80 pg/ml are associated with poor response to ovarian stimulation and pregnancy outcome.

Result and interpretation: Under the influence of estrogen on Day12-Day 14 cervical mucus shows characteristic pattern of fern formation. The ferning is due to the presence of sodium chloride in the mucus secreted under estrogen effect. After ovulation on Day 21-23, ferning disappears because protein content increases and Sodium chloride decreases under the effect of progesterone. Disappearance of ferning after ovulation and if previously present its disappearance is presumptive evidence of corpus luteum activity.

The frequency of fetal death and recurrent aboion in untreated patients with antiphospholipid antibodies is greater than 90%. There are several antiphospholipid antibodies. The most relevant to obstetricians are: - The lupus anticoagulant (LAC), - The anticardiolipin antibody and - The antibody that cause false positive syphilis test (BFP-ST). The name lupus anticoagulant was derived from the fact that this antibody was found first in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and acted as an anticoagulant by prolonging the paial thromboplastin time (PTT). This name was a poor choice because soon it was found that lupus anticoagulant was present in many patients who did not have lupus and that in majority of patients the antibody was responsible for episodes of thrombosis, rather than anticoagulation. In the laboratory, LAC is not measured directly. - It is assessed by its effect on PTT and the kaolin clotting time. - Typically patients with lupus anticoagulant have a prolonged PTT and a normal PT. - Unfounately, a normal PTT does not exclude the possibility of LAC, and if the clinical suspicion is strong and the PIT is normal a kaolin clotting time or a dilute Russel viper venom time should be performed. - It has also been found that some patients with LAC and recurrent aboions have elevated values of serum 1gM. Other antiphospholipid antibodies The anticardiolipin antibody is the antiphospholipid antibody, most commonly found in patients with repetitive early pregnancy losses. Anlicardiolipin antibody is found in 90% of patients with L. A. C. but the majority of patients with positive anticardiolipin antibody do not have L. A. C. - Anticardiolipin antibody is measured in the laboratory by the ELISA test. BFP-ST - It is the less common antiphospholipid antibody. - Both BFP-ST and Anticardiolipin antibody, measure the antibody against cardiolipin but they are not the same. Clinical features of antiphospholipid antibodies. The presence of any or several of the three antiphospholipid antibodies is associated with - Recurrent early pregnancy losses. - Episodes of venous and aerial thrombosis - Severe preeclampsia - Chorea gravidarum - Pilo ischemic strokes, transient ischemic episodes, migraine headaches. - Postpaum complications such as pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and cardiac symptoms. Aboions in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome - Typically these patients give a history of a live fetus documented by ultrasound or by Doppler before demise or aboion occurs. The majority of the pregnancy losses occur between 14 and 18 weeks. Fetal death is these patients is caused by extensive thrombosis of the placental vessels and the placenta is usually smaller than expected for the gestational age.",

Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) Hirsutism is defined as excessive growth of androgen dependant sexual hair or male distribution of hair in a female. \"The most common cause of hirsutism is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. \" \"Polycystic ovarian syndrome accounts for 70 - 80% of cases of hirsutism, with idiopathic hirsutism being the second most frequent cause. \" Pathophysiology of Hirsutism: Figure showing effect of androgen on pilosebaceous unit Ted androgen leads to Ted sebum production acne formation. It conves vellus follicles to terminal follicles leading to hirsutism. Under the influence of androgens, terminal hairs that were previously not dependent on androgens reve to a vellus form and balding results. Elevated androgen levels play a major role in determining the type and distribution of hair. Within a hair follicle, testosterone is conveed by the enzyme 5a reductase to dihydrotestosterone (active metabolite). DHT conves sho, soft vellus hair to coarse terminal hair. This conversion is irreversible. Only hairs in androgen - sensitive areas are changed in this manner to terminal hairs. The sites affected are: upper hp - chin side burns - chest lines alba of the lower abdomen Ethinicity and familial tendency also influence hirsutism. Causes of Hirsutism: Remember: Hirsutism is associated with excess androgen production (either from ovaries or adrenals), so any cause which increases androgens causes hirsutism. Most of the testosterone is bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and is considered biologically inactive. Testosterone which is not bound to SHBG is considered biologically active, therefore any factor which decreases",

D: 47, XXY Genetic analysis reveals the karyotype of klinefelter's syndrome to be 47 XXY Klinefelter syndrome/ 46 or 47, XXY/ XXY syndrome It is a condition with an extra X chromosome. Because of the extra chromosome, individuals with the condition are usually referred to as \"XXY Males\", or \"47, XXY Males\" Klinefelter syndrome is the most common sex chromosome disorder in males and the second most common condition caused by the presence of extra chromosomes. The condition exists in roughly 1 out of every 500-650 males but many of these people may not show symptoms. Principal effects include hypogonadism and reduced feility. Turner syndrome/Ullrich-Turner syndrome/Gonadal dysgenesis It encompasses several conditions in human females, of which monosomy X (absence of an entire sex chromosome, the Barr body) is most common. It is a chromosomal abnormality in which all or pa of one of the sex chromosomes is absent (unaffected humans have 46 chromosomes, of which two are sex chromosomes). Normal females have two X chromosomes, but in Turner syndrome, one of those sex chromosomes is missing or has other abnormalities. In some cases, the chromosome is missing in some cells but not others, a condition referred to as mosaicism or 'Turner mosaicism'. Occurring in 1 in 2000 -1 in 5000 phenotypic females. There are characteristic physical abnormalities, such as Sho stature, Broad chest, - Low hairline, - Low-set ears, and - Webbed necks. Girls with Turner syndrome typically experience gonadal dysfunction (non-working ovaries), which results in amenorrhea (absence of menstrual cycle) and sterility. Concurrent health concerns are also frequently present, including congenital heart disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, vision problems, hearing concerns, and many autoimmune diseases. Finally, a specific pattern of cognitive deficits is often observed, with paicular difficulties in visuospatial, mathematical, and memory areas Down syndrome/trisomy 21 Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition characterized by the presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the 21st chromosome, either in whole (trisomy 21) or pa (such as due to translocations). The incidence of Down syndrome is estimated at 1 per 733 bihs It is statistically more common with older parents due to increased mutagenic exposures upon some older parents' reproductive cells. Down syndrome is associated with some impairment of cognitive ability and physical growth, and a paicular set of facial characteristics. Individuals with Down syndrome tend to have a lower-than-average cognitive ability, often ranging from mild to moderate disabilities. The average IQ of children with Down syndrome is around 50, compared to normal children with an IQ of 100. A small number have a severe to high degree of intellectual disability Individuals with Down syndrome may have some or all of the following physical characteristics: - Microgenia (an abnormally small chin), - An unusually round face, macroglossia (protruding or oversized tongue), - An almond shape to the eyes caused by an epicanthic fold of the eyelid, Upslanting palpebral fissures (the separation between the upper and lower eyelids), Shoer limbs, - A single transverse palmar crease (a single instead of a double crease across one or both palms), - Poor muscle tone, and - A larger than normal space between the big and second toes. Health concerns for individuals with Down syndrome include a higher risk for congenital heart defects, gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrent ear infections that may lead to hearing loss, obstructive sleep apnea, thyroid dysfunctions, and obesity.",

        "question": "Which of the following is seen in the ovulatory phase:",
        "exp": "Stimulation of continuation of reduction division of oocytes Ref: Speroff Clinical Gynecologic Endocrinology & Infeility, 7/e chapter 6; Guyton 11/e p1012 The ovarian cycle can be divided into three phases: the follicular phase, ovulation, and the intent phase. The ovarian cycle depends completely on the gonadotropic hormones FSH and LH, secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. During each cycle there is a cyclical increase and decrease of both FSH and LH, as shown in the figure which causes cyclical ovarian changes. The ovaries in a newborn child contain lakhs of primordial follicles (approx 10 to 20 lakhs at the time of bih and no new primordial follicle is formed after bih). Each primordial follicle consists of an oocyte (primary oocyte), surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells. The primary oocyte in primordial follicle is arrested in the diplotene stage of meiotic prophase (of the first meiotic division). Brief review of Ougenesis: Each primary oocyte has a diploid set of chromosomes and must undergo 2 Meiotic divisions: Meiosis 1 and Meiosis II to give rise to an Ovum with a haploid set of chromosomes, necessary for feilization. Primary Oocyte --(Meiosis I) --) First Polar Body (Discarded afterward) + Secondary oocyte -- (Meiosis II)) Secondary Polar Body (Discarded afterward) + Ovum Follicular phase After pubey, in each cycle, when FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary begin to be secreted in significant amount. some of the primordial follicles (approx 6 to 12 in each cycle) begin to grow. In earliest stage of follicular phase the primary oocyte grows in size. The single layer of granulosa cells grow to form additional layers. These follicles are known as primary follicles. During the first few days of each monthly female cycle the concentration of both FSH and LH increase slightly to moderately, with the increase in FSH slightly greater than that of LH and preceeding it by a few days. These hormones especially FSH, cause accelerated growth of 6 to 12 primary follicles each month. Initially there is rapid proliferation of the granulosa cells giving rise to additional layers. In addition cells derived from the ovarian interstitium collect in several layers outside the granulosa cells, giving rise to a second mass of cells- theca. Theca is divided into 2 layers: theca interna which have the ability of secrete additional steroid sex hormones similar to the granulosa cells and theca externa which forms the capsule of the developing follicle. After the early proliferative phase of growth, lasting for a few days, the mass of granulosa cells secrets follicular fluid that contains a high concentration of estrogens. Accumulation of this fluid causes an antrum to appear within the mass of granulosa cells. FSH acts on the granulosa cells to cause secretion of estrogens. This estrogen in turn causes the granulosa cells to form increasing numbers of FSH receptors; this causes a positive feedback effect, making the granulosa cells more sensitive to FSH. The early growth of the primary follicle up to the antral stage is stimulated mainly by FSH alone. Then greatly accelerated growth occurs, leading to still larger follicles called vesicular follicles. This accelerated growth is caused by - positive feedback effect of the estrogens - FSH and estrogens combine to promote LH receptors on the granulosa cells, thus allowing LH stimulation to occur in addition to FSH stimulation and creating an even more rapid increase in the follicular secretion. After the early growth in the follicular phase, one of the follicle begins to outgrow other growing follicle Ida dominant follicle. The remaining 5 to 11 developing follicles undergo atresia. This ensures that only one follicle ruptures to liberate only one ovum for feilization. Ovulation Just before ovulation, ceain changes occur which are necessary for the ovulation. About 2 days before ovulation, the rate of secretion of LH by the anterior pituitary gland is markedly increased rising 6 to 10 folds and peaking about 16 hrs before ovulation (LH surge). FSH also increases about 2 to 3 folds at the same time and both FSH and LH act synergistically to cause rapid increase in the follicle size. The LH acts on the theca and the granulosa cells conveing them mainly to progesterone-secreting cells. Thus the estrogen level begins to fall about I day before ovulation, while progesterone level increases. Progesterone enhances the activity of proteolytic enzymes responsible, together with prostaglandins, for digestion and rupture of the follicular wall leading to ovulation. Luteal phase After expulsion of the ovum from the follicle, the remaining granulosa and theca interna cells change rapidly into lutein cells, under the influence of LH. Total mass of the remaining follicle is now termed corpus luteum. The granulosa cells secrete large amounts of female sex hormone (more progesterone than estrogens). The theca cells secrete mainly the androgens rather than the female sex hormones, but these androgens are conveed by the granulosa cells into the the female hormones. Estrogens in paicular and progesterone to a lesser extent, secreted by the corpus luteum have a strong feedback effect on the anterior pituitary gland to decrease secretions of both LH and FSH. In addition the tutein cells secrete another hormone Inhihin A. This hormone inhibits secretion of FSH by the anterior pituitary gland. Decreasing blood concentrations of both FSH and LH result in degeneration of the corpus luteum. Involution of corpus luteum results in sudden cessation of secretion of estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin A. This removes the inhibitory feedback on the anterior pituitary gland, allowing it to begin the secretion of FSH and LH again which initiate the growth of new group of follicles, thus beginning a new ovarian cycle. The paucity of secretion of progesterone and estrogens by the corpus luteum leads to menstruation by the uterus. In the background of the ovarian cycle now let's see the options given in the question. Continuation of reduction division (meiosis) occurs in the ovulatory phase As already discussed, the primary oocyte is arrested in the prophase stage of meiosis 1. Just before ovulation, the LH surge initiates the continuation of meiosis, giving rise to secondary oocyte and a polar body. The secondary oocyte enters meiosis II but gets arrested in metaphase approx. 3 hrs before ovulation. It is the secondary oocyte which is released at the time of ovulation. Meiosis II is completed only if the oocyte is feilized by a sperm, otherwise the cell degenerates. Inhibin A is increased in the Luteal phase There are 2 forms of inhihin: Inhibin A and Inhibin B Inhibin B is predominantly secreted by the granulosa cells in the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle. Inhibin A secretions begin to rise in the late follicular phase and reach a peak level in the midluteal phase. Inhibin-A, causes suppression of FSH levels during the luteal phase, which contribute to transition from luteal to follicular phase (of the next cycle). The role of Inhibin B is in securing the dominance of the dominant follicle and leading to atresia of the other growing follicles. FSH increases steroid synthesis in granulosa cells FSH acts on the granulosa cells to cause production of female sex hormones- both estrogens and progesterone. Although: production of these steroids are seen in all 3 phases of the ovarian cycle; it occurs mainly in the follicular phase. Activin causes FSH to act on the granulosa cells Activin is one of the peptides secreted by granulosa cells under the influence of FSH. Activin in turn augments FSH action on the granulosa cells and also increases FSH release from the pituitary. Thus it has a positive feedback effect. Role of activin is mainly seen in the follicular phase.",

This is the longest demonstrable length of the embryo or fetus excluding the limbs and the yolk sac. Four fetal parameters routinely measured in the second and third trimester are BPD, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femoral length. In the second trimester, the best parameters for estimating gestational age are biparietal diameter and head circumference. When BPD is altered head circumference has the advantage of being shape independent and can be used as an alternative. Femoral length can also be used and is nearly as accurate as head measurements.

All of you know - contraction stress test \"The contraction stress test (CST) is based on the response of FHR to uterine contractions, with the premise that fetal oxygenation will be worsened. This results in late decelerations in an already suboptimally oxygenated fetus. The test requires 3 contractions in 10 minutes, a positive or abnormal test is when late decelerations occur with more than half of the contractions, suspicious with any late decelerations, and negative with no late decelerations. \" COGDT 10/e, p 255 So here is our answer, the most significant finding for hypoxia is late deceleration. Our answer is further supported by COGDT 10/e, p 257. \"Late decelerations are smooth falls in the FHR begining after the contractions has started and ending after the contractions has ended. They are associated with fetal hypoxemia and potential for perinatal morbidity and mortality. Variable decelerations are abrupt in decline and return to baseline, vary in timing with the contractions, and usually represents cord compression. \" As far as sinusoidal pattern is concerned - Williams Obs. 23/e, p 420 says \"Intrapartum sinusoidal fetal heart patterns were not generally associated with fetal compromise\".",

They however have little or no effect on fetal thyroid function even though they too cross the placenta. \". Williams 23/e, p 1131, 1132 So according to latest editon of Williams, maternal hypothyroidism does not lead to fetal hypothyroidism, thus it does not cause fetal hypoglycemia. Option \u2018c' Rh incompatibility There is no definite correlation between Rhincompatibility and hypoglycemia. Option \u2018d' Macrosomia Macrosomia usually is due to maternal diabetes which inturn results in fetal hyperinsulinemia due to beta cell hyperplasia, which further results in neonatal hypoglycemia.

HPV 6 \"Low Risk HPV types 6 and 11 cause nearly all genital was. \" Details of Genital Was: Genital was are leisons created from productive infection with HPV (most common type 6 and 11). They display various morphologies and appearances ranging from flat papules to the classic verrucous, polyphytic lesions, termed condyloma acuminata\". Sites: External genital was may develop at sites in the lower reproductive tract, urethra, anus, or mouth. Diagnosis: They are typically diagnosed by clinical infection, and biopsy is nor required unless co-existing neoplasia is suspected. HPV serotyping is not required for routine diagnosis. Treatment: - Condyloma acuminata may remain unchanged or resolve spontaneously Effect of treatment on future viral transmission is unclear. However, many women prefer removal, and lesions can be destroyed with sharp or electrosurgical excision, cryotherapy, or laser ablation. In addition, very large. bulky lesions may be managed with cavitational ultrasonic surgical aspiration. Alternatively, 5-percent imiquimod cream is a immunomodulatory topical treatment for genital was. Other topical agents which may be applied for treatment of was are: Podophyllin which is a antimitoric agent available in a 10 to 25% tinctute of benzoin solution and disrupts viral activity by inducing local tissue necrosis. Alternatively, trichloroacetic acid and bichloroacetic acid are proteoplytic agents and are applied serially to was by clinicians. Intralesion injection of interferon is also an effective treatment for was. However as this method has high cost, is painful and is inconvenient to administer, So this therapy is not recommended as a primary modality and is best reserved for recalcirrant cases. Of therapy choice no data suggest the superiority of one treatment. Thus in general treatment should be selected based on clinical circumstances and patient and provider preferences.",

Adolescent patients have no pubic and axillary hair, with otherwise scanty body hair, and lack acne, although breasts are normal as a result of conversion of testosterone to estradiol. Mullerian agenesis is characterized by a failure of the mullerian ducts to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and fallopian tubes and variable malformations of the upper poion of the vagina. An individual with this condition is hormonally normal; that is, they will enter pubey with development of secondary sexual characteristics including thelarche and adrenarche (pubic hair). Gonadal dysgenesis is characterized by a progressive loss ofprimordial germ cells on the developing gonads of an embryo. The accompanying hormonal failure also prevents the development of secondary sex characteristicsin either sex, resulting in a sexually infantile female appearance and infeility. Failure to develop secondary sex characteristics (sexual infantilism) is typical in Turner's syndrome.",

Histopathologically a pa or the full thickness of cervical squamous epithelium is replaced by cells showing varying degree of dysplasia, with intact basement membrane. CIN may be suspected through cytological examination using the Pap smear test or through colposcopic examination. Cervical cytology is the most efficacious and cost-effective method for cancer screening. Final diagnosis of CIN is established by the histopathological examination of a cervical punch biopsy or excision specimen. Additionally, human papilloma virus (HPV) testing can be performed in order to better triage women with early cytologic changes. Cervical Cytology Screening (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Guideline) Initial screening Age 21 or 3 y after vaginal sex Interval Every year Every 2-3 y after age 30 with 3 consecutive normals Discontinue No upper limit of age Comparison of Cytology Classification Systems (in simplified form) Bathesda CIN llysplasia Limit of histologic changes *LSIL CIN 1 Mild Basal 1/3rd of sq. epithelium HSIL ON 2 Moderate Basal 1/2 to 2/3rd CIN3 Severe Whole thickness except one or two superficial layers CIS Whole thickness LSIL - Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion HSIL - High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion CIS - Carcinoma in situ *LSIL incorporates HPV changes (koilocytotic atypia) along with CIN I. Role of HPV HPV infection is found in approx. 90% cases of intraepithelial neoplasia. Type H&18 are most commonly associated. HPV-18 is more specific than HPV-16 for invasive tumors. In most women, the HPV infection clears in 9 to 15 months. Only a minority of women exposed to HPV develop persistent infection that may progress to CIN. Type-16 is the most common HPV type found in women with normal cytology. Treatment CIN 1 Spontaneous regression of CIN 1 is seen in 60% to 85% of cases, typically within 2yrs. So patients who have biopsy diagnoses of C1N 1 are kept under observation with: Pap testing performed at 6 and 12 months Or HPV DNA testing at 12 months After two negative test results or a single negative HPV DNA test, annual screening may be resumed. Women with persistent CIN 1 after 24 months should be treated with a local ablative method. CIN 2 and3 CIN 2&3 carries a much higher probability of progressing to invasive cancer. All CIN 2 and 3 lesions require t reatment. LEEP ( loop electrosurgical excision procedure) is the preferred treatment for CIN 2 and 3. Because all therapeutic modalities carry an inherent recurrence rate of upto 10%. cytologic follow-up at about 3-month intervals for 1 year is necessary. Cryotherapy Considered acceptable therapy when the following criteria are met: - Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 1 to 2 - Small lesion Ectocervical location only - Negative endocervical sample - No endocervical gland involvement on biopsy Laser Ablation It has been used effectively for the treatment of CIN. But because of the expense of the equipment as well as necessity for special training, laser ablation has fallen out of or. Laser has been widely replaced by LEEP. Laser Excisional Conization Rather than using laser for vaporization leading to ablation, it can be used to excise a conization specimen. The ease of LEEP conization has significantly reduced the indications of laser conization. Loop electrosurgical excision( LEEP) LEEP, variably known as simply loop excision or LLETZ (large loop excision of the transformation zone), is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and treatment of CIN. It uses low-voltage, high-frequency, thin wire loop electrodes to perform a targeted removal of a cervical lesion, an excision of the transformation zone, or a cervical conization. This technique can be used in the outpatient setting Cold knife conization (scalpel) Conization is both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure and has the advantage over ablative therapies of providing tissue for fuher evaluation to rule out invasive cancer. Conization is indicated for CIN 2&3 in following conditions: - Limits of the lesion cannot be visualized with colposcopy. - The squat-no-columnar junction (SCE) is not seen at colposcopy. - Endocervical curettage (ECC) histologic findings are positive for CIN 2 or CIN 3. - There is a substantial lack of correlation between cytology, biopsy, and colposcopy results. - Microinvasion is suspected based on biopsy, colposcopy, or cytology results. - The colposcopist is unable to rule out invasive cancer.",

D: Rh positive father, Rh negative mother Rho(D) Immune Globulin is given by intramuscular injection that is used to prevent the immunological condition known as Rhesus disease (or hemolytic disease of newborn) paicularly when father is Rh positive and mother is Rh negative. It is a solution of IgG anti-D (anti-RhD) antibodies that bind to, and lead to the destruction of, fetal Rh D positive red blood cells that have passed from the fetal circulation to the maternal circulation. Therefore, in a Rhesus negative mother it can prevent sensitization of the maternal immune system to Rh D antigens, which can cause rhesus disease in the current or in subsequent pregnancies",
