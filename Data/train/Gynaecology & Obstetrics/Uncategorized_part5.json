Now we are left with 2 options: Hematuria and passage of meconium \"There are no reliable signs of impending uterine rupture that occurs before labor, although the sudden appearance of gross hematuria is suggestive\"... COGDT 10/e p 340. Thus, hematuria can be seen in impending rupture. Though some of you may argue that passage of meconium is a sign of fetal distress, it should not be ruled out but here I would like to say--lets think as a clinician if we have a patient with previous LSCS in whom there is passage of meconium, obviously it will not mean that patient is going to have impending rupture, it means the fetus is in distress which can be due to any reason. Also remember: Spontaneous rupture of uterus during pregnancy occurs in upper segment. Spontaneous non obstructive rupture during labour occurs in upper segment - Fundus. Spontaneous obstructive rupture during labour occurs in lower segment. Most common sign of uterine rupture is non reassuring FHR pattern with variable heart rate decelerations that may evolve into late decelerations.",

The Stockholm system of cervical brachytherapy was the predecessor of modern-day cervical brachytherapy dosimetric systems.

However, most cases show that the first three months in a pregnancy are when most bih defects occur because that is when the organs of the fetus are beginning to form. One common cause is amniotic band syndrome, which occurs when the inner fetal membrane (amnion) ruptures without injury to the outer membrane (chorion).

This condition is called as Deep Transverse Arrest. It occurs more commonly in android pelvis.

Cesarean section If the pelvis is android or there is CPD, cesarean section should be done. In modern obstetrics, traumatic vaginal delivery causing intracranial hemorrhage is to be avoided at all costs and so there is increasing use of cesarean section for deep transverse arrest. Craniotomy If the baby is dead. Note: In most centres now a days, either cesarean section or vaccum extraction is performed, due to lack of experience in forceps rotation and manual rotation. It is extremely impoant to remember that if vaccum or forceps fails, no attempt should be made to persist with vaginal delivery. The procedure should be abandoned and immediate cesarean section undeaken. In late and neglected cases if the fetus is dead, craniotomy is an option in experienced hands. However, now days most obstetricians would prefer to perform cesarean section in cases of obstructed labour, even when the fetus is dead.",

        "exp": "Inversion of uterus?? 'c' i. e., Amniotic fluid embolism The patient went into unexplained shock after postpaum. Both uterine inversion and amniotic fluid embolism can cause unexplained shock. Uterine inversion is more common and impoant cause of unexplained shock than amniotic fluid embolism. Munrokerr's operative obstetrics says \"In all cases of unexplained shock after delivery make a careful vaginal examination to exclude the possibility of occult rupture of the uterus, paial uterine inversion or pelvic hematonza\". Munrokerr fuher adds Uterine inversion is the most impoant cause of unexplained shock Three degrees of inversion are generally described. i) Where the inveed. fundus reaches the internal os ii) Where the whole body of the uterus is inveed upto the internal os. iii) Where uterus, cervix and vagina are completely inveed Symptoms of uterine inversion Symptoms of uterine inversion are not always well defined. If however the inversion occurs quickly or is of severe degree there is. feelling of something coming down and pain followed by collapse and hemorrhage of variable severity. When the inversion is of lesser degree and is contained within the vagina or when the. fundus does not come beyond the os externum, only pain and hemorrhage may be present. Inversion is also the most impoant cause of unexplained shock - In these cases the shock is not primarily due to loss of blood or trauma but is really of neurogenic origin. - In this connection it has been suggested by several authors that as one or both ovaries may be pulled into the invagination, pressure on them may be responsible for shock. - The traction on the infundibulopelvic ligaments, peritoneum and broad ligaments stimulate the \"parasympathetic system\" producing shock. Amniotic fluid embolism may also cause unexplained shock -Amniotic fluid embolism is brought about by the uterine contractions forcing the liquor amni with its contained paicles of meconium, lanugo, and vernix caseosa into a patent uterine sinus from where it is carried into the lungs. - We have opted for uterine inversion as it is the more common cause for unexplained shock. Postpaum collapse from Ian Donald 6/e edited by Renu Mishra Postpaum maternal collapse is serious obstetric complication Majority of these cases occur as hemorrhage that is revealed. But a small minority of cases of collapse after deliver occur without obvious vaginal bleeding but these are the ones that pose a greater challenge. for diagnosis and management. The conzmon causes of postpaum collapse without bleeding are -Eclampsia - Uterine rupture - Vasovagal. syncope - Pulmonary embolism (Amniotic fluid embolism) - Septic shock - Uterine inversion Renu Mishra fuher adds - \"Acute inversion of the uterus should be one of the first possibilities to cross the obstetricians mind in case of unexplained shock\" Amniotic fluid embolism It is a life threatening complication of pregnancy with an extremely high moality rate. 300 The pathogenesis of the condition is not clear. Amniotic fluid probably enter the maternal venous circulation through a breach in the barrier b/w the maternal vasculature and the amniotic fluid most likely from the placental site or at the site of a uterine trauma after the membranes have ruptured. Classically amniotic fluid embolism presents during labour or immediately after the delivery with sudden onset maternal collapse associated with tachyapnea, cyanosis, hypotension, altered mental DIC. So, there is nothing to differentiate between uterine inversion and amniotic fluid embolism in terms of clinical presentation. We have opted for uterine inversion as it seems to be the more impoant and more common cause of unexplained shock. But we are still not sure - A patient with amniotic fluid embolism will always present in this manner i. e., unexplained death following normal de livery. - On the other hand uterine inversion commonly present as life threatening post paum hemorrhage. - It may present as unexplained shock but this is not its usual presentation. - If there is a case of postpaum collapse and no other significant findings are present the first diagnosis that comes to the mind is embolism. - All other causes of postpaum collapse will have some clinical. feature which would point towards to cause. Clinically most of the obstetricianl would suspect amniotic fluid embolism if any other abnormality is absent in case post paum collapse.",

In this case the distal vascular bed is the placental villous tree and hence umbilical artery Doppler is actually a placental and not a fetal Doppler.

Characteristic pathological features of paial mole Chorionic villi of varying sizes with focal hydatiform swelling, cavitation and trophoblastic hyperplasia Marked villous scalloping Prominent stromal trophoblastic inclusions Identifiable embryonic or fetal tissue. Clinical features -- hey generally do not have the dramatic clinical features characteristic of complete pt general these patients have the signs and symptoms of incomplete or missed aboion, and paial mole can be diagnosed after histologic review of tissue obtained by curettage\". Features like hyperemesis, hypehyroidism and Theca lutein cysts are rare in paial mole. Prognosis \"The risk of persistent trophoblastic disease after a paial mole is substancially lower than following a complete molar pregnancy. Moreover, persistent disease is seldom a choriocarcinoma. \" The risk of persistent trophoblastic disease in a case of paial mole is 1-5% wherease with complete mole, it is 15-20% Hence option d i. e. it rarely causes persistent trophoblatic disease is paially correct Diagnosis -- of paial mole by USG is not that easy as is in the case of complete mole because it does not give the characteristic vesicular & ultrasonographic appearance like a complete mole. \"Sonographic features of a paial mole include a thickened, hydropic placenta with fetal tissue. Impoantly, in early pregnancy, sonographv will demon t te the rho raeristic appearance in as few as third of women with a paial mole\"... Williams Obs 23/ed pg-260 Hence Option b i. e. it can be diagnosed very early by USG is incorrect Remember - - The USG criteria for diagnosis of paial mole is Presence of focal cystic areas in the placental tissues. Increase in transverse diameter of gestational sac. The combination of above two criterias have a positive predictive value of 90% for paial moles. (This means USG can diagnose paial mole but not in early pregnancy) The nonble fetus associated with a triploid paial mole typically has multiple malformations, like syndactyly and hydrocephaly and have symmetrical growth retardation. 13 hcg levels > 200 m IU/rni, after evacuation of paial mole in the third through the eighth week are associated with a 35% risk of persistent trophoblastic disease. Extra edge The most significant recent development in the pathological analysis of H. mole is the use of P57kip2 immunostaining to make a definitive diagnosis of androgenetic complete H. Mole as opposed to an hydropic aboion or a paial mole. P57kip2 is a paternally imprinted gene. which is maternally expressed. The absence of maternal genes in androgenetic complete mole means that the gene cannot be expressed in a complete mole cytotrophoblast Hence V kip2 staining is negative in complete mole in contrast to paial moles, hydropic aboion & normal placenta. This technique is well validated, easy and inexpensive to perform.",

Inferior vena caval compression Symptoms of faintness and nausea in lying down position and recovery after turning on the side or getting up in a 26-year old primigravida at 32 weeks of gestation can be attributed to inferior vena caval compression. \"Supine hypotensive syndrome is caused when the inferior vena cava is compressed by the weight of a pregnant female uterus, fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid while lying in the supine position. The condition can develop as early as the second trimester but is maximum during the third trimester. The patient experiences reduced blood pressure signs of shock such as cool, moist and clammy skin, tachycardia (early sign), bradycardia (very late sign), dizziness, syncope or near syncope, pedal edema, nausea, decreased femoral pulse and signs offetal distress. Supine hypotensive syndrome is easily managed by placing the patient in left lateral position Supine Hypotension Syndrome (Postural Hypotension) During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava when the patient is in supine position. Q This, however, results in opening up of collateral circulation by means of paraveebral and azygous veins. In some cases (10%) when collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return to hea is seriously cuailed. Q This results in production of hypotension, tachycardia and syncope.

Q-Tip Test: If a urethra is poorly suppoed, it may display hypermobility during increases in intraabdominal pressures. To assess mobility, a clinician places the soft end of a cotton swab into the urethra to the urethrovesical junction. Failure to inse the swab to this depth typically leads to errors in assessment of urethrovesical junction suppo. Following local anaesthesia, a Valsalva maneuver is prompted, and the swab-excursion angle at rest and with Valsalva maneuver is measured with a goniometer or standard protractor.

Progesterone only pills Mechanism of action of POP's is mainly on cervical mucus - \"All Estrogen free pills except the newer desogesterel pill primarily rely on changes in cervical mucus as they do not inhibit ovulation consistently. \" The cervical mucus effect peaks within 3-4. hours after taking the tablet and lasts for about 22 hours. Hence the next tablet must be taken within 27 hours of the preceeding tablet or else the contraceptive benefit of the cervical mucus effect will decrease and finally subside. Unlike COC's that almost always prevent ovulation, traditional POP's (progesterone only pills) inhibit ovulation in 40-50% of cycles. \"A randomized double blind study, performed over 13 cycles showed that 75 lig desogestrel daily was sufficient to inhibit ovulation in 97% of cycles. Hence for newer POP's containing desogestrel the primary mode of action is inhibition of ovulation\". - FOGSI Focus Jan 06 issue on Modern pill, Chapter Estrogen free pill p 41 Thus, for newer progestational agents main mechanism of action is by inhibition of ovulation.

        "exp": "Histopathology Uterine bleeding in a 45 year old may also occur due to endometrial carcinoma. Transvaginal ultrasound is used to assess the endometrial thickness. Endometrial thickness depends upon the stage of the menstrual cycle. - Immediately after menstruation the endometrium is homogenous, 1-4 mm thick. - As the oestrogen concentration increases, endometrium proliferates and its thickness increases to 7-10 mm. - After ovulation the echogenecity of endometrium increases and it becomes hyperechogenic throughout with a thickness of 8-16 mm. Transvaginal ultrasound is usually the first investigation in case of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. TVS measures endometrial thickness. The exact cut off values for endometrial thickness measurement in premenopausal women to predict endometrial neoplasia are subject to continuing debate. The British \"RCOG\" Guideline development group analysed a number of studies and concluded that 10-12 mm was a reasonable cut off when using TVS preferably undeaken in follicular phase, as a method prior to more invasive procedures of endometrial assessment. In the question, the endometrial thickness is 8mm but the stage of the cycle is not mentioned. The endometrial thickness of the patient does not fulfill the criteria meted out by RCOG but still she should undergo fuher endometrial evaluation as her age is 45 years. Women aged 40 years or more with vaginal bleeding should have an endometrial biopsy to exclude endometrial carcinoma.

Antenatal steroids to promote fetal lung maturity Anti D if patient is Rh negative If uterine contractions are present - tocolytics (magnesium sulphate/nifedipine) can be given as it leads to more advanced gestational age at delivery, greater birth weight of fetus, less neonatal complications, and decreased cost of hospitalization. Tocolytics should not be used for more than 48 hours. Some obstetricians do cervical encirclage in case of placenta previa. The rationale behind the use of cervical cerclage in placenta previa, is that it limits the development of the low uterine segment brought about by advancing gestation and the effect of uterine contraction. But other studies have failed to confirm these findings. Thus, RCOG doesnot recommend the use of cervical cerclage in placenta previa till further data is available",

        "question": "A 19-year-old female comes to the physician because of left lower quadrant pain for 2 months. She states that she first noticed the pain 2 months ago but now it seems to be growing worse. She has had no changes in bowel or bladder function. She has no fevers or chills and no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The pain is intermittent and sometimes feels like a dull pressure. Pelvic examination is significant for a left adnexal mass that is mildly tender. Urine h. CG is negative. Pelvic ultrasound shows a 6 cm complex left adnexal mass with features consistent with a benign cystic teratoma. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "exp": "This patient has a presentation and findings that are most consistent with a benign cystic teratoma. Dermoids are a type of ovarian germ cell tumor. Germ cell tumors are the most common type of ovarian neoplasm in females under the age of 20 and dermoids are the most common benign ovarian neoplasm. Dermoids can range in size from small masses that are noted ncidentally on ultrasound and cause no symptoms, to large cysts that cause pain and pressure, as this patient has. Laparotomy is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient because, as adnexal masses enlarge--especially when they become greater than 5 cm--the risk of ovarian torsion increases. Thus, laparotomy withremoval of the dermoid is indicated to prevent torsion. Also, this patient's mass is causing her symptoms of pain and pressure and, on that basis, should be removeD. Finally, while the mass most likely is a dermoid, this is not ceain without pathologic diagnosis and, therefore, the cyst should be removed and evaluated by a pathologist. At the time of surgery, close examination should be made of the other ovary because dermoids may be found bilaterally in more than 10% of cases. To repeat pelvic examination in 1 year (Choice A)would not be correct management. This patient is symptomatic with a 6 cm ovarian mass that is at risk for torsion. She should, therefore, be managed surgically. To repeat pelvic ultrasound in 6 weekschoice B. is appropriate for some adnexal masses. For example, in a young woman with a small complex cyst that appears consistent with a corpus luteum, it may be most prudent to recheck an ultrasound in 6 weeks to see if the cyst has resolveD. This patient, however, is symptomatic with a 6 cm cyst that appears to be adermoid, which will not resolve spontaneously. She, therefore, requires surgery. To prescribe the oral contraceptive pill (Choice C) may help to prevent future ovarian cysts but it will not resolve this cyst, which requires surgical management.",

        "exp": "Patient D is the lucky mother of identical (monozygotic) twins. The chorion forms before the amnion, so the possible combinations are monoamniotic and monochorionic; diamniotic and monochorionic; and diamniotic and dichorionic (either fused or separated). The first two of these possibilities are seen only in identical twins. However, the latter can be seen either in fraternal or identical twins. Exactly what happens in the case of identical twins depends on the precise point at which twinning occurs: very early separation produces completely separate membranes with duplication of both chorion and amnion; somewhat later separation produces one chorion and two amnions; and very late separation produces one chorion and one amnion. A dichorionic, diamniotic placenta develops if splitting occurs early after feilization, before the chorion forms. This type of placenta may occur with either monozygotic or dizygotic twins. Thus, we are unable to determine whether Patient A or Patient B had identical twins from the examination of the placentas. Patient C did not have a twin pregnancy. A circumvallate placenta has an extrachorial poion outside the inseion of the amniotic membranes, creating a circumferential groove (vallum in Latin). A bipaite placenta is composed of two equal segments. Circumvallate and bipaite placentas are examples of placental abnormalities that usually have no clinical significance. Ref: Cunningham F.

There is a little change in systolic blood pressure, but diastolic pressure is reduced (5-10mm Hg) from about 12-26 weeks. Diastolic pressure increases thereafter to prepregnancy levels by about 36 weeks. The obstruction posed by the uterus on the inferior vena cava and the pressure of fetal presenting pa on the common iliac vein can result in decreased blood return to the hea. This decreases cardiac output, leads to a fall in blood pressure, and causes edema in the lower extremities. Peripheral resistance equals blood pressure divided by cardiac output.

Also Know: Patients are encouraged to use effective contraception during the entire interval of HCG follow up (i. e. atleast for 1 year). Choice of contraception: IUCD: should not be used because of the potential risk of uterine perforation and IUCDs cause irregular uterine bleeding which can be confused with persistent trophoblastic disease.

        "question": "One of the risks of the endometrial biopsy that was performed on this patient is perforation of the uterus. The endometrial biopsy device is placed through the cervix and into the endometrial cavity. If complete perforation occurs, what is the sequence of layers that the biopsy device would penetrate prior to entering the peritoneal cavity?",
        "exp": "The uterus is a hollow, muscular organ that lies between the bladder and the rectum in the true pelvis. The uterus can be divided into three major segments: the uterine fundus, the uterine corpus (or body), and the cervix. The fallopian tubes enter the uterine fundus laterally in the region called the cornua. Moving from the inside (or hollow) poion of the uterus to the peritoneal cavity, the layers that would be penetrated are the endometrium, the myometrium, and the serosa. The endometrium is the poion of the uterus that proliferates during the menstrual cycle and sheds (the menses) if pregnancy does not occur, or suppos the pregnancy if conception and implantation take place. The myometrium is comprised of three layers: an inner layer of longitudinal smooth muscle, a middle layer of circular smooth muscle (the stratum vasculare), and an outer layer of longitudinal and circular smooth muscle (the stratum supervascularae). The final layer is the uterine serosa. The ovary, fallopian tube, and broad ligament are found posterolateral to the uterus. A biopsy device that perforated the uterus could also injure these structures, but the direct path of perforation is through the endometrium, myometrium, and serosa. Note: The round ligament, cardinal ligament, and uterosacral ligament are suppoing structures attached to the uterus. Again, while a perforating biopsy instrument could possibly involve these structures, this would not be the direct path of perforation. The serosa, myometrium, and endometrium are the correct structures that would be perforated, but they are in the wrong order. Staing within the uterus, the first layer is the endometrium, next is the myometrium and finally the serosa. Ref: Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology, 13th Ed Page 7-10",

        "exp": "Ans. is a i. e. Transient tachypnea of the new born Friends don't get shocked by the answer, even I was perplexed when I went through the texts given in all the standard reference books. Let's see what they have said. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or hyaline membrane disease (HMD) RDS almost always occurs in nreterm babies often less than 34 weeks of gestation. It is the commonest cause of respiratory distress in a preterm neonate. According to Ghai -- RDS is seen in preterm babies and not the term babies (as is given in our question). Now let's see what Ghai says about transient tachypnea of newborn: Transient tachypnea of newborn (TTN) Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a benign self-limiting disease occurring usually in term neonates and is due to delayed clearance of lung fluid. These babies have tachypnea with minimal or no respiratory distress. Chest X-ray may show prominent vascular marking and prominent interlobar fissure. Oxygen treatment is often adequate and ventilatory suppo is necessary and prognosis is good. But Ghai didn't mention any correlation between TTN and Diabetes. So, I had to search other books for more information. Neonatal complications: RDS and transient tachypnea are more common in infants of women with poorly controlled diabetics. Respiratory distress: \"Conventional obstetrical teaching through the late 1980s generally held that fetal lung maturation was delayed in diabetic pregnancies. Thus, these infants were at increased risk for respiratory distress (Gluck and Kulovich, 1973). Subsequent observations have challenged this concept, and gestational age rather than ove diabetes is likely the most significant factor associated with neonatal respiratory distress (Berkowitz and colleagues, 1996; Kjos and colleagues. 1990b)\". So, it is the gestational age and not diabetes which is the main factor causing neonatal respiratory distress. In our question the baby is delivered at 40 weeks gestation (Full term) so, the answer can not be Hyaline membrane disease rather it is transient tachypnea of newborn (i. e. option 'a is correct).",

Placenta accreta It is a type of morbidly adherent placenta, where the placenta is firmly adherent to the uterine wall due to paial or total absence of the decidua basalis and the fibrinoid layer (Nitabuch layer). The main aetiology is defective decidua formation. Pathological findings. Absence of decidua basalis. Absence of Nitabuch's fibrinoid layer. Varying degree of penetration of the villi into the muscle bundle. Classification / variants: Placenta accreta - chorionic villi are attached to the superficial myometrium. Placenta increta - villi invade the myometrium. Placenta percreta - villi penetrate the full thickness myometrium up to the serosal layer. Risk factors: An impoant risk factor for placenta accreta is placenta pre in the presence of a uterine scar. Additional repoed risk factors for placenta accreta include maternal age and multiparity, other prior uterine surgery, prior uterine curettage, uterine irradiation, endometrial ablation, Asherman syndrome, uterine leiomyomata, uterine anomalies, hypeensive disorders of pregnancy, and smoking. Other risk factors include low-lying placenta, anterior placenta, congenital or acquired uterine defects (such as uterine septa), leiomyoma, ectopic implantation of placenta (including cornual pregnancy). Pregnant people above 35 years of age who have had a Caesarian section and now have a placenta pre overlying the uterine scar have a 40% chance of placenta accreta. Prior to delivery: presumptive diagnosis made by. Transvaginal sonography - absence of the subplacental sonoluscent zone(which represents the normal decidua basalis) indicates a placenta accrete. Doppler imaging. MRIComplications: Antepaum haemorrhage (due to associated placenta pre). Uterine rupture before labour (due to myometrial invasion by placental villia at the site of previous C- section scar. Postpaum haemorrhage. Infection. Inversion of uterus (rare). Management. In paial morbid adherent placenta In total placenta accreta. Removal of placental tissue in piecemeal. The uterus should be actively contracting. deg (So GA is not used). Oxytocics should be used for this purpose. Hemostasis should be maintained. Complications:- Shock- Infection- Rupture uterus. If female has completed her family Hysterectomy. If female has not completed her family Conservative approach: Cut the umblical cord as high as possible & leave the placenta as such. This is now the most recommended approach.

Munrokar's operative Gynae states \"The practice of this operation has been greatly reduced because of the high fetal moality and because of the danger to the mother of uterine rupture. Earlier it was used in impacted shoulder presentation, placenta pre and cord prolapse, but because of the dangers attached (i. e. uterine rupture) it is now used only for transverse lie encountered with the second fetus of a twin delivery. \" Always remember The patient is deeply anaesthetized while performing internal podalic versioin.",

Candidiasis is a fungal infection common in women of childbearing age that results in pruritus, with a thick, white vaginal discharge. Patients often have a history of recurrent yeast infections or recent antibiotic treatment. Symptoms of candidiasis often begin just before menses. Precipitating factors include immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, and hormone replacement therapy. Candidiasis is usually not contracted from a sexual paner. Seventy-five percent of all women have one episode of candidiasis in their lifetime. Recurrent episodes may indicate underlying immunodeficiency or diabetes. Trichomoniasis is associated with risk factors for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs); elicit a history of multiple sexual paners. The discharge is usually copious, slightly green and frothy, resulting in local pain and irritation. Pruritus might be present. Symptoms often peak just after menses. Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common nonviral STD in the world. Infection during pregnancy has been associated with preterm deliveries and low bih weight infants. Bacterial/ gardnerella vaginosis is asymptomatic in up to 50% of women. If a discharge is present, it is typically a homogeneous grayish white or yellowish white. Bacterial vaginosis is common in pregnant women and is associated with preterm bih. Treating pregnant women that have a history of preterm bih with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis early in pregnancy has been shown to decrease the incidence of preterm bih.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Making endometrium unreceptive There are 2 categories of intrauterine contraceptive devices: Ine and copper -based devices, and Hormonally-based devices that work by releasing a progestogen. Most non-hormonal IUDs have a plastic T-shaped frame that is wound around with pure electrolytic copper wire and/or has copper collars (sleeves). All copper-containing IUDs have a number as pa of their name. This is the surface area of copper (in square millimeters) the IUD provides. Hormonal intra-uterine devices Hormonal uterine devices do not increase bleeding as ine and copper-containing IUDs do. They alter the cervical mucus, makes it thick which prevents penetration of sperm and causes atrophy of the endometrium. Rather, they reduce menstrual bleeding or prevent menstruation altogether, and can be used as a treatment for menorrhagia. Contraindications of IUCD Postpaum between 48 hours and 4 weeks (increased IUD expulsion rate with delayed postpaum inseion) Suspected pregnancy Distoions of the uterine cavity by fibroids or anatomical abnormalities Current PID IUDs may safely be inseed at any time during the menstrual cycle as long as it is reasonably ceain the woman is not pregnant. Inseion may be more comfoable if done midcycle, when the cervix is naturally dilated. Side Effects and Complications The inseion process carries a small, transient increased risk of PID in the first 20 days following inseion. After IUD inseion, Menstrual periods are often heavier, more painful, or both - especially for the first few months after they are inseed. On average, menstrual blood loss increases by 20-50% after inseion of a copper-T IUD. Increased menstrual discomfo is the most common reason for IUCD removal. Complications include expulsion and uterine perforation. The risk of ectopic pregnancy: pregnancies that do occur during IUD use a higher than expected percentage (3-4%) is ectopic.",

Candidates: Suitable for expectant management are: Mother in good health status -- Hemoglobin > 10 gm% -- Hematocrit > 30% Duration of pregnancy less than 37 weeks Active vaginal bleeding is absent Fetal well being is assured by USG and cardiotocography. The expectant management is carried upto 37 weeks of pregnancy until baby matures, Indications for active treatment I contraindications for putting the patient to expectant management.

Down syndrome Friends, before I go into the details of nuchal translucency I want to first explain why I have opted for Down syndrome as the answer and not Turner syndrome, though increased nuchal translucency is seen in both the conditions. My answer is based on the following lines from USG in Obs. & Gynae. by Callen \"Johnson et al showed that simple nuchal translucency between 10 and 14 weeks were associated with a 60% incidence of abnormal karyotypes-mostly trisomy 21. Unlike the second trimester experience, in which large cystic hygromas were most often associated with turner syndrome, the 45X karyotype represented a minority of the karyotypic abnormalities in the group of fetuses with first trimester nuchal translucency thickening. \" Nuchal translucency and its Significance * Nuchal translucency is a thickening of the nuchal soft tissues. Embryos with aneuploidy have an increased amount of fluid in the neck region resulting in increased NT measurement. The maximum thickness of the subcutaneous translucent area between the skin and soft tissue that overlies the fetus spine in the sagittal plane is measured. A cut off of 3mm is used as threshold for an abnormal nuchal translucency in first trimester and 6mm for second trimester (16 - 20 weeks). Best time to assess nuchal translucency in first trimester 10 - 13 weeks. Best approach - Transvaginal (but trans abdominal is also reasonably good). It is best seen in the mid sagittal plane as a sonolucency at the back of fetal neck. Note: Increased nuchal translucency itself is not a fetal abnormality, but rather a marker or soft sign that confers increased risk of fetal abnormality. Causes of Increased nuchal translucency: - Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) - Trisomy 18 - Trisomy 13 -- Turner syndrome -- Klinefelter syndrome -- Triploidy. Nuchal translucency with large cystic hygroma is seen in Turners syndrome. Nuchal translucency with septations carries bad prognosis. Chromosomally normal fetus with increased nuchal translucency is associated with increased risk of: -- Cardiac abnormalitiesdeg -- Diaphragmatic herniadeg -- Anterior abdominal wall defectdeg -- Fetal akinesia/dyskinesia syndromedeg Therefore, ACOG recommends that when nuchal translucency measurement is 3. 5 mm or more with a normal karyotype, then targeted sonographic examination or fetal echocardiography or both should be done. Nuchal translucency of > 3mm in 1st trimester identifies 67% of fetus with trisomy 21. Increased nuchal fold thickness (> 6mm) is the most sensitive and specific single ultrasound marker for the mid trimester detection of down syndrome. Extra Edge: Nuchal translucency is the most impoant sonographic marker of aneuploidy in the first trimester whereas, Nuchal fold thickness (NFT) is the most impoant sonographic marker of aneuploidy in second trimester. NT is measured from external surface of the skull to the internal surface of the skin. NFT is measured from the external surface of occipital bone to the external surface of skin. NFT is useful for screening between 14-23 weeks. Cut off value for NFT is 5mm (above which it is considered abnormal). Note: In the first trimester 2 most reliable ultrasonographic markers for detecting Down syndrome? Increased muscal translucency Absent nasal bone.",

It can be detected as early as 8-9 days following ovulation, doubles every 2 days in pregnancy and maximum levels are reached between 60-70 days of pregnancy (100-200 IU/ ml) Its role is to prevent the disintegration of the corpus luteum of the ovary and thereby maintain progesterone production that is critical for a pregnancy in humans. Early pregnancy testing, in general, is based on the detection or measurement of h. CG. It is an impoant tumor marker. The beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin is secreted also by choriocarcinoma, germ cell tumors, teratoma and islet cell tumor. The lack of a visible fetus on vaginal ultrasound after the beta h. CG levels have reached 1500 IU/ ml is strongly indicative of an ectopic pregnancy. Gestational trophoblastic disease like Hydatidiform moles (\"molar pregnancy\") or Chroiocarcinoma may produce high levels of beta h.

In the second trimester, warfarin is the treatment of choice, with INR monitoring. Warfarin should be given only after the 12th gestational week and should be stopped before delivery around 35th week. At the 36th week of gestation, intravenous heparin should be initiated. To avoid the risk of bleeding during labor and delivery, heparin should be discontinued 24 hours prior. Anticoagulation should then be resumed 4 hours after delivery. Must know: Warfarin has been associated with fetal wastage due to spontaneous aboion and stillbihs, optic nerve atrophy and blindness, microcephaly, mental retardation, and even death due to intracranial hemorrhage. Its use in the first trimester is associated with warfarin embryopathy in 4-10% of newborns, a syndrome comprising nasal bone hypoplasia and epiphyseal stippling. Breast-feeding women can be prescribed warfarin because it is not secreted in the breast milk.

Low forceps: The leading point of the fetal skull is at a station greater than or equal to +2 cm and is not on the pelvic floor; any degree of rotation may be present. Mid forceps: The station is above +2 cm, but the head is engaged. High forceps: Previous systems classified high-forceps deliveries as procedures performed when the head is not engaged. High-forceps deliveries are not recommended. The following indications apply to use of forceps, when no contraindications exist: Prolonged second stage: This includes nulliparous woman with failure to deliver after 2 hours without, and 3 hours with, conduction anesthesia. It also includes multiparous woman with failure to deliver after 1 hour without, and 2 hours with, conduction anesthesia. Suspicion of immediate or potential fetal compromise in the second stage of labor. Shoening of the second stage for maternal benefits: Maternal indications include, but are not limited to, exhaustion, bleeding, cardiac or pulmonary disease, and history of spontaneous pneumothorax. In skilled hands, fetal malpositions, including the after-coming head in breech vaginal delivery, can be indications for forceps delivery. Prerequisites for forceps delivery include the following: The head must be engaged. The cervix must be fully dilated and retracted. The position of the head must be known. Clinical assessment of pelvic capacity should be performed. No dispropoion should be suspected between the size of the head and the size of the pelvic inlet and mid pelvis. The membranes must be ruptured. The patient must have adequate analgesia. The operator should be competent in the use of the instruments",

        "exp": "The condition described is a complete hydatidiform mole. Hydatidiform mole is a spectrum of conditions due to abnormal proliferation of trophoblast and ranging from entirely benign conditions (complete and paial mole) to very aggressive neoplasms (choriocarcinoma). Paial moles have a triploid karyotype (69, XXY) and derive from feilization of an ovum with one or two sperm; fetal pas are frequently seen. Complete moles have a diploid karyotype (46, XX or 46, XY) and derive from feilization of an empty ovum by a single sperm (androgenesis); no fetal pas are found. Ten percent of moles acquire a more aggressive behavior and invade deeper pas of the myometrium, degenerating into invasive moles. Two percent of complete moles may transform into choriocarcinoma, a very aggressive neoplasm that spreads rapidly through the bloodstream. Founately, choriocarcinomas of placental origin are highly responsive to chemotherapy, affording up to 100% cure or remission. Nongestational choriocarcinoma, in contrast, is poorly responsive to chemotherapy. Remember the following impoant points: Complete mole, usually diploid karyotype: results from androgenesis (sperm feilization of an empty egg), no fetal pas are identified, 2% progress to choriocarcinoma.

Prolactin inhibits luteinizing hormone (LH) but has no effect on follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). However, it partially inhibits ovarian respons to both of these gonadotropins. As a result, while the prolactin level remains high, the ovary produces little estrogen and no progesterone. Hence, ovulation and menstruation are affected. \u2022 LAM is effective only till 6 months postpartum.

Misoprostol is more effective in staing labor than other drugs used for labor induction. It is also significantly less expensive than the other commonly used agents. Misoprostol is one of the drugs used for medical aboions in lieu of surgical evacuation. The advantages of medical aboion over surgical aboion include reduced invasiveness of the procedure, lack of risks from general anesthesia (which is often used for surgical aboions), and lack of risk of secondary infeility due to scarring and intrauterine adhesions (Asherman's Syndrome). Misoprostol can also be used to dilate the cervix in preparation for a surgical aboion, paicularly in the second trimester (either alone or in combination with laminaria stents). Misoprostol is sometimes used to treat early fetal death in the absence of spontaneous miscarriage. Misoprostol is also used to prevent and treat post-paum hemorrhage, but it has more side effects and is less effective than oxytocin for this purpose.",

Tenderness in uterine palpation Complete rupture: Sense of something giving away Collapse, shock, dehydration Absent FHS Palpation of superficial pas Shoening of cord immediately following a difficult vaginal delivery is pathognomonic of uterine rupture. So it is clear that fetal distress and vaginal bleeding may be seen in impending uterine rupture. Now we are left with 2 options: Hematuria and passage of meconium \"There are no reliable signs of impending uterine rupture that occurs hpfnre labor, although the sudden appearance of gross hematuria is suggestive\"... COGDT 10/e p 340. Thus. hematuria can be seen in impending rupture. Though some of you may argue that passage of meconium is a sign of fetal distress, it should not be ruled out but here I would like to say--lets think as a clinician if we have a patient with previous LSCS in whom there is passage of meconium, obviously it will not mean that patient is going to have impending rupture. it means the fetus is in distress which can be due to any reason. Also remember: Spontaneous rupture of uterus during pregnancy occurs in upper segment. Spontaneous non obstructive rupture during labour occurs in upper segment - Fundus. Spontaneous obstructive rupture during labour occurs in lower segment. Most common sign of uterine rupture is non reassuring FHR pattern with variable heart rate decelerations that may evolve into late decelerations.
