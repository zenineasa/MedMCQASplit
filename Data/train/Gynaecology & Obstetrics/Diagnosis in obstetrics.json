PL has anti-insulin properties. h. PL is a hormone secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast during pregnancy. Like human growth hormone, h. PL is encoded by genes on chromosome 17q22-24. HPL is present only during pregnancy, with maternal serum levels rising in relation to the growth of the fetus and placenta. Maximum levels are reached near term, typically to 5-7 mg/L.

Methods of Monitoring Fetal Heart Rate Fetal stethoscope (Pinard) & Hand-held Doppler (Sonicaid) Cardiotocograph (CTG) Cardiotocography (CTG) CTG: Technical means of recording (-graphy) fetal heartbeat (cardio-) & uterine contractions (-toco-) during pregnancy, typically in third trimester. The machine used to perform the monitoring is called a Cardiotocograph, more commonly known as an Electronic Fetal Monitor (EFM). Two separate transducers perform recordings, one for the measurement of fetal heart rate & second one for uterine contractions. Types of measurement: Each of the transducers may be either external or internal. External measurement means taping or strapping the two sensors to the abdominal wall. This is called an indirect measure. Internal measurement (direct) requires a certain degree of cervical dilatation, as it involves insetting a pressure catheter into the uterine cavity, as well as attaching a scalp electrode to the childs head to adequately measure the electric activity of the fetal heart. Interpretation: Includes description of uterine activity (contractions), baseline fetal heart rate, baseline FHR variability, presence of accelerations, periodic or episodic decelerations The 3 primary mechanisms by which uterine contractions can cause a decrease in fetal heart rate are compression of fetal head, umbilical cord & uterine myometrial vesselsQ. Variability Baseline variability refers to the variation of fetal heart rate from one beat to the next. Variability occurs as a result of the interaction between nervous system, chemoreceptors. baroreptors & cardiac responsiveness. This is because a healthy foetus will constantly be adapting it's heart rate to respond to changes in it's environment. Normal variability is between 10-25 bpm To calculate variability you look at how much the peaks & troughs of the heart rate deviate from baseline rate (in bpm) Variability can be categorised as: Reassuring > 5 bpmQ Non-reassuring <5 bpm for between 40-90 minutesQ Abnormal <5 bpm for >90 minutesQ Accelerations Abrupt increase in baseline heart rate of >15 bpm for >15 secondsQ The presence of accelerations is reassuring Antenatally there should be at least 2 accelerations every 15 minutesQ Accelerations occurring alongside uterine contractions is a sign of a healthy foetusQ Decelerations Decelerations: Abrupt decrease in baseline heart rate of >15 bpm for > 15 seconds Types of deceleration Early deceleration * Start when uterine contraction begins & recover when uterine contraction stops * Due to increased foetal intracranial pressure causing increased vagal tone * Resolves once the uterine contraction ends & intracranial pressure reduces * Considered to be physiological & not pathological Variable deceleration * Seen as a rapid fall in baseline rate with a variable recovery phase * Variable in their duration & may not have any relationship to uterine contractions * Seen during labour & in patients with reduced amniotic fluid volume * Variable decelerations are usually caused by umbilical cord compression * The umbilical vein is often occluded first causing an acceleration in response * Then the umbilical artery is occluded causing a subsequent rapid deceleration * When pressure on the cord is reduced another acceleration occurs & then the baseline rate returns * Accelerations before & after a variable deceleration are known as the \"shoulders of deceleration\" * Variable decelerations can sometimes resolve if the mother changes position * The presence of persistent variable decelerations indicates the need for close monitoring Late deceleration * Begin at the peak of uterine contraction & recover after the contraction ends. * Indicates there is insufficient blood flow through the uterus & placenta, foetal hypoxia & acidosis due to reduced uteroplacental blood flow. * If foetal blood pH is acidotic it indicates significant foetal hypoxia & the need for emergency C-section Prolonged deceleration * A deceleration that last more than 2 minutes * If it lasts between 2-3 minutes it is classed as non-reassuring * It it lasts longer than 3 minutes it is immediately classed as abnormal * Action must be taken quickly, e. g.. Foetal blood sampling/emergency C-section Sinusoidal Pattern A smooth, regular, wave-like pattern, frequency of around 2-5 cycles a minute, stable baseline rate around 120-160 bpm, no beat to beat variability It indicates severe foetal hypoxia, severe foetal anemia, foetal/ maternal haemorrhageQ Management: Immediate C-section is indicated for this kind of pattern. Significance: This type of pattern is rare, however if present it is very serious, it is associated with high rates of foetal morbidity & mortality. Outcome is usually poor.",

In the options we have Down syndrome as well trisomy 18 as, discussed in preceding text, in both these conditions NT is raised still the better option is Down syndrome. My answer is based on the following lines from USG in Obs. and Gynae by Callen. \"Johnson et al showed that simple nuchal translucency between 10 and 14 weeks were associated with a 60% incidence of abnormal karyotypes-mostly trisomy 21. Unlike the second trimester experience, in which large cystic hygromas were most often associated with Turner syndrome, the 45X karyotype represented a minority of the karyotype abnormalities in the group of fetuses with first trimester nuchal translucency thickening. Remember: Nuchal translucency (NT) is a sonographic marker of Down syndrome/aneuploidy in first trimester whereas nuchal fold thickness (NFT > 5 mm) is the most important sonographic marker of aneuploidy in the second trimester. Absent nasal bone is another marker of Down syndrome in 1st trimester. Nasal bone is absent in 68. 8% of fetuses with Down syndrome.",

After 34 weeks, it falls below 1. 0. If the fetus is affected by asymmetric IUGR, the HC remains larger. The HC/AC is then elevated. In symmetric IUGR, both the HC and AC are reduced. The HC/AC ratio remains normal. Using HC/AC ratio, 85% of IUGR fetuses are detected. Transcerebellar diameter correlates well with the gestational age. AC is the single most sensitive parameter to detect IUGR. * Femur length (FL) is not affected in asymmetric IUGR. The FL/AC ratio is 22 at all gestational ages from 21 weeks to term. FL/AC ratio greater than 23. 5 suggests IUGR. * Amniotic fluid volume--The reduced amniotic fluid volume is often associated with asymmetrical IUGR.

        "exp": "Ans. A. Crown - rump length. The most sensitive indicator of symmetric and asymmetric IUGR is the abdominal circumference, which has a sensitivity of over 95 percent if the measurement is below the 2. 5th percentile. Head/abdomen ratio is very useful in suspected IUGR when sparing head growth is observed (asymmetrical IUGR) and ratio is increased. Between 20 and 36 weeks of gestation, the HC/AC ratio normally drops almost linearly from 1. 2 to 1. 0. The ratio is normal in the fetus with symmetric growth restriction and elevated in the infant with asymmetric growth restriction. 1. First trimestercrown-rump length is most accurate. The image should be obtained in a sagittal plane and include neither the yolk sac nor a limb bud. If carefully performed, it has a variation of only 3 to 5 days. 2. Second trimester. Between 14 and 26 weeks, the biparietal diameter (BPD) is usually the most accurate parameter, with a variation of 7 to 10 days. By convention, the BPD is measured from the outer edge of the proximal skull to the inner edge of the distal skull, at the level of the thalami and cavum Septi pellucidi. The head circumference (HC) also is measured. If the head shape is flattened (dolichocephaly) or rounded (brachycephaly), this measurement is more reliable than the BPD. The femur length (FL) correlates well with both BPD and gestational age. The femur is measured with the beam perpendicular to the long axis of the shaft, excluding the epiphysis, and has a variation of 7 to 11 days in the second trimester. The abdominal circumference (AC) is the parameter with the widest variation of 2 to 3 weeks. This is because the AC measurement involves soft tissue rather than bone and is also the parameter most affected by fetal growth. The AC is measured at the skin line in a transverse view of the fetus at the level of the fetal stomach and umbilical vein. 3. Third trimester. The variability of gestational age estimation increases as pregnancy advances. By the third trimester, all individual measurements become less accurate. Estimates are improved by taking an average of the various parameters the BPD, HC, AC, and FL. Also, each measurement should be assessed individually; if one measurement is significantly different from the others, it can be excluded from the calculation. The outlier measurement could result from poor visibility, or it could indicate a fetal growth abnormality. If third-trimester ultrasound measurements must be used to determine gestational age, accuracy can be improved by performing serial examinations and documenting normal interval fetal growth",
