        "exp": "The first investigation for abnormal uterine bleeding is Urine Beta HCG to rule ouut pregnancy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding(AUB): is a common and debilitating condition. Chronic AUB was defined as &; bleeding from the uterine corpus that is abnormal in volume, regularity and/or timing that has been present for the majority of the last 6 months. AUB may affect females of all ages. Factors that influence incidence most greatly are age and reproductive status. A structured approach for establishing the cause using the FIGO PALM COEIN classification system will facilitate accurate diagnosis and inform treatment options. In the reproductive age group, the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis matures, and anovulatory uterine bleeding is encountered less often. The diagnostic goal is exclusion of pregnancy and identification of the underlying pathology to allow optimal treatment. Miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and hydatidiform moles may cause life-threatening hemorrhage. Pregnancy complications are quickly excluded with determination of urine and serum Beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (h. CG levels). This is typically obtained on all reproductive-aged women. Other options: Pap smear evaluation is usually done for cervical and endometrial cancers which are commonly seen in peri and post menopausal women. Transvaginal sonography (TVS) typically offers greater patient comfo and suitable detection of postmenopausal endometrial hyperplasia and cancer compared to transabdominal ultrasonography.

It affects more than 50% of post-pubescent women in the age group of 18 to 25 years, with ovulatory cycles. Secondary dysmenorrhoea: It is associated with the presence of organic pelvic pathologies such as fibroids, adenomyosis, PID and endometriosis Unilateral dysmenorrhoea can be seen in a rudimentary horn of bicornuate uterus, IUCD users, and cervical stenosis. B. Clinical: Spasmodic dysmenorrhoea: It is the most prevalent and manifests as cramping pain, right before or at the sta of the menstrual period, and is most pronounced on the first and second days of menstruation Congestive dysmenorrhoea: It present as increasing pelvic discomfo and pelvic pain, a few days before menses begin. Thereafter, the patient experiences rapid relief of the symptoms. This variety is commonly seen in PID. IUCD users, varicosities of pelvic vein, pelvic veins, pelvic endometriosis, and fibroids. Membranous dysmenorrhoea: It is a special group, in which the endometrium is shed as a cast at the time of menstruation. The passage of the cast is associated with painful uterine cramps.

The test is considered positive if the patient responds to the administration of oral tablet medroxyprogesterone (Provera/Modus/Deviry) 10 mg daily for 5 days or injection progesterone in oil 100 mg intramuscularly or primolut-N 5 mg three times a day for 3 days. Withdrawal bleeding occurs within 2-7 days. A positive test indicates amenorrhoea secondary to anovulation. The common underlying causes are hypothalamic dysfunction and polycystic ovary syndrome. Negative test requires giving oestradiol 0. 02 mg or conjugated oestrogen 1. 25 mg for 25 days and progestogen from 16th to 25th day. Negative test suggests endometrial unresponsiveness in the presence of normal FSH. Reference: Shaw's Textbook of Gnaecology 16th edition page no 330",

Ovaries containing follicle cysts may be a source of increased estrogen production, paicularly during the postmenopausal years, when gonadotropin levels are very high. The increase in estrogen production that is characteristic of PCOD is the consequence of the peripheral conversion of androstenedione to estrogen, not of direct gonadal production. During the third trimester of pregnancy estrogen production is increased because of the formation of estrogen by the placenta rather than by the ovary. Arrhenoblastoma is a virilizing ovarian tumor and does not secrete estrogen. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia causes virilization due to the increased adrenal output of androgens.",

        "exp": "The patient most likely has a delayed onset of pubey rather than a destructive lesion in the hypothalamic/pituitary axis, a primary disease involving the ovaries or a problem involving the end-organs (e. g., imperforate hymen). Note that she has normal secondary sex characteristics indicating the presence of estrogen. She had withdrawal bleeding after being given progesterone, which proves that the endometrial mucosa has already been primed with estrogen. In addition, a normal menstrual flow implies the absence of an end organ defect preventing menses from occurring. Primary amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstruation by age 16 years. As a general rule, amenorrhea is the hallmark for hypogonadism, assuming that no end-organ abnormalities are present. As with secondary amenorrhea, primary amenorrhea is subdivided on the basis of gonadotropin levels (follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone ). Amenorrhea in the presence of elevated gonadotropins is designated as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (primary ovarian disease), while reduced gonadotropin levels is called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (hypothalamic/pituitary disease). Normal levels of FSH and LH in the presence of normal secondary sex characteristics usually indicate an end-organ abnormality. The absence of secondary sex characteristics by age 16 years is always a more significant finding than having a patient with normal secondary sex characteristics. In addition to ordering gonadotropin levels, a progesterone challenge is an excellent test to perform in the initial evaluation of these patients. The absence of menses confirms that there is a problem, but it does not differentiate among the three main areas previously cited. Withdrawal bleeding indicates that the endometrial mucosa must have been primed with estrogen, so the hypothalamic/pituitary axis and ovaries must be normal. This test also rules out an end-organ defect. The following cha (paial list) provides a classification for these subdivisions of primary amenorrhea.",

Menorrhagia denotes regularly timed episodes of bleeding that are excessive in amount (>80mL) and/or duration of flow (>7 days) According to the recent update, the term heavy menstrual bleeding has replaced menorrhagia. Hemoglobin concentration below 12 g/dL increase the chance of identifying women with heavy menstrual bleeding. A normal level, however, doesnot exclude heavy menstrual bleeding, as many women with clinically significant bleeding have normal values. All patients should undergo a pelvic examination and, if the menstrual pattern has changed substantially or if anemia is present, a vaginal sonography should be carried out as the most impoant supplemental examination. Vaginal sonography combined with an endometrial biopsy is a reliable method for diagnosing endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, but it is insufficient for diagnosing endometrial polyps and fibroids; these can be diagnosed more reliably by sonohysterography or hysteroscopy. Appropriate treatment considerably improves the quality of life of the patients. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tranexamic acid reduce menstrual blood loss by 20-60% Drug treatment should be used and evaluated before surgical interventions are considered.
