        "exp": "The first investigation for abnormal uterine bleeding is Urine Beta HCG to rule ouut pregnancy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding(AUB): is a common and debilitating condition. Chronic AUB was defined as &; bleeding from the uterine corpus that is abnormal in volume, regularity and/or timing that has been present for the majority of the last 6 months. AUB may affect females of all ages. Factors that influence incidence most greatly are age and reproductive status. A structured approach for establishing the cause using the FIGO PALM COEIN classification system will facilitate accurate diagnosis and inform treatment options. In the reproductive age group, the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis matures, and anovulatory uterine bleeding is encountered less often. The diagnostic goal is exclusion of pregnancy and identification of the underlying pathology to allow optimal treatment. Miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and hydatidiform moles may cause life-threatening hemorrhage. Pregnancy complications are quickly excluded with determination of urine and serum Beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (h. CG levels). This is typically obtained on all reproductive-aged women. Other options: Pap smear evaluation is usually done for cervical and endometrial cancers which are commonly seen in peri and post menopausal women. Transvaginal sonography (TVS) typically offers greater patient comfo and suitable detection of postmenopausal endometrial hyperplasia and cancer compared to transabdominal ultrasonography.

Ovaries containing follicle cysts may be a source of increased estrogen production, paicularly during the postmenopausal years, when gonadotropin levels are very high. The increase in estrogen production that is characteristic of PCOD is the consequence of the peripheral conversion of androstenedione to estrogen, not of direct gonadal production. During the third trimester of pregnancy estrogen production is increased because of the formation of estrogen by the placenta rather than by the ovary. Arrhenoblastoma is a virilizing ovarian tumor and does not secrete estrogen. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia causes virilization due to the increased adrenal output of androgens.",

        "exp": "The patient most likely has a delayed onset of pubey rather than a destructive lesion in the hypothalamic/pituitary axis, a primary disease involving the ovaries or a problem involving the end-organs (e. g., imperforate hymen). Note that she has normal secondary sex characteristics indicating the presence of estrogen. She had withdrawal bleeding after being given progesterone, which proves that the endometrial mucosa has already been primed with estrogen. In addition, a normal menstrual flow implies the absence of an end organ defect preventing menses from occurring. Primary amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstruation by age 16 years. As a general rule, amenorrhea is the hallmark for hypogonadism, assuming that no end-organ abnormalities are present. As with secondary amenorrhea, primary amenorrhea is subdivided on the basis of gonadotropin levels (follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone ). Amenorrhea in the presence of elevated gonadotropins is designated as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (primary ovarian disease), while reduced gonadotropin levels is called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (hypothalamic/pituitary disease). Normal levels of FSH and LH in the presence of normal secondary sex characteristics usually indicate an end-organ abnormality. The absence of secondary sex characteristics by age 16 years is always a more significant finding than having a patient with normal secondary sex characteristics. In addition to ordering gonadotropin levels, a progesterone challenge is an excellent test to perform in the initial evaluation of these patients. The absence of menses confirms that there is a problem, but it does not differentiate among the three main areas previously cited. Withdrawal bleeding indicates that the endometrial mucosa must have been primed with estrogen, so the hypothalamic/pituitary axis and ovaries must be normal. This test also rules out an end-organ defect. The following cha (paial list) provides a classification for these subdivisions of primary amenorrhea.",

Typical symptoms are continuous painless vaginal bleeding at the onset of mensus, or preceeded by a 6-8 week period of amenorrhoea. Occasionally the woman gives a history of menorrhagia prior to this. The uterus is slightly bulky, uniformly enlarged and the uterine wall shows a mild degree of myohyperplasia, measuring upto 2. 5 cm. The endometrium is thick, polypoidal and thin slender poplyps project into the uterine cavity. The endometrium shows characteristic cystic glandular hyperplasia, which appears as a swiss cheese pattern. The second feature is the absence of secretory endometrium i. e., absence of cork screw glands (as the bleeding is anovulatory,, there is no progesterone and hence no secretory changes in the endometrium) Corpus luteum is absent and one or both ovaries may contain a cyst, not larger than 5 cm.

Patients with Swyer syndrome generally present after the expected time of pubey with delayed sexual maturation, primary amenorrhea, normal pubic hair, and normal female internal and external genital anatomy. Evaluation reveals hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, prompting a karyotype that establishes the diagnosis. Gonadectomy is indicated soon after diagnosis due to the significant risk for development of germ cell tumours in occult testicular elements (20-30%).

As there is no ovulation, endometrium is under the influence of estrogen without being opposed by growth limiting progesterone for prolonged period. After the variable period, estrogen level falls resulting in endometrail shedding with heavy bleeding. First line of treatment is medical therapy. progesterone are the main hormones used in DUB in all age groups. Common preparations used are Norethisterone and medoxyprogesterone acetate.
