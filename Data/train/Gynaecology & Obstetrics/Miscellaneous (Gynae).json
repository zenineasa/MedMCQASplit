There are two methods of emergency contraception:# emergency contraception pills (ECPs)# copper-bearing intrauterine devices (IUDs). When inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse, a copper-bearing IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception available. The emergency contraceptive pill regimen recommended by WHO is one dose of levonorgestrel 1. 5 mg, taken within five days (120 hours) of unprotected intercourse. 1. Emergency contraception pills# WHO recommends levonorgestrel for emergency contraceptive pill use. Ideally, this progestogen-only method should be taken as a single dose (1. 5 mg) within five days (120 hours) of unprotected intercourse. Alternatively, a woman can take the levonorgestrel in two doses (0. 75 mg each; 12 hours apart).# Mode of action: Levonorgestrel emergency pills prevent pregnancy by preventing or delaying ovulation. They may also prevent fertilization of an egg by affecting the cervical mucus or the ability of sperm to bind to the egg. They are not effective once the process of implantation has begun.# Effectiveness: levonorgestrel regimen is 52-94% effective in preventing pregnancy. The regimen is more effective the sooner after intercourse it is taken. 2. Copper-bearing intrauterine devices (IUDs)# WHO recommends that a copper-bearing IUD, as an emergency contraceptive, be inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse. This may be an ideal emergency contraceptive for a woman who is hoping for an ongoing, highly effective contraceptive method.# Mode of action: As emergency contraception, the copper-bearing IUD primarily prevents fertilization by causing a chemical change that damages sperm and egg before they can meet.# Effectiveness: When inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse, a copper-bearing IUD is over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. This is the most effective form of emergency contraception available. Once inserted, she can continue to use the IUD as an ongoing method of contraception.# Postcoital contraceptives. Drugs. Dose.

Signs such as intracranial calcification, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and severe intrauterine growth restriction strongly suggest in utero infection in the presence of documented maternal infection.* Maternal-fetal transmission occurs between 1 and 4 months following placental colonization by tachyzoites* There are 2 goals of drug therapy for toxoplasmosis, depending on whether or not fetal infection has occurred. If maternal infection has occurred but the fetus is not infected, Spiramycin is used for fetal prophylaxis (to prevent spread of organisms across the placenta from mother to fetus). Spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is concentrated in but does not readily cross the placenta, and therefore is not reliable for treatment of fetal infection. Use is aimed at preventing vertical transmission of the parasite to the fetus, and it is indicated only before fetal infection* It is given at a dose of 1 g (3 million U) orally every 8 hours. lt will be prescribed for the duration of the pregnancy if the amniotic fluid polymerase chain reaction is reported negative for T. gondii.* If fetal infection has been confirmed or is highly suspected, pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are used for treatment. Pyrimethamine is a folic acid antagonist that acts synergistically with sulfonamides. This drug should not be used in the first trimester because it is potentially teratogenic. It produces a reversible, dose related depression of the bone marrow and therefore must be combined with folinic acid. The combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine results in a significant decrease in disease severity.",

Accidental administration of ergometrine or methergin during delivery of first baby in undiagnosed twins produce grave danger to the unborn 2nd baby caused by asphyxia due to tetanic uterine contractions. MANAGEMENT OF THE THIRD STAGE OF LABORThe third stage of labor begins following the delivery of the baby and ends with the delivery of the placenta. Signs of spontaneous placental separation include an apparent lengthening of the umbilical cord, a gush of vaginal bleeding, and a change in shape of the uterus from discoid to globular along with a rise in fundal height. Active management of the third stage of labor, which involves prompt umbilical cord clamping and cutting, administration of an oxytocic agent, and gentle umbilical cord traction, reduces maternal blood loss and the frequency of postpartum hemorrhage, and lessens the risk that the third stage will be prolonged.# Cord clamping is part of management of 2nd stage of labour.# Cord traction should be used only against fundally applied counter-traction to lessen the potential for uterine inversion and catastrophic hemorrhage. If at any time heavy bleeding occurs during the third stage of labor or if the placenta is not delivered within 30 minutes of the birth, the placenta should be manually removed.# General anesthesia may be required for women who have no regional anesthesia, and curettage may be necessary if the placenta does not readily separate from the uterine wall.# Manual removal is accomplished by developing a cleavage plane with the intrauterine hand between the maternal surface of the placenta and the uterine wall, while simultaneously fixing the uterus with the abdominal hand, and progressively peeling the placenta free.# If any portion of the placenta or the membranes is missing, the uterine cavity should be manually explored. Some advocate routine exploration of the uterine cavity to reduce the risk of infection and bleeding from retained placental fragments. In most women, especially those without regional anesthesia, the benefit of manual exploration is outweighed by the discomfort it causes, as well as the increased risk for uterine infection.# The uterus should be frequently palpated following delivery of the placenta to ensure that it remains well contracted. Oxytocin, 10 to 20 U administered intramuscularly or as a dilute intravenous solution, has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage secondary to uterine atony. The birth canal, including the cervix, vagina, and perineum should be inspected for lacerations requiring repair.",

        "question": "Which among the following is definitive indicator for start of Active labour?",
        "exp": "Ans. B. Cervical dilatation > 3 cm. (Ref. Williams Obstetrics 22nd/ Ch. 17)CHARACTERISTICS OF NORMAL LABOR# The strict definition of labor-uterine contractions that bring about demonstrable effacement and dilatation of the cervix-docs not easily aid the clinician in determining when labor has actually begun, because this diagnosis is confirmed only retrospectively.# Several methods may be used to define its start - One quantifies onset as the clock time when painful contractions become regular. Unfortunately, uterine activity that causes discomfort, but that does not represent true labor, may develop at any time during pregnancy. A second method defines the onset of labor as beginning at the time of admission to the labor unit. Criteria at term require painful uterine contractions accompanied by one of the following: 1) ruptured membranes, 2) bloody \"show\", 3) complete cervical effacement. FIRST STAGE OF LABOR - Friedman developed the concept of three functional divisions of labor:# Although the cervix dilates little during the preparatory division, the connective tissue components of the cervix change considerably. Sedation and conduction analgesia are capable of arresting this division of labor. The dilatational division, during which time dilatation proceeds at its most rapid rate, is unaffected by sedation or conduction analgesia. The pelvic division commences with the deceleration phase of cervical dilatation. The classical mechanisms of labor that involve the cardinal fetal movements of the cephalic presentation-engagement, flexion, descent, internal rotation, extension, and external rotation-take place principally during the pelvic division.- Two phases of cervical dilatation are defined.# The latent phase corresponds to the preparatory division and# The active phase to the dilatational division. Friedman subdivided the active phase into: the acceleration phase, the phase of maximum slope, and deceleration phase. Latent Phase:# The onset of latent labor, as defined by Friedman (1972), is the point at which the mother perceives regular contractions. The latent phase for most women ends at between 3 and 5 cm of dilatation.# Friedman and Sachtleben (1963) defined a prolonged latent phase as bein$ greater than 20 hours in the nullipara and 14 hours in the multipara. These are the 95th percentiles.# Factors that affect duration of the latent phase include:- excessive sedation or epidural analgesia;- unfavorable cervical condition, that is, thick, uneffaced, or undilated; and- false labor. Active Labor:# Cervical dilatation of 3 to 5 cm or more, in the presence of uterine contractions, can be taken to reliably represent the threshold for active labor.# Turning again to Friedman (1955), the mean duration of active-phase labor in nulliparas was 4. 9 hours. Indeed, rates of cervical dilatation ranged from a minimum of 1. 2 up to 6. 8 cm/hr.# Friedman (1972) also found that multiparas progress somewhat faster in active-phase labor, with a minimum normal rate of 1. 5 cm/hr.# Descent begins in the later stage of active dilatation, commencing at about 7 to 8 cm in nulliparas and becoming most rapid after 8 cm.# Active-labor phase abnormalities are quite common, reported in 25 percent of nulliparous and 15 percent of multigravidas.# Friedman (1972) subdivided active-phase problems into protraction and arrest disorders.- He defined protraction as a slow rate of cervical dilatation or descent, which for nulliparas was less than 1. 2 cm dilatation per hour or less than 1 cm descent per hour. For multiparas, protraction was defined as less than 1. 5 cm dilatation per hour or less than 2 cm descent per hour. He defined arrest as a complete cessation of dilatation or descent.- Arrest of dilatation was defined as 2 hours with no cervical change, and arrest of descent as 1 hour without fetal descent. SECOND STAGE OF LABOR# This stage begins when cervical dilatation is complete and ends with fetal delivery.# The median duration is about 50 minutes for nulliparas and about 20 minutes for multiparas. DURATION OF LABOR# It is reported that the mean length of first- and second-stage labor was approximately 9 hours in nulliparous women without regional analgesia, and that the 95th percentile upper limit was 18. 5 hours. Corresponding times for multiparous women were a mean of about 6 hours with a 95th percentile maximum of 13. 5 hours.",

Dutta, Obstertics, 6th ed., p 284)DIABETES IN PREGNANCY# Gestational diabetes usually begins in the second half of pregnancy, and goes away after the baby is bom. Effects on the fetus:# Macrosomia# IUGR# Newborns of diabetic mothers are at risk of hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, and hyperviscosity.# Caudal regression syndrome: sacral agenesis (most characteristic feature)# Congenital defects: In pregnancies complicated by type I or II diabetes, the major cause of neonatal mortality is congenital malformation incompatible with life. Therefore, MS AFP should be determined at 16 to 18 wk gestation, and a thorough ultrasound examination should be performed at 18 to 22 wk.# Respiratory distress syndrome# Left lazy colon syndrome# Stillbirth or death as a newborn is rare.# Increased risk of the baby developing type II diabetes or being overweight later in life. Effects on the mother# Women who get gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes in future pregnancies, and are at a higher risk of developing type II diabetes later in life.# Diagnosing gestational diabetes- Urine is routinely tested for sugar throughout pregnancy, and high blood sugar, if present, is usually detected between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.- The only way to confirm gestational diabetes is with a glucose tolerance test, which needs to be carried out after eight hours without food.- When suspected, GTT may be carried out earlier than 24-28 weeks. Q# Treatment- A few women's blood sugar levels remain too high, and they may need daily injections of insulin.- The extra insulin will not cross the placenta and will not affect the baby.- In almost every case, gestational diabetes disappears on its own after delivery. Q# Labor and Delivery- During the 3rd trimester, care of diabetic women consists mainly of controlling maternal plasma glucose levels, assessing fetal well-being, and determining fetal pulmonary maturation.- For most women with gestational diabetes, labor begins spontaneously at term, and delivery is vaginal. If these pregnancies go beyond 42 wk, the fetus is at risk of death in utero, so labor should be induced.- Cesarean section may be necessary in cases of dysfunctional labor or cephalopelvic disproportion or to avoid shoulder dystocia and injury to the newborn and to the birth canal.# Postpartum Care- For women with type I diabetes, insulin requirements decrease dramatically but gradually increase after about 72 h.- Women who have had gestational diabetes should have a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test with 75 g of glucose at 6 to 12 wk postpartum to determine whether they are normal, clearly diabetic, or have impaired glucose tolerance (based on WHO criteria). Educational points: HPL has putative actions in a number of important metabolic processes. These include. 1. Maternal lipolysis and an increase in the levels of circulating free fatty acids, thereby providing a source of energy for maternal metabolism and fetal nutrition. 2. An anti-insulin or \"diabetogenic\" action, leading to an increase in maternal levels of insulin, which favors protein synthesis and provides a readily available source of amino acids for transport to the fetus. 3. A potent angiogenic hormone; it also may play an important role in the formation of fetal vasculature.",

CG are sensitive to levels of 10 to 20 m. IU/mL and are positive in greater than 99 percent of ectopic pregnancies. Sonography is the most accurate tool for diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy as it helps in the localization of the gestational sac and the site of rupture and haemoperitneum. On Sonography, there is a characteristic absence of gestational sac in the uterine cavity as well as absence fluid in the pouch o douglas and the presence of haemoperitoneum. In cases of an obvious rupture, the fallopian tube site can also be made out on TVS. This simple technique was used commonly in the past to identify haemoperitoneum. The cervix is pulled toward the symphysis with a tenaculum, and a long 16- or 18-gauge needle is inserted through the posterior vaginal fornix into the cul-de-sac.

        "question": "Which of the following is a Sign of ovulation?",
        "exp": "Ans. A. Subnuclear vacuolation. (Ref. Williams9 Gync lst/Fig, 15-20; Obstetrics Dutta 7th/pg. 17-18). The endometrial cycle follows the changes in the endometrium during the 'menstrual' cycle. It is divided into phases with characteristic histological changes:# Proliferative phase (pre-ovulatory) - can be though of as building the endometrium at the same time as the follicle is maturing for ovulation (need to grow before it can secrete)# Interval phase# Secretory (post-ovulatory)- can be thought of as preparing for implantation (secretory in order to support implantation)# Menstrual phase. Proliferative Phase. The glands are simple. Mitotic activity is conspicuous. In the endometrium, the proliferative activity occurs even before the complete cessation of menstruation, i. e. a few days into the cycle. The glands at this earlier stage are relatively straight or at most slightly coiled and are found within relatively loose endometrial stroma. There is brisk cell division with prominent mitotic activity in both the glands and the stroma. Under the influence of oestrogen, the stroma is often the thickest at day 10. After this, the rate of glandular growth relative to the stroma results in coiling of the glands as the cycle moves towards ovulation. The nuclei rather than central are pseudostratified, though they tend to be found in the basal half. Interval Phase. The interval phase occurs over a short period of 24-48 hours. 1-2 days folllowing ovulation, there is peak of luteinizing hormone and increased progesterone, which brings on the secretory changes. The early interval phase is therefore indistinguishable from late proliferative phase without biochemical corrobation. The cut-off is somewhat arbitrary, but there may be a brief overlap of proliferative and secretory phase features, the latter manifest as subnuclear vacuolation. Secretory Phase. The amount of subnuclear vacuolation is at its maximum in the early secretory phase (days 3-4 post-ovulation or days 17- 18 of the cycle) and are initially seen to line up giving the appearence of a line of vacuoles and a line nuclei. Mitotic activity is minimal as the glands are no longer dividing, but the cells dilate and become more tortuous. As the cycle moves into the mid-secretory phase, the vacuoles begin to be found above the nuclei as they head for the luminal surface.# Early secretory phase change. There are subnuclear vacuoles. The glands are beginning to become convoluted. Mitotic activity is now absent.# In the mid-secretory phase (days 5-11 post-ovulation or days 19-25 of the cycle), the glands remain dilated, but become more irregular with a papillary or saw-tooth appearence. The vacuoles move to a supranuclear position and the contents may be seen within the lumina. The stroma becomes looser and more oedematous, becoming most prominent at days 20-22. Day 21 is regarded as the optimal time for implantation. Decidualisation of the stroma also occurs.# In the late secretory phase (days 26-28), decidualisation extends from the surface to the deeper stroma. Lymphocytes being to appear. Menstrual Phase. In the absence of conception, h. CG is not produced and corpus luteum is unable to sustain itself. Withdrawal of progesterone causes the stroma to crumble, forming balls of deep blue stromal cells (with H&E staining). Secretions are also exhausted at this stage and the glands break off. Red blood cells and neutrophils are mixed between the involuting structures. OVULATIONDefinition: It is a process whereby a secondary oocyte is released form the ovary following the rupture of graafian follicle and becomes available for the conception. Mechanism: A. Changes in the follicle: a. Preovulatory enelargement of the Graafian follicle due to accumulation of follicular fluid and measures 20 mm in diameter. b. The cumulus oophorus separates separates from the rest of granulosa cells and floats freely in the antrum. The inner layer of cells surrounding the oocyte is arranged radially and is termed corona radiata. The stigma develops as a conical projection, which penetrates the outer surface layer of ovary. The cumulus escapes out of the follicle as a slow oozing process, taking about 1-2 minutes along with varying amount of follicular fluid. c. Changes in the oocyte: Prior to ovulation its cytoplasmic volume is increased along with chnages in the number and distribution of mitochondria and in the golgi apparatus. Completion of arrested first meiotic division occurs with extrusion of the fitrst polar body, each containing haploid number of chromosomes. Causes:# LH surge: Sustained peak level of estrogen for 24-36 hrs in the late follicular phase -LH surge occurs form anterior pituitary (persists for 24 hrs) - Ovulation occurs approx 24-36 hrs after LH surge ->LH surge stimulates completion of reducation division of the oocyte -^initiate leutinisation, synthesis of progesterone and pgs. IT IS THE BEST PREDICTOR OF OVULATION.# FSH rise: Preovulatory rise of progesterone facilitates the positive feedback action of estrogen to induce FSH surge a increase in plaminogen activator a plasminogen a plasmin a helps lysis of the walls of follicle. Thus, the combined LH/FSH midcycle surge is responsible for the final tage of maturation, rupture of the follicle, and expulsion of the oocyte.# Stretching factor# Contraction of micromuscles in the theca externa and ovarian stroma due to increased pg synthesis.",

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is an injectable progestin-only contraceptive that provides highly effective, private, three-month-long reversible contraception. Use of DMPA eliminates the need for daily user action, action near the time of sexual intercourse, and need for partner cooperation. o. It is given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection and forms a long-lasting depot from which it is slowly released over a period of several months. It takes one week to take effect if given after the first five days of the period cycle, and is effective immediately if given during the first five days of the period cycle. Estimates of first-year failure rates are about 0. 3%. MPA is effective in preventing pregnancy, but offers no protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). o. DMPA is a very effective form of contraception because of its multiple mechanisms of action and slow release into the circulation. Mechanism of actiono. High-dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as DMPA, inhibit follicular development and prevent ovulation as their primary mechanism of action by decreasing the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn.

        "question": "\"Conduplicato corpore\" indicates spontaneous_____",
        "exp": "Ans. d (Expulsion) (Ref. Williams Obstetrics 22nd/Ch. 20). If the fetus is small--usually less than 800 g--and the pelvis is large, spontaneous delivery is possible despite persistence of the abnormal lie. The fetus is compressed with the head forced against the abdomen. A portion of the thoracic wall below the shoulder thus becomes the most dependent part, appearing at the vulva. The head and thorax then pass through the pelvic cavity at the same time, and the fetus, which is doubled upon itself, sometimes referred to as conduplicato corpore, is expelled. TRANSVERSE LIE# The long axis of the fetus is approximately perpendicular to that of the mother. When the long axis forms an acute angle, an oblique lie results. The latter is usually only transitory, because either a longitudinal or transverse lie commonly results when labor supervenes. For this reason, the oblique lie is called an unstable lie.# In transverse lies, the shoulder is usually over the pelvic inlet, with the head lying in one iliac fossa and the breech in the other. In such a shoulder presentation, the side of the mother on which the acromion rests determines the designation of the lie as right or left acromial. Moreover, because in either position the back may be directed anteriorly or posteriorly, superiorly or inferiorly, it is customary to distinguish varieties as dorsoanterior and dorsoposterior. Diagnosis# The diagnosis usually is made easily, often by inspection alone.# On vaginal examination, in the early stages of labor, the side of the thorax, if it can be reached, may be recognized by the \"gridiron\" feel of the ribs. When dilatation is further advanced, the scapula and the clavicle are distinguished on opposite sides of the thorax. The position of axilla indicates the side of the mother toward which shoulder is directed. Etiology# Abdominal wall relaxation from high parity.# Preterm fetus.# Placenta previa.# Abnormal uterine anatomy.# Excessive amnionic fluid.# Contracted pelvis. Mechanism of Labor# Spontaneous delivery of a fully developed newborn is impossible with a persistent transverse lie. After rupture of the membranes, if labor continues, the fetal shoulder is forced into the pelvis, and the corresponding arm frequently prolapses. After some descent, the shoulder is arrested by the margins of the pelvic inlet, with the head in one iliac fossa and the breech in the other. As labor continues, the shoulder is impacted firmly in the upper part of the pelvis. The uterus then contracts vigorously in an unsuccessful attempt to overcome the obstacle. With time, a retraction ring rises increasingly higher and becomes more marked. The situation is referred to as a neglected transverse lie. If not promptly managed, the uterus eventually ruptures, placing the mother and fetus at grave risk. Even with the best of care, morbidity is T because of the frequent association with placenta previa, the T likelihood of cord prolapse, and the necessity for major operative efforts. Management# In general, the onset of active labor in a woman with a transverse lie is an indication for cesarean delivery. Once labor is well established, attempts at conversion to a longitudinal lie by abdominal manipulation will likely not be successful. Before labor or early in labor, with the membranes intact, attempts at external version are worthy of a trial in the absence of other complications that indicate cesarean delivery. If during early labor, the fetal head can be maneuvered by abdominal manipulation into the pelvis, it should be held there during the next contractions in an attempt to fix the head in the pelvis. If these measures fail, cesarean delivery is performed.# Because neither the feet nor the head of the fetus occupies the lower uterine segment, a low transverse incision into the uterus may lead to difficulty in extraction of a fetus entrapped in the body of the uterus above the level of incision. Therefore, a vertical incision is likely to be indicated.",

In type II posterior placenta praevia the major thickness of placenta overlies the sacral promontory, thereby diminishing the anteroposterior diameter of inlet and prevents engagement of the presenting part. This hinders effective compression of the separated placenta to stop bleeding. Different types of placenta praevia. Type 1 (low lying) - major part of placenta is attached to the upper segment and only the lower margin encroaches on to the lower segment but not upto the os. Type 2 (marginal) - The placenta reaches the margin of the internal os but does not cover it. It is divided into anterior and posterior. Type 3 (incomplete or partial centre) - placenta covers the internal os partially (covers the internal os) when the os is closed but does not entirely do when fully dilated. Type 4 (central or total) - placenta completely covers the internal os even after it is fully dilated. For clinical purpose placenta praevia are graded into mild degree which includes Type I and Type II anterior and major degree which include Type II posterior. Type III and Type IV.

        "question": "Cardiac output peaks during pregnancy at what gestational age?",
        "exp": "Ans. c (32 weeks). (Ref. Textbook of Obstetrics by Dutta, 4th ed., 53). Cardiac output starts to increase from 10th week of pregnancy, reaches its peak of 40% at about 24-30 weeks. PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH PREGNANCYCardiovascular System1. Blood Volume# Increases progressively from 6-8 weeks gestation (pregnancy)# Reaches a maximum at approximately 32-34 weeks. The increase in plasma volume (40-50%) is relatively greater than that of red cell mass (20-30%) resulting in hemodilution and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration. Intake of supplemental iron and folic acid is necessary to restore hemoglobin levels to normal (12 g/dl). The increased blood volume serves two purposes. First, it facilitates maternal and fetal exchanges of respiratory gases, nutrients and metabolites. Second, it reduces the impact of maternal blood loss at delivery. Typical losses of 300-500 ml for vaginal births and 750-1000 ml for Caesarean sections are thus compensated with the so-called \"autotransfusion\" of blood from the contracting uterus. 2. Blood Constituents. As mentioned above, red cell mass is increased by 20-30%. Leukocyte counts are variable during gestation, but usually remain within the upper limits of normal. Marked elevations, however, develop during and after parturition (delivery). 3. Fibrinogenas well as total body and plasma levels of factors VII, X and XII increase markedly. The number of platelets also rises, yet not above the upper limits of normal. Combined with a decrease in fibrinolytic activity, these changes tend to prevent excessive bleeding at delivery. Thus, pregnancy is a relatively hypercoagulable state, but during pregnancy neither clotting or bleeding times are abnormal. 4. Cardiac Output. Increases to a similar degree as the blood volume. During the first trimester cardiac output is 30-40% higher than in the non-pregnant state. Steady rises are shown on Doppler echocardiography, from an average of 6. 7 litres/ minute at 8-11 weeks to about 8. 7 litres/minute flow at 36-39 weeks. They are due, primarily, to an increase in stroke volume (35%) and, to lesser extent, to a more rapid heart rate (15%). There is a steady reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) which contributes towards the hyperdynamic circulation observed in pregnancy. 5. Cardiac Size/ Position/ECGThere are both size and position changes which can lead to changes in ECG appearance. The heart is enlarged by both chamber dilation and hypertrophy.",

A plastic clamp that is safe, efficient, and fairly inexpensive. Timing of Cord Clamping. If after delivery, the newborn is placed at or below the level of the vaginal introitus for 3 minutes and the fetoplacental circulation is not immediately occluded by clamping the cord, an average of 80 mL of blood may be shifted from the placenta to the neonate. This provides about 50 mg of iron, which reduces the frequency of iron deficiency anemia later in infancy. Accelerated destruction of erythrocytes, as found with maternal alloimmunization, forms additional bilirubin from the added erythrocytes and contributes further to the danger of hyperbilirubinemia. Although the theoretical risk of circulatory overloading from gross hypervolemia is formidable, especially in preterm and growth-retarded neonates, the addition of placental blood to the otherwise normal newborn's circulation ordinarily does not cause difficulty.",

These villi invade and destroy the uterine decidua while at the same time they absorb nutritive materials from it to support the growth of the embryo.* During the primary stage (primay villi formed on the 13th day following fertilization), the chorionic villi are small, nonvascular, and contain only the trophoblast. During the secondary stage (secondary villi formed on 16th day following fertilization) the villi increase in size and ramify, while the mesoderm grows into them; at this point the villi contain trophoblast and mesoderm.* During the tertiary stage (tertiary villi completed on 21st day) the branches of the umbilical vessels grow into the mesoderm; in this way, the chorionic villi are vascularized. At this point, the villi contain trophoblast, mesoderm, and blood vessels.",

Text book of Obstetrics by DC Dutta 7th/pg. 174........... Mifepristone (RU 486/progesterone receptor antagonist) is effective in inducing therapeutic abortion upto 63 days of gestation, but is most effective when used with 49 days of gestation. Uses of Mifepristone (RU-486)(anti-progestin): APostcoital contraceptive. Mifepristone 600 mg given 72 hrs of intercourse interferes with implantation and is highly effective method of emergency contraception. The menstrual cycle is however disturbed. B. Termination of pregnancy# Up to 7 weeks: 600 mg as single dose causes complete abortion in 60-85% cases. # To improve the success rate, current recommendation is to follow up 48 hrs later by a single 400 mg oral dose of misoprotol. This achieves > 90% success rate and is the accepted nonsurgical method of early first trimester abortion.# In place of oral Misoprostol, a 1 mg geneprost pessary can be inserted intravaginally. Mifepristone administered within 10 days of missed period results in an apparent late heavy period in upto 90% cases.# Anorexia, nausea, tiredness, abdominal discomfort, uterine crapms, loose motions are the side effects, apart from problems like prolonged bleeding and failed abortion in some cases. C. Cervical ripening24-30 hrs before attempteing surgical abortion or induction of labour, mifepristone 600 mg results in softening of cervix. D. Once a month contraceptiveA single 200 mg dose of mifepristone given 2 days after the midcycle each month prevents conception on most occasions. E. Induction of labour. By blocking the relaxant action of progesterone on uterus of late pregnancy, mifepristone can induce labour. It may be tried in cases with IUD and to deliver abnormal fetuses. F. Cushing's syndrome. Mifepristone has palliative effect due to glucocorticoid receptor blocking property. May be used for inoperable cases. Note: Other recently developed antiprogestins are Onapristone (a pure antagonist ) and Gestinone (most efficacious in endometriosis). Gossypol is nonsteroidal compound obtained from cotton seeds. Its effective orally-causes suppression of spermatogenesis in 99% men and reduces sperm motility.",

They cause bronchodilatation, vasodilatation and uterine relaxation, without producing significant cardiac stimulation. b2 selectivity is only relative. Salbutamol has b2: bj action ratio of about 10. They are primarily used in bronchial asthma. Other uses are:# As uterine relaxant to delay premature labour. Ritodrine is the preferred drug;# In hyperkalemic familial periodic paralysis - benefit by enhancing K+ uptake into muscles a lowering plasma K+ levels.

Tocolytic Agents. Comments1. Isosuprine (DUVADILAN). It is an orally effective long acting selective b receptor stimulant, which has direct smooth muscle relaxant property as well. It has been used as uterine relaxant for threatened abortion and dysmenorrhoea, but efficacy is poor. Side effects: nausea, tachycardia, flushing, dizziness, and tremor. Isoxsuprine has been used in threatened abortion and dysmenorrhoea, but efficacy is doubtful. 2. Ritodrine (Selective b2 stimulants)infused i. v. have been successfully used to postpone labour but maternal morbidity and mortality may be increased due to their cardiac and metabolic actions and incidents of pulmonary edema. 3. Atosiban & nifedipine. Although atosiban and nifedipine seem equally effective in delaying preterm labour, there is increasing concern in twin pregnancies about the adverse CVS effects of nifedipine. Nifedipine should not be used in multiple pregnancies due to fear of pul edema. However, atosiban, which is principally an AVP receptor antagonists is oxytocin receptor antagonist, used for the treatment of preterm labour. 4. Magnesium sulphate. Also acts as a tocolytic agent. With the withdrawal of sympathomimetic drugs and the failure of atosiban, an oxytocinantagonist, to obtain FDA approval, magnesium sulphate is therefore in commonly used tocolytic drug. Educational points:# Tolterodine is being developed as a vasicoselective antimuscarinic.# Tiotropiumbromide Congener of ipratropium bromide, which binds very tightly to bronchial M1/M3 muscarinic receptors producing long lasting bronchodilatation. Binding to M2 receptors is less tight confering relative M1/M3 selectivity. Like ipratropium, it is not absorbed from respiratory and g. i. mucosa and has exhibited high bronchial selectivity of action.",

It is lined by a single layer of amniotic epithelium but shows stratification like that of fetal epidermis near term.# It contains Wharton's jelly formed by mucoid degeneration of extraembryonic mesodermal cells. Of the two umbilical veins, the right one disappears by the 4th month, leaving behind one vein which carries oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus. The proximal part of Vitelline duct may persist as Meckel's diverticulum. Allantois is a blind tubular structure that may be occasionally present near fetal end which is continuous inside with the fetus with its urachus and bladder. In early period, intraembryonic coelom is continuous with extraembryonic coelom along the herniation of coils of intestine (mid gut). The condition may persist as congenital umbilical hernia or exomphalos.# The umbilical cord is 40 cm in length (range 30-100 cm). Its diameter is 1. 5 cm.

It is done using lymphoscintigraphy with technetium-99m labeled nanocolloid or isosulfan blue dye to identify a sentinel node that would predict the presence or absence of regional nodal metastasis.* The main advantage of this procedure is that it decreases unnecessary lymph node dissections, where it is not necessary, thereby reducing the risk of lymphedema and other complications. The main uses are in breast cancer and malignant melanoma surgery, although it has been used in other tumor types with a degree of success.* Vulvar cancer was the first and most promising gynecological site for the sentinel lymph node biopsy strategy. As it involves a cutaneous tumor, peritumoral injections are easy and the sentinel lymph node is always located in the groin. This is another factor making the vulva an ideal site for sentinel lymph node biopsy. Preliminary studies indicate that a sentinel node can be identified in most of the patients of Ca vulva. Trials are on to determine the accuracy of negative predictive value of a uninvolved sentinel node.

Victims of rape should always be treated as victims and at no time should the implication of guilt be applied to them. Psychological reaction to rape includes two phases: an immediate phase of paralysis of the coping mechanisms, usually lasting hours or days, followed by a more prolonged period of reorganization that may last months to years. The victim's menstrual history, birth control regimen, and known pregnancy status should be assessed at the initial examination. In the experience of most sexual assault centers, the chance that pregnancy will occur as a result of sexual assault is quite small and has been estimated to be approximately 2 to 4% for victims having a single unprotected coitus. If the patient has been exposed at midcycle, the risk would obviously be higher. \"Morning-after\" prophylaxis using high-dose estrogens or oral contraceptives should be offered to unprotected rape victims. About 10% of all physically abused children are also sexually abused. Although the crime is underreported, it is estimated that about 336, 000 children are sexually abused each year in the United States. Incestual activity may be experienced by as many as 15 to 25% of women and 12% of men. A family member is the sexual abuser of a child in about 80% of cases.

In most cases, five to seven uterine contractions within a 15-minute period reflect adequate uterine activity. Increased contraction frequency is termed uterine tachysystole and is defined by six or more uterine contractions within a 10-minute window for two consecutive windows.# The duration is assessed by calculating the length of the contraction, the fine vertical lines represent 10-second intervals, and heavy lines denote 1-minute intervals (run at 3 cm per minute). Normal uterine contractions last approximately 40 to 60 seconds. Prolonged contractions may result from \"coupling\" of contractions, uterine hyperstimulation, or acute complications such as placental abruption or uterine rupture.# The strength of the contractions can only be assessed with the direct Intrauterine Pressure Catheters (IUPC). The normal baseline uterine pressure between contractions is approximately 10 mm Hg.# Abnormally high baseline pressures in excess of 20 mm Hg may result from hyperstimulation or occasionally from overdistention of the uterus by excessive amnioinfusion, polyhydramnios, or fetal macrosomia. During contractions, normal uterine pressure ranges from 30 to 80 mm Hg, although pressures in excess of 80 mm Hg may be observed during the second stage of labor. The Montevideo unit = The Average intensity of the uterine contractions multiplied by the number of contractions over a 10-minute period (expressed as mm Hg/10 min).# Montevideo units in excess of 180 to 200 usually are considered to reflect adequate uterine activity to effect cervical change in labor.# A total of 200 Montevideo units indicates that there is adequate uterine contractility to effect labor progress.",

Breast feeding is recommended by all the nursing mothers immediately in about 30 min post delivery in cases of a normal delivery and usually within 4 hours in cases of a cesarean section unless some obvious contra-indication exists. Breast milk provides all the necessary nutrients that are needed for the growth and adequate development of a baby for the initial 6 months. Hence exclusive breast feeding is recommended. The first secretions on the initial 2-3 days is called as \"colostrum\" and it contains a very high quantity of immunoglobulins and hence it is recommended to commence breast feeding as early as possible. Active hepatitis B infection is not a contraindication for breast feeding provided the infant has received the anti-Hbs. Ag immunoglobulins and would be vaccinated soon. The immunoglobulins offer significant protection against the virus. Similarly, even active HCV infection is not a contraindication for breast feeding as the risk of viral transfer for HCV is only 4%.

        "exp": "Ans. A. PIH. (Ref Williams Obstetrics. 22nd ed. Chapter 48; pg. 1255-1258; Table 48-6). Today, renal failure is most often associated with severe preeclampsia - eclampsia [with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP syndrome) developed renal failure). Obstetrical hemorrhage, notably placental abruption, when it develops either alone or in concert with severe preeclampsia, is strongly linked to severe renal failure. \"Abruption placentae, with either overt or concealed hemorrhage, appears to be the most common antecedent event causing ARF. \"# Management- Oliguria is an important sign of acutely impaired renal function. In obstetrical cases, both prerenal and intrarenal factors are commonly operative. For example, with total placental abruption, severe hypovolemia is common from massive hemorrhage.- Superimposed preeclampsia may cause oliguria. Intense consumptive coagulopathy commonly triggered by an abruption might impede intrarenal microcirculation.- When azotemia is evident and severe oliguria persists, hemodialysis should be initiated before marked deterioration of general well-being occurs.- Early dialysis appears to reduce appreciably the mortality and may enhance the extent of recovery of renal function. With time, renal function usually returns to normal or near normal. Additional Educational points:# PLACENTAL ABRUPTION is the most common cause of severe consumptive coagulopathy in obstetrics.# Nulliparity, episiotomy, and forceps delivery are the most commonly associated risk factors with PUERPERAL HEMATOMAS# The most common cause of uterine rupture is separation of a previous cesarean hysterotomy scar.# The most commonly implicated contaminant of red cells in transfusion blood components is Yersinia enterocolitica.",

Hormonal regulation of the menstrual cycle* Menstrual cycle involves the interplay of ovarian, pituitary and hypothalamic hormones.* At the beginning of the cycle, the estrogen level is very low and progesterone level is negligible.* Therefore, the pituitary and hypothalamus are free from the negative feedback effect of estrogen and progesterone.* Hence the hypothalamus secretes Gn. RH and the anterior pituitary secretes FSH and some LH.* FSH stimulates follicular development.* Ovarian follicles secrete estrogen.* Estrogen tends to suppress FSH secretion, but progressive follicular development ensures a rise in estrogen level.* Around day 11 of the cycle, the estrogen level crosses a certain threshold.* Above this threshold level, estrogen has a positive feedback effect on LH secretion, and to some extent also on FSH secretion.* This leads to LH and FSH surge.* The LH surge is essential for ovulation.* After ovulation has taken place on day 14, the corpus luteum starts developing under the influence of LH.* Corpus luteum secretes estrogen, progesterone and inhibin.* The combined effect of these hormones is to suppress the secretion of FSH and LH by negative feedback effect on the anterior pituitary, and to a lesser extent also on the hypothalamic Gn. RH secretion.* Absence of support from FSH and LH leads to regression of the corpus luteum.* Regression of the corpus luteum leads to a sharp decline in estrogen and progesterone levels.* Withdrawal of support from estrogen and progesterone leads to menstrual bleeding.* Thus one cycle ends and the next cycle begins.",

        "question": "Which of the following is not a maneuvre used for treatment of shoulder dystocia?",
        "exp": "Ans. d (Lovset's manoeuvre). (Ref. Williams Obstetrics 22nd/Ch. l7). MANAGEMENT OF SHOULDER DYSTOCIAShoulder dystocia cannot be predicted. Reduction in the interval of time from delivery of the head to delivery of the body is of great importance to survival. An initial gentle attempt at traction, assisted by maternal expulsive efforts, is recommended. Some clinicians have advocated performing a large episiotomy, and adequate analgesia is certainly ideal. After clearing the neonate's mouth and nose, a variety of techniques can be used to free the anterior shoulder from its impacted position beneath the symphysis pubis: 1. Moderate suprapubic pressure can be applied by an assistant while downward traction is applied to the fetal head. 2. Mc. Roberts maneuver consists of removing the legs from the stirrups and sharply flexing them up onto the abdomen. They found that the procedure caused straightening of the sacrum relative to the lumbar vertebrae, rotation of the symphysis pubis toward the maternal head, and a decrease in the angle of pelvic inclination. Although this does not increase pelvic dimensions, pelvic rotation cephalad tends to free the impacted anterior shoulder. 3. Woods corkscrew maneuver: by progressively rotating the posterior shoulder 180 degrees in a corkscrew fashion, the impacted anterior shoulder could be released. 4. Delivery of the posterior shoulder consists of carefully sweeping the posterior arm of the fetus across the chest, followed by delivery of the arm. The shoulder girdle is then rotated into one of the oblique diameters of the pelvis with subsequent delivery of the anterior shoulder. 5. Rubin recommended two maneuvers. First, the fetal shoulders are rocked from side to side by applying force to the maternal abdomen. If this is not successful, the pelvic hand reaches the most easily accessible fetal shoulder, which is then pushed toward the anterior surface of the chest. This maneuver most often results in abduction of both shoulders, which in turn produces a smaller shoulder-to-shoulder diameter and displacement of the anterior shoulder from behind the symphysis pubis. 6. Deliberate fracture of the clavicle by pressing the anterior clavicle against the ramus of the pubis can be performed to free the shoulder impaction. In practice, however, it is difficult to deliberately fracture the clavicle of a large neonate. The fracture will heal rapidly and is not nearly as serious as a brachial nerve injury, asphyxia, or death. 7. Hibbard recommended that pressure be applied to the fetal jaw and neck in the direction of the maternal rectum, with strong fundal pressure applied by an assistant as the anterior shoulder is freed. Strong fundal pressure, however, applied at the wrong time may result in even further impaction of the anterior shoulder and fundal pressure in the absence of other maneuvers result in more complications rate. 8. Sandberg (1985) reported the Zavanelli maneuver for cephalic replacement into the pelvis and then cesarean delivery. The first part of the maneuver consists of returning the head to the occiput anterior or occiput posterior position if the head had rotated from either position. The operator flexes the head and slowly pushes it back into the vagina, following which cesarean delivery is performed. Terbutaline (250 pg subcutaneously) is given to produce uterine relaxation. Fetal injuries were common when the Zavanelli maneuver was used. Uterine rupture also was reported. 9. Cleidotomv consists of cutting the clavicle with scissors or other sharp instruments and is usually used for a dead fetus. 10. Sxmphxsiotomx also has been applied successfully, as described by Hartfield (1986). Goodwin and colleagues (1997) reported three cases in which symphysiotomy was performed after the Zavanelli maneuver had failed--all three neonates died and maternal morbidity was significant due to urinary tract injury. Summary: SHOULDER DYSTOCIA (an obstetric emergency)# It occurs when the fetal shoulders fail to spontaneously deliver secondary to impaction of the anterior shoulder against the pubic bone after delivery of the head has occurred.# A generous episiotomy should always be made to allow the obstetrician to have adequate room to perform a number of manipulations to try to relieve the dystocia.# Predisposing factors for shoulder dystocia: 1) Foetal Macrosomia2) Obesity3) Excessive wt gain in pregnancy4) Midpelvic instrumental delivery5) Anencephaly6) Foetal Ascites7) Short cord or cord tightly around neck.# Such maneuvers include (Clue: Shoulder Dystocia Wale Maneuvers - GRZl)- Suprapubic Pressure: This pressure is at the pubic bone, not at the top of the uterus. This might altow the shoutder enough room to move under the pubis symphysis.- delivery of the posterior shoulder.- Woods Maneuver: This is also known as the corkscrew; the attendant tries to turn the shoulder of the baby by placing fingers behind the shoulder and pushing in 180 degrees.- Mc. Robert's Maneuver: Flex the mother's legs toward her shoulders as she lays on her back, thus expanding the pelvic outlet. One study showed that this alleviated 42% of all cases of shoulder dystocia.- Gaskin Maneuver: Get the woman into a hands and knees position. This will also change the diameters of her pelvis, though is not always possible with epidural anesthesia.- Rubin Maneuver: Like the Woods maneuver, two fingers are placed behind the baby's shoulder; this time they are pushing in the directions of the baby's eyes, to line up the shoulders.- Zavanelli Maneuver: Pushing the baby's head back inside the vagina and doing a cesarean. This is the mostly frequently asked about method, but also one of the most dangerous.# There is no role for fundal pressure because this action further impacts the shoulder against the pubic bone and makes the situation worse.",

Some group A -hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus produce virulent exotoxins that can rapidly cause all features of the sepsis syndrome. Some virulent streptococci produce proteases that degrade IL-8. In pyelonephritis, E coli and Klebsiella species commonly cause bacteremia and sepsis syndrome.- Endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide released on lysis of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria.- A number of potent bacterial exotoxins can also cause severe sepsis syndrome. Examples include exotoxins from Clostridium perfringens, toxic shock syndrome toxin from S aureus, and toxic shock-like exotoxin from group A -hemolytic streptococci.- These exotoxins cause rapid and extensive tissue necrosis and gangrene, especially of the postpartum uterus, and may cause profound cardiovascular collapse with maternal death.",

The sperm cells accomplish this during the ascension through the female genital tract (in contact with its secretions). It has to do with a physiological maturation process of the sperm cell membranes, which is seen as the precondition for the next step to follow, namely the acrosome reaction.* Capacitation is a functional maturation of the spermatozoon. The changes take place via the sperm cell membrane in which it may be that receptors are made available through the removal of a glycoprotein layer. The area of the acrosomal cap is also so altered thereby that the acrosome reaction becomes possible.* Through the membrane alterations, the motile properties of the spermatozoon also change. Discharging whipping movements of the tail together with larger sideways swinging movements of the head take place. This type of motility is designated as hyperactivity. One can therefore say that the visible consequences of capacitation consist in hyperactivity of the spermatozoon.",

It is approved for 10 years of continuous use. Good Candidates for TCu380A# Postpartum women, breastfeeding or not, after 4 weeks.# Women with liver disease, hepatitis.# Women with breast cancer.# Women with hypertension, hyperlipidemia.# Women with current or history of ischemic heart disease, stroke.# Women with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Women with uncomplicated valvular heart disease.# Women with current deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism.# Women who have had major surgery.# Women with migraines with or without focal neurological symptoms.# Women with gall bladder disease or history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. The LNG-IUS (Mirena). is a T-shaped polydimethylsiloxane rod con- taining 52 mg LNG. The LNG-IUS is approved for 5 years of use. The LNG-IUS adds an important non-contra- ceptive advantage for this age group: it decreases menstrual blood loss and dysmenorrhea and may avoid the need for hysterectomy or endometrial ablation. The copper IUD is generally associated with heavier menses. In addition to decreasing menstrual blood loss, the local administration of LNG to the endometrium protects it from development of estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. This is of benefit for transitional women with irregular bleeding and for women on tamoxifen therapy following breast cancer. Use of the LNG-IUS is reported to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer by 40-60%. GOOD CANDIDATES FOR LNG-IUS# Women with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, or endometriosis.# Women with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulation therapy.

More Educational points:# Cu T 380A and Levenorgestrel have got lowest rate, whereas progestasert has got highest rate of ectopic pregnancy.# The Mirena IUD works by killing or irreparably damaging sperm and obstructing it's ability to fertilize an egg. It does this by releasing levonorgestrel, also known as progestin.# Progestin is a synthetic substance which imitates the biological activity of the natural hormone progesterone.# Progesterone can inhibit ovulation during pregnancy. Progestin was synthesized for, among reasons, suppresing ovulation for birth control.- Mirena reduces the frequency of ovulation. Ovulation occurs during the menstrual cycle where the ovarian follicle releases an egg. Reduction of the times in which an egg is available to fertilize handicaps the sperm's opportunity for reproduction.- Mirena changes the consistency of cervical mucus. This change thickens the cervical mucus making the passage of sperm through the cervix much more difficult.- Mirena thins the endometrium, the lining of the walls of the uterus. It is thought that this reduces the chances of embryo implantation to the endometrium. LNG-IUCD:# A new device, levonova (LNG IUD) contains 60mg of levonorgestrel and releases the hormone in very low doses i. e. 20 microgram/ day (versus Progestasert which carries 38mg of progesterone and releases 65microgram of the hormone per day).# It is thus longacting (5 years) and has low pregnancy rate of 0-3 per 100 woman years, n However, risk of ectopic pregnancy is higher.# Mechanism of action: - Strong and uniform endometrial suppression - Scanty cervical mucus - Anovulation and insufficient luteal phase and normal progesterone levels, n It can be used as hormone replacing therapy.# It is useful for the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia, n Irregular uterine bleeding can be a problem initially.# MIRENA contains 52mg levonorgestrel, eluting 20 microgram daily. It can be retained for 5 years, with failure rate of 0 to 3 per 100 woman years. EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION (Postcoital contraception). Mechanism of action1. Delaying /inhibiting ovulation2.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. Laparoscopy and hysteroscopy There is no treatment of choice or best treatment for proximal tubal obstruction (PTO) without proper evaluation of the tube because although proximal tubal obstruction is a frequent finding on hysterosalpingography (HSG) approximately 213rd of PTO reveals an absence of luminal obstruction. False positive diagnosis of PTO ranges from 16-40% and can be as high as 50%. Therefore careful evaluation of the fallopian tube prior to therapy is an absolute requirement. The distinction b/w true pathological occlusion, spasm or plugging and abnormality of the mucosa is crucial in determining therapy. Conventional HSG does not differentiate cornual spasm or other temporary causes from true obstruction. Selection of patients with tubal disease for future therapeutic management is based on tubal lesion including the state of tubal mucosa and tuboperitoneal assessment and the severity of tubal damage is key in determining the outcome. Proximal tubal occlusion is most treatable since it often occurs because of the accumulation of mucus or debris which forms an impacted plug in the interstitial or proximal isthumic portion of the tube. Until recently the treatment of PTO was a domain of microsurgery or I. V. F., but now days, tubal recanalization also plays an important role in the management of proximal tubal occlusion. In patients with documented tubal disease, options for management includes. Expectant management. MicrosurgeryI. V. F. Until recently, the management of proximal tubal obstruction was the domain of either microsurgery or I. V. F. Since microsurgery was technically very difficult and did not yield good results. So PTO's were frequently referred for I. V. F. Now day's Proximal tube recanalisation (PTR) with catheters or guidewires has gained wide application in treatment and diagnosis of proximal tube obstruction Proximal tube recanalisation is a non invasive method for the diagnosis and treatment of proximal tubal obstruction. Now IVF is required only in cases where the tubal mucosa is severely damaged and the obstruction is distal eg. Poor mucosal health. Obi iterative fibrosis. Distal tube obstruction. Bipolar tube damage The safety, efficacy. noninvasiveness reduced risk, costs and morbidity and encouraging results with fallopian tube recansalisation in the treatment and evaluation of proximal tubal obstruction makes them an excellent alternative to surgical invasive procedure and should be offered as the initial treatment in all patients with PTO. Hysteroscopy and Laparoscopy. Hysteroscopic tubal catherization in patients with PTO can be used both as a diagnostic and considerably effective therapeutic method. With laparoscopy, the hysteroscopic approach enables tubales cannulation and evaluation of the entire pelvic. Treatment of additional problems affecting the fallopian tubes particularly adhesion and endometriosis is possible. While laparoscopy helps monitor the procedure and visual assessment of tubal patency, the ability to observe the. UTJ's directly by hysteroscopy provides an excellent approach for tubal cannulation. Laparoscopic hysteroscopic tubal cannulation with or without guidewire cannulation has yielded an average recanalization success rate as high as 39%.

Obstructive apnea may occur when the infant s neck is hyperflexed or conversely, hyperextended.

It was then modified to distinguish fetal hemoglobin from maternal hemoglobin in blood samples from any source.* The Apt test may be used in cases of vaginal bleeding late during pregnancy (in cases of APH) to determine if the bleeding is from the mother or the fetus.* A positive test would indicate that blood is of fetal origin, and could be due to vasa previa. A negative test indicates that the blood is of maternal origin. In practice, the Apt test is almost never done when there is bleeding PV and a suspicion of vasa previa, because the time to fetal collapse with bleeding from vasa previa is often very short.* The test is based on the differences in the chemical properties between maternal and fetal hemoglobin. Adult hemoglobin is susceptible to alkaline denaturation whereas the fetal hemoglobin is resistant to it. The blood specimen is exposed to sodium hydroxide (Na. OH) which will denature the adult hemoglobin but not the fetal hemoglobin. Under the microscope, the fetal hemoglobin will appear as a pinkish color while the adult hemoglobin will appear as a yellow-brownish color.* Other uses of APT test: If the newborn has blood in vomiting, or stools, or active bleeding from the nasogastric tube; a positive Apt test would mean that the bleeding is from the neonate. A negative Apt test would indicate that the blood is of maternal origin, suggesting that the neonate swallowed or aspirated maternal blood, either during delivery or during breastfeeding (e. g. from breast fissures).* The Kleihauer- Betke (KB) test, is a blood test used to measure the amount of fetal hemoglobin transferred from a fetus to a mothers bloodstream (to quantify the fetomaternal hemorrhage).

This bacteria is normally found in the vagina and/or rectum of about 25 % of all healthy, adult women. Routine screening for vaginal strep B for all pregnant women is recommended. This screening is performed between the 35th and 37th week of pregnancy (studies show that testing done within 5 weeks of delivery is the most accurate at predicting the GBS status at time of birth.). The test involves a swab of both the vagina and the rectum. The sample is then taken to a lab where a culture is analyzed for any presence of GBS. Test results are usually available within 24 to 48 hours. Not every baby who is bom to a mother who tests positive for GBS will become ill. There are, however, symptoms that may indicate that patient are at a higher risk of delivering a baby with GBS. These symptoms include:* Labor or rupture of membrane before 37 weeks* Rupture of membrane 18 hours or more before delivery* Fever during labor* A urinary tract infection as a result of GBS during your pregnancy* A previous baby with GBS disease. If patient test positive for GBS and meet the high risk criteria, then it will require antibiotics through IV during delivery to prevent baby from becoming ill. Taking antibiotics greatly decreases the chances of r baby developing early onset group B strep infection.",

The patient is in active stage of labour once the cervix is effaced and dilated till 3 cm, following this the rate of dilatation is 1 cm/hour in cases of primigravidas and 1. 5 cm/hour in cases of multigravidas. The beginning of the 2 stage of labour is characterized by the complete dilatation and the effacement of the cervix. The main aim of the 2 stage of the labor is the expulsion of the foetus through the female reproductive tract. The 2 stage consists of engagement, progressive flexion and descent, internal rotation, restitution, external rotation and lateral flexion for the delivery of the trunk. Engagement occurs when the greatest possible transverse diameter of the foetus enters the pelvic brim. Flexion and descent are the processes which occurs constantly during the 2 stage. Internal rotation is the most important step occurring in the 2 stage. Expulsion of the placenta is the 3 stage of labor which immediately follows the expulsion of the foetus. Once the baby is expelled, active management of the third stage of labour is recommended. In this immediately post the delivery of the baby, and after ensuring that the uterus is adequately contracted, controlled cord traction, uterine massage and administration of uterotonics is carried out.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Rubella * Rubella is one of the most teratogenic agents known. Eighty percent of women with rubella infection and a history of rash during the first 12 weeks have a fetus with congenital infection. At 13-14 weeks, the incidence is about 54%, and it is 25% by the end of the second trimester. As the duration of pregnancy increases, fetal infections are less likely to cause congenital malformations.* In order to prevent rubella during pregnancy and congenital rubella syndrome, ACOG recommends that the MMR vaccine should be offered to women of childbearing age who do not have evidence of immunity whenever they make contact with the health-care system. Vaccination of susceptible women should-1) Be part of routine general medical and gynecological care, including college health services. 2) Take place in all family planning settings. 3) Be provided routinely to unimmunized women immediately after hospitalization, childbirth, or abortion, unless there are specific contraindications.* Vaccination of all susceptible hospital personnel who might be exposed to patients with rubella or who might have contact with pregnant women is recommended. Rubella vaccination should be avoided 1 month before or during pregnancy because the vaccine contains attenuated live virus.* In toxoplasmosis, the incidence and severity of congenital infection depend on the gestational age of the fetus at the time of maternal primary infection. Infection increases with duration of pregnancy, with the risk the fetal infection rising from 6% at 13 weeks to 72% at 36 weeks. Fetal infection is more virulent the earlier the infection is acquired. Treatment of pregnant women is thought to prevent and reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of congenital infection. Spiramycin, used alone, is thought to reduce the risk of congenital infection but not to treat established fetal infection. When fetal infection in diagnosed by prenatal testing, pyrimethamine, sulfonamides and folinic acid are added to spiramycin to eradicate parasites in the placenta and fetus.* Transmission of syphilis from a syphilitic mother to her fetus across the placenta may occur at any stage of pregnancy, but the lesions of congenital syphilis generally develop after the fourth month of gestation, when fetal immunologic competence begins to develop.* Perinatal transmission of hepatitis B occurs primarily in infants born to Hbs.

Oxytocin is a nanopeptide, synthesized in hypothalamus (Paraventricular nucleus) but stored and released by posterior pituitary. Its half life of 3-4 minutes. Alcohol inhibits its release. Uses: Stimulates labor, uterine contractions, milk let-down; controls uterine hemorrhage. Oxytocin when used for stimulation of labour should be discontinued if the number of contractions persists with a frequency > 5 in a 10-min period or 7 in a 15-min period or with a persistent nonreassuring FHR pattern. INTRAVENOUS OXYTOCIN ADMINISTRATION for stimulation of labour# The goal of induction or augmentation is to effect uterine activity sufficiently to produce cervical change and fetal descent while avoiding development of a nonreassuring fetal status.# Discontinuation of oxytocin nearly always rapidly decreases the frequency of contractions.# When oxytocin is stopped, its concentration in plasma rapidly falls because the mean half-life is approximately 5 min.# It is found that a uterine response occurs within 3 to 5 minutes of beginning an oxytocin infusion and that a plasma steady state is reached in 40 minutes.# Response depends on -- preexisting uterine activity, - cervical status, - pregnancy duration, and- individual biological differences.# The uterine response to oxytocin increases from 20 to 30 weeks and increases rapidly at term. Educational point:# Maximal Dosage of oxytocin- The maximal effective dose of oxytocin to achieve adequate contractions in all cases is not known.- Wen and colleagues found that the likelihood of progression to a vaginal delivery decreases at and beyond an oxytocin dosage of 36 mU/min.- At a dosage of 72 mU/min, however, half of the nulliparas were delivered vaginally.- Thus, if contractions are not adequate--less than 200 Montevideo units--and if the fetal status is reassuring andlabor has arrested, an oxytocin infusion dose greater than 48 mU/min has no apparent risks.

Harrison 18th/ p 38, 1082)HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV)# Exposures, which increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission, include -- Vaginal delivery, Preterm delivery; Maternal bleeding, and Trauma to the fetal skin, # Additional factors that may increase the risk of transmission include:- Recent infection with high maternal viral load, - Low maternal CD4 T cell count, prolonged labor, - Prolonged length of membrane rupture, and- The presence of other genital tract infections, such as syphilis or herpes.# Maternal transmission to the fetus occurs most commonly in the perinatal period.# In the absence of prophylactic antiretroviral therapy to the mother during pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and to the fetus following birth, the probability of transmission of HIV from mother to infant/fetus ranges from 15 to 25% in industrialized countries and from 25 to 35% in developing countries.# HIV transmission from mother to the baby can be minimized by: A. Antepartum Zidovudine therapy to mother and to the neonate after birthB. Maternal Vitamin A therapyD. Avoidance of breast feeding# The rate of MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION IS APPROACHING 1 % OR LESS IN PREGNANT women who are receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for their HIV infection.

Minimum (less effective; higher risk of drug resistance)-Single dose nevirapine-Single dose nevirapine. Treatment# The majority of cases of mother-to-child (vertical) transmission of HIV-1 occur during the intrapartum period.# Mechanisms of vertical transmission include infection after rupture of the membranes and direct contact of the fetus with infected secretions or blood from the maternal genital tract.# In women with HIV infection who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy, the rate of vertical transmission is approximately 25%.# Cesarean section and treatment with zidovudine, administered both before and during delivery, decrease the rate of vertical transmission.# In a meta-analysis, zidovudine treatment of both the mother during the prenatal and intrapartum periods and the neonate at birth reduced the risk of vertical transmission to 7. 3%.# The combination of elective cesarean section plus zidovudine treatment reduced the risk of vertical transmission to 2%. CYTOMEGALOVIRUS INFECTION# The most common cause of congenital viral infection in the United States is cytomegalovirus (CMV).# Severe CMV disease in the newborn is characterized most often by petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice.# Chorioretinitis (\"tomato sause & cheese\" appearance), microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, hepatitis, hemolytic anemia, and purpura may also develop.# Central nervous system involvement, resulting in the development of psychomotor, ocular, auditory, and dental abnormalities over time, has been described. RUBELLA# First trimester rubella carries a high risk of fetal anomalies, though the risk decreases significantly later.# Congenital rubella may be diagnosed by PUBS with the detection of IgM antibodies in fetal blood. HERPESVIRUS# The acquisition of genital herpes during pregnancy is associated with spontaneous abortion, prematurity, and congenital and neonatal herpes.# Infection occurs equally in all three trimesters.# In women who acquired genital herpes shortly before delivery, the risk of transmission is high.# The risk of active genital herpes lesions at term can be reduced by prescribing acyclovir for the last 4 weeks of pregnancy to women who have had their first episode of genital herpes during the pregnancy.# It is recommended that pregnant women with active genital herpes lesions at the time of presentation in labor be delivered by cesarean section. PARVOVIRUS (human parvovirus B19)# It rarely causes sequelae.# But susceptible women infected during pregnancy may be at risk for fetal hydrops secondary to erythroid aplasia and profound anemia. TOXOPLASMOSIS# The diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis is possible through sampling of fetal umbilical blood.# If there is no evidence of placental/fetal infection, single-drug treatment with spiramycin is recommended.# Triple-drug therapy with spiramycin, pyrimethamine, and sulfa is recommended if there is evidence of fetal infection and the woman does not wish to terminate the pregnancy or cannot terminate it because of advanced gestational age.",

Acceleration2 in 20 min. Deceleration. None or early. Baseline FHR is the mean level of FHR between the peaks and the depressions in beats per minute (bpm). Baseline variability is the oscillation of baseline FHR excluding the accelerations and decelerations. A base line variability of 5-25 bpm is a sign of fetal wellbeing. Accelerations are increased in FHR by 15 bpm or more lasting for at least 15 secs. Denotes healthy fetus. Deceleration is decrease in FHR below the baseline by 15 bpm or more. Three basic types of deceleration are observed: Early deceleration. Late deceleration. Variable deceleration. Type-1 dips. Due to headcompression. Type-ll dips. Due to utero-placentalinsufficiency and fetal hypoxia. Indicates cord compression and may disappear with the change in position of the patient. Pneumonic: (VEAL-CHOP)V- variable decelerationsC- cord compression/ prolapseE- early decelerationsH- Head compressionA- AccelerationsO-OKL- late acceelrationsP-Placental insuffiency. With each uterine contraction, blood flow to the placenta decreases, and the fetus is exposed to transient hypoxia. As the labor progresses and more and more contractions occur, this hypoxia can eventually lead to a change from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism- fetal acidemia. However, the fetus has a variety of protective mechanisms, including a blood buffering system and the diving reflex (a lowering of the heart rate in times of hypoxic stress), to protect it from becoming dangerously acidemic. Electronic fetal monitoring is not a very specific tool for identifying fetal acidemia. Many fetuses with a non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing do not have acidemia and are not in distress. However, it can be very difficult to distinguish non-acidemic fetuses with non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracings from acidemic fetuses with non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracings. Thus, the delivery of many fetuses is expedited because of the concern for fetal acidemia when, in fact, the fetus is not acidemic at all. Thus, it is most accurate to state, as is in this case, that the fetus was delivered because of the non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Fetal acidemia is not the reason for delivery. In fact, there is a strong likelihood that this fetus is not acidemic at all. Fetal distress is not the reason for delivery. There is a strong likelihood that this fetus is perfectly healthy and will have high neonatal APGAR scores and no distress at all. Fetal hypoxic encephalopathy is not the reason for delivery. The desire to prevent hypoxic/acidemic damage to organs, including the brain, is the reason for expediting delivery. However, the non-reassuring fetal tracing does not indicate that hypoxic encephalopathy is necessarily occurring. Low neonatal APGAR scores can be a marker of fetal acidemia. However, many fetuses with non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracings do not have low neonatal APGAR scores.",

It is especially appropriate at 13 to 16 weeks gestation, although many proponents use this procedure through 20 weeks.# If induction of labor is chosen, vaginal PGE2 is used, one 20-mg suppository is placed high in the posterior vaginal vault every 4 hours until the fetus and placenta are expelled.# In this situation, a retained placenta is relatively common and may require manual removal and uterine curettage.# Misoprostol, 200-mg tablets placed high in the vagina every 4 hours, is equally effective.

        "exp": "Ans. c (Aortic stenosis). (Ref. Dutta, Obstetrics, 6th ed., p 281)# Aortic stenosis has maternal mortality of 15-20% and Perinatal loss of 30%. HEART DISEASE IN PREGNANCY# The risk of fetal congenital malformations is increased by 3-10% if either parents have congenital lesions.# In mother with ASD, risk of having concordant abnormality in baby is very much high.# Most common heart disease in pregnancy is mitral stenosis.# The most common congenital heart disease during pregnancy is ASD.# Management: a) Management of first stage of labour. i) Place the patient in lateral recumbant position. ii) As a rule the quantity of infused fluid should not be more than 75 ml/hr to prevent pulmonary edema, except in Aortic Stenosis where the fluid therapy should not be restricted and the rate of infusion should be 125-150 ml/ hr. iii) Prophylaxis with antibiotics during the labour and 48 hrs after delivery is appropriate. b) Management of second stage of labour. Qi) Curtail the second stage of labour (ventouse is preferable to forceps as it can be applied without putting the patient in lithotomy position and thus preventing cardiac overload). ii) Withhold IV ergometrine with delivery of anterior shoulder to prevent sudden cardiac overload. iii) It is better to prefer ergometrine than oxytocin in all cases of heart disease.- Absolute indications for termination of pregnancy are primary pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger's syndrome. Q- In general there is no indication of Caesarean Section for heart disease except in Coarctation Of Aorta, where elective LSCS is indicated to prevent rupture of aorta or mycotic cerebral aneurysm. Qc) Epidural anaesthesia is preferable over general anaesthesia (contraindicated in AS). d) Anticoagulant therapy is not a contraindication for breast feeding. e) Barrier method is the contraception of choice, steroidal and IUCD are contraindicated. QBest time for mitral valvotomy in pregnancy with mitral stenosis is-44-18 weeks.# Mitral stenosis is especially dangerous because the tachycardia, increased blood volume, and increased cardiac output of pregnancy interact with this lesion to elevate pulmonary capillary pressure; atrial fibrillation is also common. Together, these factors increase the risk of pulmonary edema, the most lethal complication of mitral stenosis.# Mitral valvotomy can be performed during pregnancy, but open heart surgery increases the risks of abortion and fetal damage.# Prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be continued during pregnancy.# In patients with mitral stenosis, digoxin 0. 25 mg/day po is used if atrial fibrillation develops.# Labor and delivery are best tolerated at full term, and close attention to analgesia and to relief of anxiety is essential.# Generally the most hazardous time is during peak cardiac output (at 20 to 34 wk).",

        "question": "Treatment of choice for uterine prolaspe in a 40-year- old married female with completed family?",
        "exp": "Ans. C. Vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair. (Ref. Shaw Gynecology 15th/pg. 340; Novak's Gynecology 13th/pg. 290; Stenchever Gynecology 4, h/pg. 580)UTERINE PROLAPSE# Woman < 20 yr old. unmarried=Sling Operation# Young Woman (20-40 yrs) of child bearing age = Fothergil. Fs operation.# Woman > 40 yrs with completed family & not desirous of keeping childbreaing and menstrual function = Vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair.# Older women who are no longer sexually active = Le Fort's operation. A prolapse into the upper barrel of the vagina is called first degree. If the prolapse is through the vaginal barrel to the region of the introitus, it is second degree. If the cervix and uterus prolapse out through the introitus, it is called third degree or total. In total prolapse the vagina is everted around the uterus and cervix and completely exteriorized. When this occurs, the patient is in danger of developing dryness, thickening, and chronic inflammation of the vaginal epithelium. Stasis ulcers may result as edema and interference with blood supply to vaginal wall occur. These ulcers rarely become cancerous. The treatment for prolapse is: Conservative management of prolapse usually involves fitting the patient with a pessary. A. Conservative: Abdominal and perineal exercises, massage vaginal pessary. Asymptomatic prolapse does not need treatment. An exception is a woman with stress incontinence and prolapse who is about to undergo surgical bladder neck suspension. Symptomatic prolapse can be treated conservatively or surgically, depending on the individual. Pelvic muscle exercises may be of benefit to women with stress incontinence. B. Surgical: Vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair. Anterior colporrhaphy. Posterior colporraphy and colpoperineorrhaphy. Fotehrgill's repair (Manchester operation). Shirodkar's procedure. Leforf s repair. Abdominal sling operations. Operations for Vaginal Prolapse. Vaginal Hysterectomy: Operative repair for prolapse of the uterus and cervix generally involves a vaginal hysterectomy with anterior and posterior colporrhaphy. The advantage of vaginal hysterectomy is that it allows other vaginal surgery (e. g., anterior and posterior colporrhaphy or enterocele repair) to be performed at the same time, without the need for a separate incision or for repositioning the patient. F other gill Operation: This operation combines an anterior and posterior colporrhaphy with the amputation of the cervix and the use of the cardinal ligaments to support the anterior vaginal wall and bladder. In this operation, the bladder is dissected off the cervix, which is then amputated. The cardinal ligaments are sewn to the anterior cervical stump, and the posterior vagina is closed over the rest of the opening. This operation is usually performed in conjunction with an anteroposterior colporrhaphy, and it is usually done for the sake of expediency in patients who are poor surgical risks and who do not desire future fertility. The loss of the cervix may interfere with fertility or lead to incompetence of the internal cervical os. The operation has value in older women who have an elongated cervix and well-supported uterus because it is technically easier and has a shorter operative time. Manchester/Fothergill Operation -Operation of choice in third degree prolapse of uterus in patients who are poor surgical risks and who do not desire future fertility. Uteropexy (Abdominal sling operation): In a young nullipara who desires to retain her fertility. If prolapse cannot be managed successfully with a pessary, such patients present a surgical challenge. The older abdominal uterine suspension operations (Baldy-Webster, Gilliam, ven- trofixation, or hysteropexy) do not work for patients with significant uterine prolapse. Abdominal sling operations include:# Abdominocervicopexy# Shirodker's abdominal sling operation# Khanna abdominal sling operation. Paravaginal Defect Repair Operation: Anterior vaginal prolapse has been treated with anterior colporrhaphy, plicating the endopelvic fascia in the midline under the bladder neck. If the anterior vaginal prolapse results from a lateral detachment of the endopelvic fascia from the lateral pelvic sidewall, however, better results will be obtained by performing a lateral repair. In this technique, the endopelvic fascia is reattached to the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis through what is referred to as a paravaginal defect repair operation. Posterior Colporrhaphy: Repair of posterior vaginal prolapse for rectocele and enterocele is also performed vaginally using posterior colporrhaphy. In a rectocele repair, the posterior vagina is opened, the rectum is dissected away from the pararectal fascia, and the levator ani muscles are plicated over the rectum in the midline, after which the vaginal epithelium is closed. Because of concern over postoperative dyspareunia, recent modifications of posterior colporrhaphy have included site-specific repair. Le Fort's operation. In older women who are no longer sexually active a simple procedure for reducing prolapse is a partial colpocleisis. The classic procedure was described by Le Fortand involves the removal of a strip of anterior and posterior vaginal wall, with closure of the margins of the anterior and posterior wall to each other. The Goodall-Power modification of the Le Fort operation allows for the removal of a triangular piece of vaginal wall beginning at the cervical reflection or 1 cm above the vaginal scar at the base of the triangle, with the apex of the triangle just beneath the bladder neck anteriorly and just at the introitus posteriorly. This procedure works well for relatively small prolapses, whereas the Le Fort is best for larger ones.",

Thromboembolic disease* OCP do not act by interference with placental functioning* Contraceptive of choice for Rheumatic heart disease is Barrier method (condom)* Ideal contraceptive for newly married couple is combined OCP* Ideal contraceptive for a couple living in different cities meeting only occasionally - Barrier method* Best contraceptive for parous young women- IUCD* Progesterone of choice in emergency contraceptive is Levonorgestrel*** Effective life of device - Nova Cu-T (5 years) Multiload Cu-T 375 (5years) Cu-T 380A (10 years)* OCP should be avoided in patients on antiepileptic medication* The risk of chlamydial infections is increased in patients using OCP. In most patients such chlamydial infection is asymptomatic. Azithromycin is drug of choice in chlaraydial infection in pregnancy* Fishy vaginal odor is most characteristic of Bacterial vaginosis due to Gardnella viginalis (Gram negative bacilli, decreased number of lactobacilli, clue cells, few leucocytes (polymorphs), PH of discharge is >4. 5)",

UNIQUE COMPLICATIONSMONOAMNIONIC TWINSApproximately 1 percent of monozygotic twins are monoamnionic. A high fetal death rate is associated with this rare variety of monozygotic twinning. Intertwining of their umbilical cords, a common cause of death, is estimated to complicate at least half of cases. DISCORDANT TWINSThe cause of birthweight inequality in twin fetuses is often unclear, but evidence indicates that etiology in monochorionic twins differs from that in dichorionic twins. ACARDIAC TWINTwin reversed-arterial-perfusion (TRAP) sequence is a rare (1 in 35, 000 births) but serious complication of monochorionic, monozygotic multiple gestation. CONJOINED TWINSThe majority are of the thoracopagus. Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome. In this syndrome, blood is transfused from a donor twin to its recipient sibling such that the donor becomes anemic and its growth may be restricted, whereas the recipient becomes polycythemic and may develop circulatory overload manifest as hydrops. The donor twin is pale, and its recipient sibling is plethoric. Seen in Monochorionic twin. Overview of the incidence of twin pregnancy Zygosity & corresponding twin-specific complications.
