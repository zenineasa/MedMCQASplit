        "question": "Morula period is a ----- cell stage",
        "exp": "After feilization, the zygote is a diploid cell with 46 chromosomes, undergoes cleavage, and zygote cells produced by this division are called blastomeres. As the blastomeres continue to divide, a solid mulberry-like ball of cells, the morula is produced. The morula enters the uterine cavity about 3 days after feilization. The gradual accumulation of fluid between the morula cells leads to the formation of the early blastocyst. The morula period begins at the 12- to 16cell stage and ends when the blastocyst forms, which occurs when there are 50 to 60 blastomeres present.
