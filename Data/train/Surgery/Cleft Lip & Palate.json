Ideal time for the repair of cleft palate is 6-18 months of age. Best choice among the given options is 9-12 months. 'Cleft lip repair is commonly performed between 3 and 6 months of age whereas cleft palate repair is frequently performed between 6 and 18 months. - Bailey 26/e 638. Surgical closure of a cleft lip is usually performed by 3 months of age. when the infant has shown satisfactory weight gain and is free of any oral, respiratory: or systemic infection. Z-plasty is the most commonly used technique; a staggered suture line minimizes notching of the lip from retraction of scar tissue. The initial repair may be revised at 4 or 5 year of age. In an otherwise healthy child, closure of the palate is usually done before 1 year of age to enhance normal speech development. ' - Nelson 19/e p1252-1253. Cleft Lip and Palate. Clefts of the lip, alveolus and hard and soft palate are the MC congenital abnormalities of the orofacial structuresQ. Frequently occur as isolated deformities but can be associated with other medical conditions, particularly congenital heart diseaseQ. Incomplete clefts affect only a portion of the lip and contain a bridge of tissue connecting the central and lateral lip elements, referred to as Simonart's bandQ. Cleft lip is due to non-fusion of maxillary process with medial nasal processQ. Unilateral cleft lip is associated with posterior displacement of alar cartilage. QIncidence: Highest incidence reported for cleft lip and palate occurs in the Indian tribes of Montana, USA (1: 276). Cleft lip/palate predominates in males. QCleft palate alone appears to be more common in femalesQ. Incidence of cleft lip and palate is 1: 600 live births. QIncidence of isolated cleft palate is 1: 1000 live births. QDistribution: In unilateral cleft lip the deformity affects the left sideQ in 60% of cases. Typical distribution of cleft types. Cleft lip alone: 15%Cleft lip and palate: 45% (MC)QIsolated cleft palate: 40%Etiology of cleft lip and palate. Etiology of cleft lip and palate: Genetic predisposition and a contributory environmental componentQ. Environmental factors: Maternal epilepsyQ and drugs (steroids, diazepam and phenytoinQ). Associated syndromes: Although most clefts of the lip and palate occur as an isolated deformity, Pierre Robin sequence remains the most common syndromeQ. Other associated syndromes: Stickler's (ophthalmic and musculoskeletal abnormalities), Shprintzen's (cardiac anomalies), Down's, Apert's and Treacher-Collins'syndromes. Types of Cleft lip. Types of Cleft palate* Unilateral deft lip* Bilateral deft lip* Incomplete: Cleft of the hard palate remains attached to the nasal septum and vomerQ* Complete: Nasal septum and vomer are completely separated from the palatine processes. QAntenatal diagnosis: All but isolated cleft palate can be diagnosed by ultrasound after 18 weeksQ gestation. Problems immediately after birth: Some babies are able to feed normally but some will need assistance. Breathing problems in Pierre Robin sequence may be life threatening. Management: Surgical techniques are aimed at restoring normal anatomy. Cleft lip* Repaired between 3-6 months of age. QCleft palate* Repaired between 6-18 months of age. QPrinciples of surgery: Cleft lip surgery attaches and reconnects the muscles around the oral sphincter. QCleft palate surgery aims to bring together mucosa and muscles with minimal scarring. QTwo-stage procedures attempt to minimize dissection. QSecondary Management: Following primary surgery, regular review by a multidisciplinary team is essentialQ. Many aspects of cleft care require long-term review: Hearing, speech, dental development, facial growthQ. Timing of Primary Cleft Lip and Palate Procedures (after Delaire). Cleft lip alone.
