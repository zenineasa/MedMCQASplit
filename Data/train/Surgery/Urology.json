The relative youthfulness of the patient often rules out prostatic enlargement, which characteristically occurs after the age of 50. As the stream becomes narrower, micturition is prolonged and is followed by postmicturition dribbling as a result of urine trickling from the dilated urethra proximal to the stricture. Urinary frequency by day and night is common and is due to incomplete bladder emptying, coexisting detrusor overactivity or urinary infection. If the stricture is tight enough, the patient will go into acute retention, although this is rare. If this happens, there is a danger that clumsy attempts to pass a urethral catheter will result in a false passage. If a patient has gone into retention because of a urethral stricture, its lumen will be too narrow to pass even a tiny catheter and suprapubic catheterisation is required. Investigation involves uroflowmetry, urethroscopy, urethrography and ultrasound scanning to assess bladder emptying and to detect any upper tract dilatation. The urinary flow rate is typically prolonged and plateau shaped while urethroscopy allows the stricture to be viewedas a circumferential scar. Openings of false passages commemorate previous misguided attempts to pass a urethral catheter. Urethrography using a water-soluble contrast medium will show the extent and severity of the stricture Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 1482",

        "exp": "Osteosarcoma An osteosarcoma (OS) or osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) (or simply bone cancer) is a cancerous tumor in a bone. Specifically, it is an aggressive malignant neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces malignant osteoid. Treatment A complete radical, surgical, en bloc resection of the cancer, is the treatment of choice in osteosarcoma. Although about 90% of patients are able to have limb-salvage surgery, complications, paicularly infection, prosthetic loosening and non-union, or local tumor recurrence may cause the need for fuher surgery or amputation. Mifamuide is used after a patient has had surgery to remove the tumor and together with chemotherapy to kill remaining cancer cells to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Also, the option to have rotationplasty after the tumor is taken out exists. Patients with osteosarcoma are best managed by a medical oncologist and an ohopedic oncologist experienced in managing sarcomas. Current standard treatment is to use neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given before surgery) followed by surgical resection. The percentage of tumor cell necrosis (cell death) seen in the tumor after surgery gives an idea of the prognosis and also lets the oncologist know if the chemotherapy regimen should be altered after surgery. Standard therapy is a combination of limb-salvage ohopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-aerial cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide with mesna, BCD (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin), etoposide, and muramyl tripeptide. Rotationplasty may be used. Ifosfamide can be used as an adjuvant treatment if the necrosis rate is low. Despite the success of chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, it has one of the lowest survival rates for pediatric cancer. The best repoed 10-year survival rate is 92%; the protocol used is an aggressive intra-aerial regimen that individualizes therapy based on aeriographic response. Three-year event-free survival ranges from 50% to 75%, and five-year survival ranges from 60% to 85+% in some studies. Overall, 65-70% patients treated five years ago will be alive today. These survival rates are overall averages and vary greatly depending on the individual necrosis rate. Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim help with white blood cell counts and neutrophil counts. Blood transfusions and epoetin alfa help with anemia. Computational analysis on a panel of Osteosarcoma cell lines identified new shared and specific therapeutic targets (proteomic and genetic) in Osteosarcoma, while phenotypes showed an increased role of tumor microenvironments Ref: Internet sources",

VUR occurs in 1-2% of the asymptomatic paediatric population but in 30-40% of children with a UTI and is apparent in 90% of children with renal scarring on an IVU. VUR is graded as follows: Grade I: reflux into the ureter. Grade II: reflux into the ureter and renal pelvis. Grade III: reflux is associated with mild/moderate dilatation on an IVU. Grade IV: additional blunting of fornices. Grade V: absent papillary impressions. Grades I-III generally resolve spontaneously. Surgery (ureteric re-implantation, periureteric injections of Teflon or collagen) should be considered if episodes of acute PN recur despite antibiotic therapy or if severe reflux is accompanied by a surgically correctable malformation.

These autogenous fistulae are always the first choice as they are likely to work longer and require less maintenance to keep them going. It is best to create a fistula as close to the hand as possible so that a long length of the vein in the forearm and arm is available for dialysis. If it is not possible to establish either of these types of fistula, access may be established using either a transposed brachial-basilic vein fistula or an AV graft of synthetic material ( e. g., polytetrafluoroethylene ). The preferred site and type of graft is a forearm curved looped radiocephalic graft. This is followed by an upper arm straight graft. The least preferred sites and type of grafts are forearm straight radial cephalic and looped thigh grafts. However, the location for the graft placement is determined by each patient's unique anatomical restrictions, previous access history, and the surgeon's skill.",

Psychosexual dysfunction in such patients may be the underlying problem. The diagnosis of chronic prostatitis has to be based on: * persistent threads in voided urine; * prostatic massage showing pus cells with or without bacte ria in the absence of urinary infection. Aetiology This is thought to be the sequela of inadequately treated acute prostatitis. While pus is present in the prostatic secretion, the responsible organism is often difficult to find. Other organisms such as Chlamydia species may be responsible for chronic abacterial prostatitis. Clinical features The clinical features are extremely varied. Only men with symptoms of posterior urethritis, prostatic pain and perigen ital pain accompanied by intermittent fever and pus cells or bacteria in the post-prostatic massage specimen should be diagnosed as having chronic prostatitis. Diagnosis The three-glass urine test is valuable. If the first glass with the initial voided sample shows urine containing prostatic threads, prostatitis is present. Rectal examination of the prostate may be normal or may show a soft, boggy and tender prostate. Examination of the prostatic fluid obtained by prostatic massage should show pus cells and bacteria. Urethroscopy may reveal inflammation of the prostatic urethra, and pus may be seen exuding from the prostatic ducts. The verumontanum is likely to be enlarged and oedematous. In many men with the symptoms described above, all investi gations are normal. Treatment Antibiotic therapy should be administered only in accordance with bacteriological sensitivity tests. Trimethoprim or ciprofloxacin penetrate well into the prostate. If Trichomonas or anaerobes are the responsible agent, a rapid response is obtained from administration of metronidazole (200mg t. d. s. for 7 days to both paners). Treatment is continued upto 10-12 weeks. If Chlamydia is suspected, doxycycline is the antibiotic treatment of choice. There is little evidence that prostatic massage helps in eradicating the infection. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 1475",

The absence of ganglion cells is due to a failure of migration of vagal neural crest cells into the developing gut. The affected gut is in spasm, causing a functional bowel obstruction. The aganglionosis is restricted to the rectum and sigmoid colon in 75% of patients (sho segment), involves the proximal colon in 15% (long segment) and affects the entire colon and a poion of terminal ileum in 10% (total colonic aganglionosis). A transition zone exists between the dilated, proximal, normally innervated bowel and the narrow, distal aganglionic segment. Hirschsprung's disease may be familial or associated with Down syndrome or other genetic disorders. Gene mutations have been identified on chromosome 10 (involving the RET proto-oncogene) and on chromosome 13 in some patients. Hirschsprung's disease typically presents in the neonatal period with delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension and bilious vomiting but it may not be diagnosed until later in childhood or even adult life, when it manifests as severe chronic constipation. Enterocolitis is a potentially fatal complication. The diagnosis requires an adequate rectal biopsy and an experienced pathologist. A contrast enema may show the narrow aganglionic segment, a cone and the dilated proximal bowel. Surgery aims to remove the aganglionic segment and 'pull-through' ganglionic bowel to the anus (e. g. Swenson, Duhamel, Soave and transanal procedures), and can be done in a single stage or in stages after first establishing a proximal stoma in normally innervated bowel. Most patients achieve good bowel control but a significant minority experience residual constipation and/or faecal incontinence or fuher enterocolitis. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 136",

There is no single therapeutic agent that can relieve symptoms Endoscopic, radiological or surgical interventions are indicated mainly to relieve obstruction of the pancreatic duct, bile duct or the duodenum, or in dealing with complications (e. g. pseudocyst, abscess, fistula, ascites or variceal haemorrhage). Decompressing an obstructed pancreatic duct can provide pain relief in some patients (the assumption is that ductal hypertension causes the pain). Endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy might be beneficial in patients with papillary stenosis and a high sphincter pressure and pancreatic ductal pressure. Patients with a dominant pancreatic duct stricture and upstream dilatation may benefit by placement of a stent across the stricture. The stent should be left in for no more than 4-6 weeks as it will block. The complication rate is high, and less than two-thirds of patients experience pain relief, but those who do get relief may benefit from a surgical bypass. Pancreatic duct stones maybe extracted at ERCP, and this may sometimes be combined with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Pseudocysts may be drained internally under EUS guidance. Percutaneous or transgastric drainage of pseudocysts under ultrasound or CT guidance may be performed. The role of surgery is to overcome obstruction and remove mass lesions. Some patients have a mass in the head of the pancreas, for which either a pancreatoduodenectomy or a Beger procedure (duodenum-preserving resection of the pancreatic head) is appropriate. If the duct is markedly dilated, then a longitudinal pancreatojejunostomy or Frey procedure can be of value. The natural evolution of the disease may not be altered significantly, but around half the patients get long-term pain relief. The rare patient with disease limited to the tail will be cured by a distal pancreatectomy. Patients with intractable pain and diffuse disease may plead for a total pancreatectomy in the expectation that removing the offending organ will relieve their pain. How- ever, one should keep in mind that pancreatic function and quality of life are significantly impaired after this procedure, and the operative moality rate is not tril. Moreover, there is no guarantee of pain relief (approximately a third of patients get resolution, a third show some benefit, and a third see no benefit at all). Total pancreatectomy and islet auto- transplantation has been repoed in selected patients, but it is difficult to demonstrate any overall benefit. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 1231",

It should be undeaken only after the couple has been carefully counselled. Both paners need to know that the operation is performed to make the man permanently sterile. They should be warned that normal contraceptive precautions should continue until the success of the operation is confirmed by semen analysis performed 12-16 weeks after surgery. They should also be warned of the possibility of spontaneous recanalisation, which may restore feility unexpectedly and of the possibility of chronic testicular pain that may occur in up to 5% of men. Vasectomy is easily and painlessly performed under local anaesthetic. The vasa are delivered through tiny bilateral scrotal incisions or through a single midline scrotal incision. For medico-legal reasons it is wise to remove a segment of each vas to prove that it has been successfully divided. Burying the cut ends, fascial interposition or turning them back on themselves helps to prevent them rejoining. Reversal of vasectomy may not restore feility even if the surgery is technically successful because of damage to the testis secondary to the vasectomy. Although patency rates of 80% or more are commonly repoed, successful feility rates are much lower, and diminish with increasing delay from the time of vasectomy.

        "exp": "DAMAGE CONTROL SURGERY (Abbreted laparotomy) Following major injury, protracted surgery in the physiologically unstable patient can in itself prove fatal. Patients with the 'deadly triad' (hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy) are those at highest risk. 'Damage control' or 'damage limitation surgery' is a concept that originated from naval ship- building strategy, whereby ships were designed so that the damage was kept 'local' and which allowed only the minimal repairs needed to prevent it from sinking, while definitive repairs waited until it had reached po. The technique has been adopted following major trauma, and includes initial care and resuscitation (damage control resuscitation) and the surgical correction of the injury (damage control surgery). The minimum amount of surgery needed to stabilise the patient's condition may be the safest course until the physiological derangement can be corrected. Damage control surgery is restricted to only two goals: * stopping any active surgical bleeding; * controlling any contamination. Once these goals have been achieved then the operation is suspended and the abdomen temporarily closed. The patient's resuscitation then continues in the intensive care unit, where other therapeutic interventions can take place. Once the physiology has been corrected, the patient warmed and the coagulopathy corrected, the patient is returned to the operating theatre for any definitive surgery. Indications for Damage control surgery Anatomical Inability to achieve haemostasis Complex abdominal injury, e. g. liver and pancreas Combined vascular, solid and hollow organ injury, e. g. aoic or caval injury Inaccessible major venous injury, e. g. retrohepatic vena cava Demand for non-operative control of other injuries, e. g. fractured pelvis Anticipated need for a time-consuming procedure Physiological (decline of physiological reserve) Temperature <34oC pH <7. 2 Serum lactate >5 mmol/L (normal: <2. 5 mmol/L) Prothrombin time (PT) >16 s Paial thromboplastin time (PTT) >60 s >10 units blood transfused Systolic blood pressure <90 mm.

        "exp": "Wound healing is delayed in patients who are malnourished, or have vitamin A and C deficiency. Steroids also inhibit the adequate healing of wounds as they inhibit protein synthesis and fibroblast proliferation. Poorly-controlled diabetes delays wound healing and increases the risk of infection at the surgical site. Wound Healing This is variously described as taking place in three or four phases, the most commonly agreed being: the inflammatory phase; the proliferative phase; the remodelling phase (maturing phase). Occasionally, a haemostatic phase is referred to as occurring before the inflammatory phase, or a destructive phase following inflammation consisting of the cellular cleansing of the wound by macrophages The inflammatory phase begins immediately after wounding and lasts 2-3 days. Bleeding is followed by vasoconstriction and thrombus formation to limit blood loss. Platelets stick to the damaged endothelial lining of vessels, releasing adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which causes thrombocytic aggregates to fill the wound. When bleeding stops, the platelets then release several cytokines from their alpha granules. These are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), platelet factor IV and transforming growth factor beta (TGFb). These attract inflammatory cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and macrophages. Platelets and the local injured tissue release vasoactive amines, such as histamine, serotonin and prostaglandins, which increase vascular permeability, thereby aiding infiltration of these inflammatory cells. Macrophages remove devitalised tissue and microorganisms while regulating fibroblast activity in the proliferative phase of healing. The initial framework for structural suppo of cells is provided by fibrin produced by fibrinogen. A more historical (Latin) description of this phase is described in four words: rubor (redness), tumor (swelling), calor (heat) and dolor (pain). The proliferative phase lasts from the third day to the third week, consisting mainly of fibroblast activity with the production of collagen and ground substance (glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans), the growth of new blood vessels as capillary loops (angioneogenesis) and the re-epithelialisation of the wound surface. Fibroblasts require vitamin C to produce collagen. The wound tissue formed in the early pa of this phase is called granulation tissue. In the latter pa of this phase, there is an increase in the tensile strength of the wound due to increased collagen, which is at first deposited in a random fashion and consists of type III collagen. This proliferative phase with its increase of collagen deposition is associated with wound contraction, which can considerably reduce the surface area of a wound over the first 3 weeks of healing. The remodelling phase is characterised by maturation of collagen (type I replacing type III until a ratio of 4: 1 is achieved). There is a realignment of collagen fibres along the lines of tension, decreased wound vascularity, and wound contraction due to fibroblast and myofibroblast activity. This maturation of collagen leads to increased tensile strength in the wound which is maximal at the 12th week post injury and represents approximately 80% of the uninjured skin strength.

        "exp": "GENERAL POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS Bleeding Postoperative haemorrhage is most common in the immediate postoperative period. It may be caused by an aerial or venous leak, but also by a generalised ooze or a coagulopathy. Slow bleeds may go undetected for hours and then the patient suddenly decompensates. All patients must have their vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure, oximetry, central venous pressure, if available, and urine output) monitored regularly. Dressings and drains should be inspected regularly in the first 24 hours after surgery. If haemorrhage is suspected, blood samples should be taken for a full blood count, coagulation profile and cross match. A large bore intravenous cannula should be sitedand fluid resuscitation commenced. If the source of bleeding is in doubt and the patient is stable, an ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan may be required to determine the nature of the bleed (most commonly if a haematoma is suspected in the days following surgery). If the patient's cardiovascular system is unstable or compromised in any way (for example neck haematoma or bleeding tonsil) they should be taken back to the operating theatre immediately. The treatment of haemorrhage is both to stop the bleeding and suppoive. Suppoive treatment includes oxygen and fluid resuscitation. It may require correction of coagulopathy. All patients will require close observation. Blood transfusion carries risks (acute haemolytic transfusion reaction, sensitisation, fluid overload, hyperkalaemia, transfusion-related lung injury and transmission of blood-borne infection). There is much published about what is the right transfusion trigger and how to balance the need for adequate tissue perfusion and the risks of transfusion. The decision about when to transfuse should be based on the individual patient; in general, however, the accepted transfusion trigger is 75 g/L except in the presence of known or suspected coronary aery disease when a higher trigger is acceptable. All hospitals should have a 'major haemorrhage protocol' in place. The consultant surgeon, anaesthetist and haematologist should all be involved early on in the care of unstable patients.

Recipients at most risk from CMV infection are those who are CMV seronegative and receive an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor (about half of all UK donors are CMV seropositive). CMV disease typically presents at 4-8 weeks with a high swinging fever, lethargy and leukopenia. The severity of the disease is variable and the clinical picture depends on the organ system most affected. It may present as: pneumonia, gastrointestinal disease, hepatitis, retinitis, encephalitis. Severe CMV disease is potentially fatal. Prophylaxis for CMV consists of administration of antiviral agents but less effective alternatives.

According to this theory, the prostate enlarges because of increased oestrogenic effects. It is likely that the secretion of intermediate peptide growth factors plays a pa in the development of BPH Pathology BPH affects both glandular epithelium and connective tissue stroma to variable degrees. These changes are similar to those occurring in breast dysplasia, in which adenosis, epitheliosis and stromal proliferation are seen in differing propoions. BPH typically affects the submucous group of glands in the transitional zone, forming a nodular enlargement. Eventually, this overgrowth compresses the PZ glands into a false capsule and causes the appearance of the typical 'lateral' lobes. When BPH affects the subcervical CZ glands, a 'middle' lobe develops that projects up into the bladder within the internal sphincter. Sometimes, both lateral lobes also project into the bladder, so that when viewed from within, the sides and back of the internal urinary meatus are surrounded by an intravesical prostatic collar.

The ectopic ureter drains the upper pole of the kidney and inses into the bladder more distally than normal and towards the bladder neck. In females, the ectopic ureter opens either into the urethra below the sphincter or into the vagina. A female who voids normally but who has dribbled urine for as long as she can remember is typical of the patient with an ectopic ureter. In the male, the opening of the ureter is above the external urethral sphincter so the patient is continent. An ectopic ureteric orifice in a male at the apex of the trigone, in the posterior urethra, in a seminal vesicle or in an ejaculatory duct is likely to be functionally abnormal and infection is common. A severely diseased or atrophic moiety is effectively treated by paial nephrectomy. A refluxing ureter may need re-implanting. An ectopic ureter in a female often drains hydronephrotic and chronically infected renal tissue and is best excised. Rarely, the incontinence can be cured and renal function preserved by re-implanting the ureter into the bladder. ( ref: Bailey 27 th ed, chapter 76, pg 1401 )",

Autonomic neuropathy may be seen with: Alcohol abuse Diabetes (diabetic neuropathy) Disorders involving scarring of tissues around the nerves Guillain Barre syndrome or other diseases that inflame nerves HIV/AIDS Inherited nerve disorders Multiple sclerosis Parkinson disease Spinal cord injury Surgery or injury involving the nerves Symptoms Signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy depend on the nerves affected. They might include: Dizziness and fainting when standing, caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure (ohostatic hypertension). Urinary problems, such as difficulty staing urination, incontinence, difficulty sensing a full bladder and inability to completely empty the bladder, which can lead to urinary tract infections. Sexual difficulties, including problems achieving or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) or ejaculation problems in men. In women, problems include vaginal dryness, low libido and difficulty reaching orgasm. Difficulty digesting food, such as feeling full after a few bites of food, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and heaburn, all due to changes in digestive function. Inability to recognize low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), because the warning signals, such as getting shaky, aren't there.

CT has the following advantages over IVU: it has higher sensitivity and specificity for calculus detection, it does not use intravenous contrast medium, it permits alternative diagnoses, and requires a shoer examination time. CT can visualise all radiopaque stones, as well as radiolucent stones such as uric acid and cystine calculi. An impoant limitation of CT is the fact that it does not permit functional evaluation of the kidneys and it is unable to assess the degree of obstruction.

        "exp": "Permanent urinary tract diversion is most commonly performed by conduit diversion. The ureters are implanted into a sho, isolated segment of ileum or, less commonly, colon. The conduit dives the urine onwards to a cutaneous stoma for collection in an ileostomy bag. Ileal segment is the best for urinary diversion after cystectomy. Still better method is \"Continent cutaneous diversion\" method. But the best method is \"Ohotopic neobladders\". \"Incontinent cutaneous urinary diversion\" by ileal conduit: a segment of ileum is exteriorized in the form of a stoma through the abdominal wall, around which an appliance is secured and into which urine continuously drains. \"Continent cutaneous diversions\" -- All continent cutaneous reservoirs rely upon a low-pressure pouch constructed of various detubularized bowel segments and a functional mechanism that connects the reservoir to the skin, designed to prevent involuntary urine flow. The most obvious advantages of this type of diversion are the ability to avoid continuous urine drainage and the need for an external appliance. These continent cutaneous diversions require intermittent clean self-catheterization through the stoma both to empty the reservoir and to irrigate mucous. No stomal appliance is usually required. Although continent cutaneous diversions have been largely supplanted by the ohotopic neobladder, this procedure is used when the urethra or bladder neck is non-functional or involved by tumor, and avoidance of an external appliance is desired. \"Ohotropic neobladders\"-- Ohotropic neobladders are internal reservoirs that are connected to the native urethra and rely upon the external striated sphincter for continence. These reservoirs are constructed from a segment of detubularized intestine (usually ileum) anastomosed to the native urinary outflow tract. Because this approach facilitates the restoration of normal self-image by approximating normal voiding, construction of an ohotropic neobladder has become the procedure of choice for most patients following cystectomy for bladder cancer in both men and women. It is contraindicated if the urethra is nonfunctional or involved with tumor. Bailey and Love Pg: 1336",

CT can visualise all radiopaque stones, as well as radiolucent stones such as uric acid and cystine calculi. An impoant limitation of CT is the fact that it does not permit functional evaluation of the kidneys and it is unable to assess the degree of obstruction. Another disadvantage is higher radiation exposure of the patient compared with KUB or IVU. ref:- Bailey and Love 27th ed, chapter 76, pg no:- 1406 Campbell - Walsh urology 11th ed, chapter 52, pg no 1202",

Patients with the 'deadly triad' (hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy) are those at highest risk. 'Damage control' or 'damage limitation surgery' is a concept that originated from naval ship- building strategy, whereby ships were designed so that the damage was kept 'local' and which allowed only the minimal repairs needed to prevent it from sinking, while definitive repairs waited until it had reached po. The technique has been adopted following major trauma, and includes initial care and resuscitation (damage control resuscitation) and the surgical correction of the injury (damage control surgery). The minimum amount of surgery needed to stabilise the patient's condition may be the safest course until the physiological derangement can be corrected. Damage control surgery is restricted to only two goals: * stopping any active surgical bleeding; * controlling any contamination. Once these goals have been achieved then the operation is suspended and the abdomen temporarily closed. The patient's resuscitation then continues in the intensive care unit, where other therapeutic interventions can take place. Once the physiology has been corrected, the patient warmed and the coagulopathy corrected, the patient is returned to the operating theatre for any definitive surgery. Indications for Damage control surgery Anatomical Inability to achieve haemostasis Complex abdominal injury, e. g. liver and pancreas Combined vascular, solid and hollow organ injury, e. g. aoic or caval injury Inaccessible major venous injury, e. g. retrohepatic vena cava Demand for non-operative control of other injuries, e. g. fractured pelvis Anticipated need for a time-consuming procedure Physiological (decline of physiological reserve) Temperature <34oC pH <7. 2 Serum lactate >5 mmol/L (normal: <2. 5 mmol/L) Prothrombin time (PT) >16 s Paial thromboplastin time (PTT) >60 s >10 units blood transfused Systolic blood pressure <90 mm.

        "exp": "Next line of management is CFTR gene mutation analysis MALE FACTOR INFEILITY For couples of unknown feility status, approximately 15% are unable to achieve a pregnancy within 1 year. The inability to conceive may be due to female factor infeility, male factor infeility or a combination of these two factors and approximately 20% of cases of infeility are caused entirely by the male factor. Aetiology The two main causes of male factor infeility are either primary testicular causes or obstruction at the level of either the vas or the epididymis. A few cases reflect endocrinological abnormalities such as hypogonadism or hyperprolactinaemia. Testicular causes include chromosomal problems (e. g. Klinefelter's syndrome), microdeletions of the Y chromosome, cryptorchidism, mumps orchitis, drugs and radiation damage. In most cases however, the cause is unclear. In these cases, there may be reduced numbers of sperm in the ejaculate (oligozoospermia) or a complete absence of sperm in the ejaculate (azoospermia). Obstructive causes include congenital absence of the vasa (often in association with cystic fibrosis), surgical damage to the vasa and epididymitis. Azoospermia is inevitable in these cases. Assessment and investigation Given the interplay between male and female factors, the man should not be investigated in isolation from his female paner. A careful history is the mainstay of the assessment with a careful search for aetiological factors. Physical examination is usually normal, but occasionally the testes may feel small (suggestive of a testicular cause), the vasa may be absent, there may be evidence of endocrine abnormalities(gynaecomastia or abnormal hair distribution) or there may be a varicocoele. The relation of any varicocoele to the infeility is controversial and treatment is not usually indicated. The woman should be also be assessed. It is impoant to remember that female feility declines from the age of 35 years in a way that is not true of men. The age of the woman is therefore impoant and the regularity of menstruation should be confirmed either by temperature testing or by endocrinological testing. The assessment of the man includes semen analysis, which should be tested within 2 hours of the semen being produced. Two or three samples should be tested. The volume of the ejaculate, the numbers of sperm, their motility and the percentage of abnormal or damaged sperm are all predictive of male feility. An endocrine screen should be performed including serum testosterone, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH). Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 1511",

Most vesical calculi are formed de novo within the bladder, but some initially may have formed within the kidneys as a dissociated Randall plaque or on a sloughed papilla and subsequently may have passed into the bladder, where additional deposition of crystals cause the stone to grow. * Most renal stones that are small enough to pass through the ureters are also small enough to pass through a normally functioning bladder and an unobstructed urethra. * In older men with bladder stones composed of uric acid, the stone most likely formed in the bladder.* Stones composed of calcium oxalate are usually initially formed in the kidney.* In adults, MC type of vesical stone (seen in >50% of cases) is composed of uric acid. * Less frequently, bladder calculi are composed of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, ammonium urate, cystine, or magnesium ammonium phosphate (when associated with infection). Endemic Bladder Calculi * In children, stones are composed mainly of ammonium acid urate, calcium oxalate, or an impure mixture of ammonium acid urate and calcium oxalate with calcium phosphate.* The common link among endemic areas relates to feeding infants human breast milk and polished rice.* These foods are low in phosphorus, ultimately leading to high ammonia excretion.* These children also usually have a high intake of oxalate-rich vegetables (increased oxalate crystalluria) and animal protein (low dietary citrate). * Vesical calculi may be single or multiple, especially in the presence of bladder diveicula, and can be small or large enough to occupy the entire bladder. They range from soft to extremely hard, with surfaces ranging from smooth and faceted to jagged and spiculated (\"jack\" stones). * Most bladder stones are secondary, more common in older males (>50 years), usually because of bladder outlet obstruction.* MC type: Uric acid (sterile urine) > Struvite stones (Infected urine)* Bladder stones are usually solitary, multiple in 25% patients. Etiology* Bladder outlet obstruction (MC cause)* Neurogenic bladder* Foreign body (Foley's catheter, forgotten DJ stents)* Bladder diveicula. Clinical Features* Typical symptoms are intermittent, painful voiding and terminal hematuria with severe pain at the end of micturition.* Pain may be referred to the tip of the penis or to the labia majora.

        "question": "Most common complication seen with prostatitis is",
        "exp": "PROSTATITIS In both acute and chronic prostatitis, the seminal vesicles and posterior urethra are usually also involved. Acute prostatitis Aetiology Acute prostatitis is common, but underdiagnosed. The usual organism responsible is Escherichia coli, but Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus faecalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia may be responsible. The infection may be haematogenous from a distant focus or it may be secondary to acute urinary infection. Clinical features General manifestations overshadow the local: the patient feels ill, shivers, may have a rigor, has 'aches' all over, especially in the back, and may easily be diagnosed as having influenza. The temperature may be up to 39degC. Pain on micturition is usual, but not invariable. The urine contains threads in the initial voided sample, which should be cultured. Perineal heaviness, rectal irritation and pain on defaecation can occur; a urethral discharge is rare. Frequency occurs when the infection involves the bladder. Rectal examination reveals a tender prostate; one lobe may be swollen more than the other, and the seminal vesicles may be involved. A frankly fluctuant hygiene abscess is uncommon. Treatment Treatment must be rigorous and prolonged or the infection will not be eradicated and recurrent attacks may ensue. Spread of infection to the epididymides and testes may occur. Prolonged treatment with an antibiotic that penetrates the prostate well is indicated (trimethoprim or ciprofloxacin) Chronic prostatitis Many urologists find the diagnosis of chronic prostatitis and 'prostatodynia' very difficult, for many men present with perigenital pain, testicular pain, prostatic pain exacerbated by sexual intercourse or pain that apparently renders sexual intercourse out of the question. Psychosexual dysfunction in such patients may be the underlying problem. The diagnosis of chronic prostatitis has to be based on: * persistent threads in voided urine; * prostatic massage showing pus cells with or without bacteria in the absence of urinary infection. Aetiology This is thought to be the sequela of inadequately treated acute prostatitis. While pus is present in the prostatic secretion, the responsible organism is often difficult to find. Other organisms such as Chlamydia species may be responsible for chronic abacterial prostatitis. Clinical features The clinical features are extremely varied. Only men with symptoms of posterior urethritis, prostatic pain and perigenital pain accompanied by intermittent fever and pus cells or bacteria in the post-prostatic massage specimen should be diagnosed as having chronic prostatitis. Diagnosis The three-glass urine test is valuable. If the first glass with the initial voided sample shows urine containing prostatic threads, prostatitis is present. Rectal examination of the prostate may be normal or may show a soft, boggy and tender prostate. Examination of the prostatic fluid obtained by prostatic massage should show pus cells and bacteria. Urethroscopy may reveal inflammation of the prostatic urethra, and pus may be seen exuding from the prostatic ducts. The verumontanum is likely to be enlarged and oedematous. In many men with the symptoms described above, all investigations are normal. Treatment Antibiotic therapy should be administered only in accordance with bacteriological sensitivity tests. Trimethoprim or ciprofloxacin penetrate well into the prostate. If Trichomonas or anaerobes are the responsible agent, a rapid response is obtained from administration of metronidazole (200mg t. d. s. for 7 days to both paners). If Chlamydia is suspected, doxycycline is the antibiotic treatment of choice. There is little evidence that prostatic massage helps in eradicating the infection.

        "exp": "Posterior urethral valves Posterior urethral valves occur in around 1 in 5000-8000 live male bihs. The valves are membranes that have a small posterior slit within them, which typically lie just distal to the verumontanum and cause obstruction to the urethra of boys. They function as flap valves and so although they are obstructive to antegrade urinary flow, a urethral catheter can be passed retrogradely without any difficulty. Clinical features Newborns may present with palpable abdominal masses (distended bladder, hydronephrotic kidney & Ascites) Infants with Urinary infection & sepsis. Sometimes, the valves are incomplete and the patient remains without symptoms untill adolescence or adulthood Approximately 30% of patients experience end stage renal disease Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in 50% of patients DIAGNOSIS Posterior urethral valves need to be detected and treated as early as possible to minimise the degree of renal failure. The presentation varies according to the severity of the obstruction. The more severe the obstruction, the earlier the presen tation. Diagnosis is most commonly made antenatally with ultrasound, which demonstrates bilateral hydronephrosis above a distended bladder. If the diagnosis is not made antenatally, then babies typically present with urinary infection in the neonatal period or with uraemia and renal failure. Rarely the valves are incomplete and the patient is symp tom free until adolescence or adulthood, when again urinary infection or renal impairment can supervene. Investigation will involve a voiding cystogram, with the dilatation of the urethra above the valves demonstrable on a voiding cystogram. The bladder is hypero phied and often shows diveicula. Typically, there is vesico- ureteric reflux into dilated upper tracts. The valves themselves can be difficult to see on urethroscopy because the flow ofirrigant sweeps them into the open position. Renal function is usually impaired, albeit to a varying degree, and the extent is fuher assessed by measurement of ultrasound scanning, which will assess the renal coical thickness, and renography to assess differential renal function. TREATMENT Initial treatment is by catheterisation to relieve the obstruction and to allow the effects of renal failure to improve. Definitive treatment is by endoscopic destruction of the valves with continuing lifelong suppoive treatment of the dilated urinary tract, the recurrent urinary infections and the uraemia.

EPIDEMIOLOGY The strongest predisposing factor to BCC is UVR. It occurs in the elderly or the middle-aged after excessive sun exposure, with 95% occurring between the ages of 40 and 80 years. The incidence of BCC rises with proximity to the equator, although 33% arise in pas of the body not usually sunexposed. Other predisposing factors include exposure to arsenical compounds, coal tar, aromatic hydrocarbons, ionising radiation and genetic skin cancer syndromes. White- skinned people are almost exclusively affected. BCC is more common in men than women. PATHOGENESIS BCCs have no apparent precursor lesions and their development is propoional to the initial dose of the carcinogen, but not duration of exposure. The most likely model of pathogenesis for BCCs involves mesodermal factors as intrinsic promoters coupled with an initiation step. BCCs metastasise extremely rarely. MACROSCOPIC BCC can be divided into localised (nodular; nodulocystic; cystic; pigmented and naevoid) and generalised (superficial: multifocal and superficial spreading; or infiltrative: morphoeic, ice pick and cicatrizing). Nodular and nodulocystic variants account for 90% of BCC. MICROSCOPIC Twenty-six histological subtypes have been described. The characteristic finding is of ovoid cells in nests with a single 'palisading' layer. It is only the outer layer of cells that actively divide, explaining why tumour growth rates are slower thantheir cell cycle speed would suggest, and why incompletely excised lesions are more aggressive.

        "exp": "Rupture of the bulbar urethra There is a history of a blow to the perineum, usually due to a fall astride injury. The bulbar urethra is crushed upwards onto the pubic bone, typically with significant bruising. Extravasation of urine is common if the urine is not diveed and the extravasated urine is confined in front of the mid-perineal point by the attachment of Colles' fascia to the triangular ligament and by the attachment of Scarpa's fascia just below the inguinal ligament. The external spermatic fascia stops it getting into the inguinal canals. Extravasated urine collects in the scrotum and penis and beneath the deep layer of superficial fascia in the abdominal wall. CLINICAL FEATURES The signs of a ruptured bulbar urethra are perineal bruising and haematoma, typically with a butterfly distribution. There is usually bleeding from the urethral meatus and retention of urine is also typically present. MANAGEMENT If the diagnosis is suspected, the patient should be treated with appropriate analgesia and antibiotics should be administered. He should be discouraged from passing urine. A full bladder should be drained with a catheter placed by percutaneous suprapubic puncture using a Seldinger technique. This reduces urinary extravasation and allows investigations to establish the extent of the urethral injury. Diagnosis is made by urethrography using water-soluble contrast. If there is significant extravasation, then the perineal collection should be drained. The suprapubic catheter should remain in situ while the bruising and extravasation settle down and a stricture will typically develop at the site of the injury. The optimal treatment is delayed anastomotic urethroplasty after the swelling and bruising have settled down (typically 8-12 weeks later), with excision of the traumatised section and spatulated end-to-end reanastomosis of the urethra.

The stricture is cut under visual control using a knife passed through the sheath of a rigid urethroscope. The stricture is usually cut at the 12 o'clock position, taking care not to cut too deeply into the vascular spaces of the corpus spongiosum that surrounds the urethra. It is possible to get lost when trying to cut a way through a very tight stricture, and this is especially true when there are false passages because of previous dilatation attempts. Accordingly, a guidewire should be passed through to the bladder prior to incision of the stricture in order to establish the true lumen of the urethra. Following urethrotomy a catheter should be left in situ for 1-3 days afterwards. A single urethrotomy seems to give a permanent cure of an uncomplicated stricture in about 50% of patients. Success rates are highest when the stricture is sho and when it is present within the bulbar urethra.
