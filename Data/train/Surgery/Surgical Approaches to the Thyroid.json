It occurs if a thyrotoxic patient has been inadequately prepared for thyroidectomy.\"Thyrotoxic crisis (storm): This is an acute exacerbation of hyperthyroidism. It occurs if a thyrotoxic patient has been inadequately prepared for thyroidectomy and is now extremely rare. Very rarely, a thyrotoxic patient presents in a crisis and this may follow an unrelated operation. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is for dehydration, hyperpyrexia and restlessness. This requires the administration of intravenous fluids, cooling the patient with ice packs, administration of oxygen, diuretics for cardiac failure, digoxin for uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, sedation and intravenous hydrocortisone. Specific treatment is by carbimazole 10-20 mg 6-hourly, LugoVs iodine 10 drops 8-hourly by mouth or sodium iodide Ig i.v.

Most cases are caused by laryngeal oedema. The most important cause of laryngeal oedema is a tension haematoma.TransientHypocalcemiaCommonly occurs 24 to 48 hours after thyroidectomy but infrequently requires treatment.Markedly symptomatic or serum calcium < 7 mg/dL are given 1-2 ampules (10 to 20 mL) of 10% calcium gluconate IV over 1 to 2 min, followed by temporary' oral calcium carbonate (500 mg orally TDS).More prolonged IV replacement by mixing 6 ampules of 10% calcium gluconate in dextrose 5% in water (D5W), 500 mL, for infusion at 1 mL/kg'hour.PermanentHypocalcemiaPermanent hypoparathyroidism is uncommon after total thyroidectomy. Incidence of permanent hypoparathyroidism is < 1%. Present dramatically 2-5 days after operation. Normal parathyroid tissue removed or devascularized at the time of total thyroidectomy must be minced into 1 x 3-mm fragments and autotransplanted into individual muscle pockets in the sternocleidomastoid muscle to maximize the chances that the patient will not develop postoperative hypoparathyroidismRLN injuryUnilateral RLN injury causes hoarseness, and bilateral injury compromises the airway, necessitating tracheostomy. Unilateral or bilateral recurrent nerve paralysis will not cause immediate postoperative respiratory obstruction unless laryngeal oedema is also present but it wall aggravate the obstruction. RLN palsy rate of 1.8% at 1 month declining to 0.5% at 3 months for first-time operations. RLN can be repaired primarily or with a nerve graftSuperior laryngeal nerve injuryVoice changes, huskiness, poor volume voice fatigue, and inability to sing at higher rangesThyroidinsufficiencyTnis results from a change in the autoimmune response, from stimulation to destruction of the thyroid cells.Thyrotoxic crisis (storm)It occurs if a thyrotoxic patient has been inadequately prepared for thyroidectomy and is now extremely rare. Symptomatic & supportive treatment is for dehydration, hyperpyrexia & restlessness.Specific treatment is with carbimazole 10-20 mg 6-hourly, Lugol's iodine 10 drops 8-hourly by mouth or sodium iodide 1 g IV. Propranolol TV (1-2 mg) or orally (40 mg 6-hourly) will block P-adrenergic effects.WoundinfectionCellulitis requiring prescription of antibiotics, often by the general practitioner, is more common than most surgeons appreciate. A significant subcutaneous or deep cervical abscess is exceptionally rare and should be drainedHypertrophicor keloid scarThis is more likely to form if the incision overlies the sternum and in dark-skinned individuals. Intradermal injections of corticosteroid should be given at once and repeated monthly if necessary.StitchgranulomaThis may occur with or without sinus formation and is seen after the use of nonabsorbable, particularly silk, suture material. Absorbable ligatures and sutures must be used throughout thyroid surgery. Skin staples , if used, can be removed safely in less than 48 hours because the skin closure is supported by the platysma stitch.",
