Most probable diagnosis in a child with raised ICT, lesion around foramen of Monroe and multiple periventricular calcific foci on CT scan is subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. \"Foramen of Monro (FM) is a Y-shaped structure that connects the two lateral ventricles with the third ventricle. FM masses are uncommon in young children. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SGCA) occurs in older children and young adults with tuberous sclerosis. Pilocytic astrocytoma also occurs in this age group. Subependymoma and central neurocytoma occurs in adults. All FM masses can cause obstructive hydrocephalous and lead to raised intracranial tension. \"Well Delinated Intraventricular-Mass around Foramen of Monro with Calcification and Obstructive Hydrocephalus.

Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SGCA)SGCA is a low grade (WHO grade I) tumor that occurs almost exclusively in patients with tuberous sclerosisQ; 10- 15% patients of TS develop SGCA. Arise from subependymal nodules located on the lateral walls of lateral ventricles overlying the head of caudate nucleus. The tumor does not invade the underlying caudate head but rather grows exophytically into the ventricular lumen near the foramen of Monro. QSGCA is sharply delineated lobulated heterogenous tumor. Intratumor heavy calcification is commonQ and tumors are often vascular. SGCA almost always occur at foramen of MonroQ, and most patients become symptomatic before age 20 due to obstruction of foramen of MonroQ leading to raised ICT or obstructive hydrocephalus. Diagnosis: Imaging features of SGCA include: heterogenous (partially cystic, partially heavily calcified) mass at foramen of Monro which shows strong but heterogenous contrast enhancement.",

In an acute setting, when patient presents with Coma the investigation of choice is CT scan. In an elective situation, the best investigation would be 18 FDG-PET. Imaging in Brain Tumours. CT Scan. It is the investigation of choice in emergency situation when patient comes with decreased GCS. Headache, nausea, vomiting and progressive mental status decline are indicative of increased intra cranial pressure. CT scan is used to rule out increased intra cranial pressure and midline shift due to recurrent tumor. Decision to take the patient for surgery depends on CT findings. MRI Brain. It is used in elective situation for diagnosis of brain tumors. MRI is very helpful in identifying tumors in the posterior fossa (including acoustic neuromas), hemorrhagic lesions. MRI is also investigation of choice for diagnosing Brain Metastasis. PET-Imaging. Metabolic imaging tool that is able to distinguish between benign and malignant tumours. 18 FDG-PET and HMPAO-SPECT are used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and fibrosis at the site of operation. This has to be done in an elective situation. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a nuclear medicine tomographic imaging technique using gamma rays. The gamma-emitting tracer used in functional brain imaging is99m. Tc-HMPAO (hexamethylpropylene amine oxime). Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is used in PET scan. FDG uptake is increased in most malignant tissues. The sensitivity of 18 FDG-PET is better than MRI and CT in diagnosing residual and recurrent brain tumours.",
