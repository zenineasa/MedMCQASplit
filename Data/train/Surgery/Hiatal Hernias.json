        "exp": "Ans. is 'a'i. e., Esophagitis due to continuous reflux o There are 4 types of hiatal hernia. Type I: Sliding hernia (most common type ~ 70 - 80%). Type II: Paraesophageal or rolling hernia Type. III: Mixed. Type IV: These hernias are distinguished by the presence of other abdominal viscera wihin the defect i. e. omentum, transverse colon. o Type I or Sliding hiatal hernia# This is characterized by upward dislocation of the cardioesophageal junction into the posterior mediastinum. o Type II or Rolling Paraesophageal hernia# The cardioesophageal junction is undisplaced# The whole or part of stomach herniates into the thorax immediately adjacent and to the left of the undisplaced cardioesophageal junction.# Since the normally located gastroesophageal junction functions normally in most of these hernias, reflux is uncommon.

This is an answer of exclusion: In carcinoma esophagus and achlasia the prominent symptom is dysphagia and not regurgitation of food. Tracheoesophageal fistula is unlikely in this age group.
