Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 1375)CARCINOMA OF PENISAetiology# Circumcision6 soon after birth confers almost complete immunity against carcinoma of the penis.# Later circumcision does not seem to have the same effect and muslims circumcised between the ages of 4 and 9 years are still liable to the disease.# Chronic balanoposthitis in known to be a contributory factor. 6# Definite precarcinomatous states:- Leucoplakia of the glans is similar to the condition seen on the tongue;- Longstanding genital warts may rarely be the site of malignant change;- Paget's disease of the penis. Pathology# Carcinoma of the penis may be flat and infiltrating or papillary.# The former often starts as leucoplakia and the latter results from an existing papilloma.# The earliest lymphatic spread is to the inguinal and then to the iliac nodes. 6# Once the growth breaches the partial barrier formed by the fascial sheath of the corpora cavernosa it spreads rapidly and iliac lymph node involvement is common. 6# Distant metastatic deposits are infrequent. Clinical Features# Forty % of patients are under 40 years of age.# There is little or no pain.# Sixty % have inguinal lymph node enlargement when they present but in half this is reactive enlargement due to sepsis.# Later the inguinal nodes erode the skin of the groin and the death of the patient may be due to involvement of the femoral or external iliac artery with TORRENTIAL HEMORRHAGE. 6. Rx# Radiotherapy is effective (60-70 % survival at 5years) if the growth is small.# Surgery is needed for large anaplastic growths, if there is infiltration of the shaft and when radiotherapy fails. 0# Partial amputation is used for distal growths when adequate clearance of the tumor is possible.# When an advanced, infiltrating or anaplastic lesion is present, total amputation is necessary.# Treatment of associated enlarged inguinal lymph nodes should usually be delayed until at least 3 weeks after local treatment to the primary lesion.# If surgery to the nodes is impossible, radiotherapy may cause a worthwhile temporary regression. Also know: Buschke-Lowenstein tumor is uncommon, verrucous carcinoma. It is locally destructive and invasive, but appears not to spread to lymph nodes or to metastasise. Treatment is by surgical excision. Paget's disease of the penis (syn. erythroplasia of Queyrat)0 is 'a persistent rawness of the glans like a long-standing balanitis followed by cancer of the substance of the penis' (Sir James Pager).

Prolonged priapism is associated with erectile dysfunction, especially if surgical decompression by shunt formation is performed.- If aspiration of the sludged blood in the corpora cavernosa fails to cause detumescence, and injection of metaraminol or 1: 100 000 adrenaline solution is ineffective, it may be necessary to decompress the penis by an anastomosis between the corpus spongiosum and one of the corpora cavernosa.

The external meatus opens on the underside of the penis or the perineum, and the ventral aspect of the prepuce is poorly developed ( hooded prepuce'). Hypospadias is classified according to the position of the meatus:# * Glanular or distal hvpospadia: most common form and does not usually require treatment. Opening is found near the head of the penis. The normal site of the external meatus is marked by a blind pit, although it occasionally connects by a channel to the ectopic opening on the underside of the glans.# * Coronal hypospadias. The meatus is placed at the junction of the underside of the glans and the body of the penis.# * Penile and penoscrotal hypospadias. The opening is on the underside of the penile shaft (.# * Perineal hvpospadias. This is the most severe abnormality. The scrotum is bifid and the urethra opens between its two halves. There may be testicular maldescent, which may make it difficult to determine the sex of the child. The more severe varieties of hypospadias represent an absence of the urethra and corpus spongiosum distal to the ectopic opening. The absent structures are represented by a fibrous cord, which deforms the penis in a downward direction (chordee). Rx: Glanular hypospadias does not need treatment unless the meatus is stenosed, in which case a meatotomy is performed. Surgery is indicated for other forms of hypospadias to improve sexual function, to correct problems with the urinary stream and for cosmetic reasons. A variety of plastic surgical procedures is described to correct the chordee and to re-site the urethral opening. Most procedures use preputial skin and so circumcision should be avoided until the hypospadias has been repaired.",

Epispadias - Treatment consist of correction of penile curvature reconstriction of the bladder neck in incontinent patients. Congenital urethral stricture - commonly these strictures are thin diaphragms that may respond to simple dilation onto direct vision internal urethrotomy. A single treatment by optical urethrotomy or dilatation is usually effective (1388-Bailey & Love 24th)* A one stage dorsal free graft urethroplasty for bulbar urethral structure to reduce the incidence of urethrocele.",
