If the perforation is difficult to close primarily itis frequently possible to seal the leak with an omental patch (Graham patch) alone, and many surgeons now employ this strategy for all perforations. In the past, many surgeons performed definitive procedures such as either truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty or, more recently and probably more successfully, highly selective vagotomy during the course of an operation for a perforation.

A severe attack may be heralded by an initial clinical impression of a very ill patient and a worsening physiological state at 24-48 hours. Various prognostic scoring systems have been used, all aimed at predicting persistent organ failure, paicularly respiratory, cardiac and renal. Severity stratification assessments should be performed in patients at 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days after admission. The Ranson and Glasgow scoring systems are specific for acute pancreatitis, and a score of 3 or more at 48 hours indicates a severe attack. Several other systems that are used in intensive care units can also be applied. These include the APACHE, SAPS, SOFA, MODS and modified Marshall scoring systems (the latter has the advantage of simplicity). Regardless of the system used, persisting organ failure indicates a severe attack. A serum C-reactive protein level >150 mg/L at 48 hours after the onset of symptoms is also an indicator of severity. Patients with a body mass index over 30 are at higher risk of developing complications. A revision in 2013 of the Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis (1992) recommends that patients with acute pancreatitis be stratified into 3 groups: Mild acute pancreatitis: * no organ failure; * no local or systemic complications. Moderately severe acute pancreatitis: * organ failure that resolves within 48 hours (transient organ failure); and/or * local or systemic complications without persistent organ failure.

        "exp": "Right hemicolectomy Carcinoma of the caecum or ascending colon is treated by right hemicolectomy. At open surgery the peritoneum lateral to the ascending colon is incised, and the incision is carried around the hepatic flexure. The right colon and mesentery are elevated, taking care not to injure the ureter, gonadal vessels or the duodenum. The ileocolic aery is ligated close to its origin from the superior mesenteric aery ('high-tie') and divided. Where the right colic aery has a separate origin from the superior mesenteric aery (around 10% of patients) this is separately ligated. The mesentery of the distal 20 cm of ileum and the mesocolon as far as the proximal third of the transverse colon is divided. The greater omentum is divided up to the point of intended division of the transverse colon. When it is clear that there is an adequate blood supply at the resection margins, the right colon is resected, and an anastomosis is fashioned between the ileum and the transverse colon. If the tumour is at the hepatic flexure the resection must be extended fuher along the transverse colon and will involve dividing the right branch of the middle colic aery. Extended right hemicolectomy Carcinomas of the transverse colon and splenic flexure are most commonly treated by an extended right hemicolectomy. The extent of the resection is from the right colon to the descending colon. The mobilisation is as for a right hemicolectomy but dissection continues to take down the splenic flexure and the whole transverse mesocolon is ligated. Some surgeons prefer to perform a left hemicolectomy for a splenic flexure cancer. Left hemicolectomy This is the operation of choice for descending colon and sigmoid cancers. The left half of the colon is mobilised completely along the 'white line' that marks the lateral attachment of the mesocolon. As the sigmoid mesentery is mobilised, the left ureter and gonadal vessels must be identified and protected. The splenic flexure may be mobilised by extending the lateral dissection from below and completed by entering the lesser sac. The inferior mesenteric aery below its left colic branch, together with the related paracolic lymph nodes, is included in the resection by ligating the inferior mesenteric aery close to its origin ('high-tie'). For full mobility the inferior mesenteric vein is also ligated and divided at the lower border of the pancreas. The bowel and mesentery can then be resected to allow a tension-free anastomosis. A temporary diveing stoma may be fashioned upstream, usually by formation of a loop ileostomy. This is usually undeaken if the anastomosis is below the peritoneal reflection of the rectum, because healing is more likely to be impaired distally. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 1264",

Clinical features Although simple epithelial splits, acute anal fissures are, because of their location involving the exquisitely sensitive anoderm, characterised by severe anal pain associated with defaecation, which usually resolves spontaneously after a variable time only to recur at the next evacuation, as well as the passage of fresh blood, normally noticed on the tissue after wiping. Chronic fissures are characterised by a hyperophied anal papilla internally and a sentinel tag externally (both consequent upon attempts at healing and breakdown), between which lies the slightly indurated anal ulcer overlying the fibres of the internal sphincter. When chronic, patients may also complain of itching secondary to irritation from the sentinel tag, discharge from the ulcer or discharge from an associated intersphincteric fistula, which has arisen through infection penetrating the fissure base. Although most sufferers are young adults, the condition can affect any age, from infants to the elderly. Men and women are affected equally. Anterior fissures account for about 10% of those encountered in women (and many of these may occur postpaum) but only 1% in men. A fissure sited elsewhere around the anal circumference or with atypical features should raise the suspicion of a specific aetiology, and the inability to be able to conduct an adequate examination in the clinic should prompt early examination under anaesthesia, with biopsy and culture to exclude Crohn's disease, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related ulcers (syphilis, Chlamydia, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, HSV, cytomegalovirus, Kaposi's sarcoma, B-cell lymphoma) and squamous cell carcinoma.

Incidence Insulinomas are the most frequent of all the functioning PETs with a repoed incidence of 2-4 cases per million population per year. Insulinomas have been diagnosed in all age groups, with the highest incidence found in the fouh to the sixth decades. Women seem to be slightly more frequently affected. Pathology The aetiology and pathogenesis of insulinomas are unknown. No risk factors have been associated with these tumours. Viually all insulinomas are located in the pancreas and tumours are equally distributed within the gland. Approximately 90% are solitary and about 10% are multiple and associated with MEN 1 syndrome. Prognosis and predictive factors No markers are available that reliably predict the biological behaviour of an insulinoma. Approximately 10% are malignant. Insulinomas of <2 cm in diameter without signs of vascular invasion or metastases are considered benign. Clinical features Insulinomas are characterised by fasting hypoglycaemia and neuroglycopenic symptoms. The episodic nature of the hypoglycaemic attacks is caused by intermittent insulin secretion by the tumour. This leads to central nervous system symptoms such as diplopia, blurred vision, confusion, abnormal behaviour and amnesia. Some patients develop loss of consciousness and coma. The release of catecholamines produces symptoms such as sweating, weakness, hunger, tremor, nausea, anxiety and palpitations. Biochemical diagnosis A fasting test that may last for up to 72 hours is regarded as the most sensitive test. Usually, insulin, proinsulin, C- peptide and blood glucose are measured in 1- to 2-hour intervals to demonstrate inappropriately high secretion of insulin in relation to blood glucose. About 80% of insulinomas are diagnosed by this test, most of them in the first 24 hours. Elevated C-peptide levels demonstrate the endogenous secretion of insulin and exclude factitious hypoglycaemia caused by insulin injection. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 849",

Pneumoperitoneum is created up to a pressure of 15 mm. Hg which distends the abdominal cavity adequately to have proper visualisation of the abdominal contents. Laparoscope is inseed through the umbilical po (10 mm). Abdomen is evaluated for any pathology. Liver, gallbladder, pelvic organs are visualised. Additional pos (3-4) through trocars are placed depending on the procedure to be done. It may be eitherm5 mm po or 10 mm po. These pos are placed in such a way to have a proper triangulation of instruments for dissection. To use clip applicator 10 mm po is required.

        "exp": "Aetiology of Acute pancreatitis The two major causes of acute pancreatitis are biliary calculi, which occur in 50-70% of patients, and alcohol abuse, whichaccounts for 25% of cases. Gallstone pancreatitis is thought to be triggered by the passage of gallstones down the common bile duct. If the biliary and pancreatic ducts join to share a common channel before ending at the ampulla, then obstruction of this passage may lead to reflux of bile or activated pancreatic enzymes into the pancreatic duct. Patients who have small gallstones and a wide cystic duct may be at a higher risk of passing stones. The proposed mechanisms for alcoholic pancreatitis include the effects of diet, malnutrition, direct toxicity of alcohol, concomitant tobacco smoking, hypersecretion, duct obstruction or reflux, and hyperlipidaemia. The remaining cases may be due to rare causes or be idiopathic. Among patients who undergo ERCP, 1-3% develop pancreatitis, probably as a consequence of duct disruption and enzyme extravasation. Patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction or a history of recurrent pancreatitis, and those who undergo sphincterotomy or balloon dilatation of the sphincter, carry a higher risk of developing post-ERCP pancreatitis. Patients who have undergone upper abdominal or cardiothoracic surgery may develop acute pancreatitis in the postoperative phase, as may those who have suffered blunt abdominal trauma. Hereditary pancreatitis is a rare familial condition associated with mutations of the cationic trypsinogen gene. Patients have a tendency to suffer acute pancreatitis while in their teens, progress to chronic pancreatitis in the next two decades and have a high risk (possibly up to 40%) of developing pancreatic cancer by the age of 70 years. Occasionally, tumours at the ampulla of Vater may cause acute pancreatitis. It is impoant to check the serum calcium level, a fasting lipid profile, autoimmune markers and viral titres in patients with so called idiopathic acute pancreatitis. It is equally impoant to take a detailed drug history and remember the association of coicosteroids, azathioprine, asparaginase and valproic acid with acute pancreatitis. Statins (taken over a long time) and gliptins have been linked with pancreatitis, but the evidence is slim. It is essential to exclude tiny gallstones. A careful search for the aetiology must be made in all cases, and no more than 20% of cases should fall into the idiopathic category. Possible causes of acute pancreatitis * Gallstones * Alcoholism * Post ERCP * Abdominal trauma * Following biliary, upper gastrointestinal or cardiothoracic surgery * Ampullary tumour * Drugs (coicosteroids, azathioprine, asparaginase, valproic acid, thiazides, oestrogens) * Hyperparathyroidism * Hypercalcaemia * Pancreas divisum * Autoimmune pancreatitis * Hereditary pancreatitis * Viral infections (mumps, coxsackie B) * Malnutrition * Scorpion bite * Idiopathic Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 1222",

Common in females between 20 and 40 years age group. * Chest pain occurs in an early stage. * Achalasia with diffuse oesophageal spasm is called as 'vigorous achalasia'. * Presents with progressive dysphagia, which is more for liquid than to solid food. * Regurgitation and recurrent pneumonia are common (10%). * Malnutrition and general ill health. * Lung abscess formation. * Odynophagia and weight loss. Barium swallow is diagnostic (bird beak appearance ) Ref: SRB&; s manual of surgery, 3 rd ed, pg no 745",

A severe attack may be heralded by an initial clinical impression of a very ill patient and a worsening physiological state at 24-48 hours. Various prognostic scoring systems have been used, all aimed at predicting persistent organ failure, paicularly respiratory, cardiac and renal. Severity stratification assessments should be performed in patients at 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days after admission. The Ranson and Glasgow scoring systems are specific for acute pancreatitis, and a score of 3 or more at 48 hours indicates a severe attack. Several other systems that are used in intensive care units can also be applied. These include the APACHE, SAPS, SOFA, MODS and modified Marshall scoring systems (the latter has the advantage of simplicity). Regardless of the system used, persisting organ failure indicates a severe attack. A serum C-reactive protein level >150 mg/L at 48 hours after the onset of symptoms is also an indicator of severity. Patients with a body mass index over 30 are at higher risk of developing complications. A revision in 2013 of the Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis (1992) recommends that patients with acute pancreatitis be stratified into 3 groups: Mild acute pancreatitis: * no organ failure; * no local or systemic complications. Moderately severe acute pancreatitis: * organ failure that resolves within 48 hours (transient organ failure); and/or * local or systemic complications without persistent organ failure. Severe acute pancreatitis: * persistent organ failure (>48 hours); * single organ failure; * multiple organ failure. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 1224",
