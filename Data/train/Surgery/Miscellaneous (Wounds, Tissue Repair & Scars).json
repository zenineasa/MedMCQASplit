The early stage of infection is characterised by a painless nodule, with non- pyogenic, necrotizing lesions developing in the skin, and occasionally in adjacent bone, as the disease progresses.* M. ulcerans secretes a lipid toxin, mycolactone, which functions as an immune suppressant, necrotising agent and activator of cellular apoptosis in mammalian tissues.* The disease is primarily an infection of subcutaneous fat, resulting in a focus of necrotic (dead) fat containing myriads of the mycobacteria in characteristic spherules formed within the dead fat cells. Skin ulceration is a secondary event.* All other ulcers are associated with significant scarring in the tissues. Scarring in gastric ulcer/duodenal ulcer leads to gastric outlet obstruction.",
