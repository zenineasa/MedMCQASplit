An alternative method of preparation is to abolish the clinical manifestations of the toxic state, using b-adrenergic blocking drugs. These act on the target organs and not on the gland itself. Propranolol also inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. The appropriate dosages are propranolol 40 mg t. d. s. or the longer acting nadolol 160 mg once daily. b-adrenergic blocking drugs do not interfere with the synthesis of thyroid hormones, and hormone levels remain high during treatment and for some days after thyroidectomy. It is, therefore, impoant to continue treatment for 7 days postoperatively. Iodine may be given with carbimazole or a b-adrenergic blocking drug for 10 days before operation.

There are subtypes of lobular cancer, including the classical type, that carry a better prognosis than the pleomorphic type. Occasionally, the picture may be mixed with both ductal and lobular features. There are different patterns of spread depending on histological type. If there is doubt whether a tumour is predominantly lobular in type, immunohistochemical analysis using the e-cadherin antibody, which reacts positively in lobular cancer, will help in diagnosis. Rarer histological variants, usually carrying a better prognosis, include colloid or mucinous carcinoma, whose cells produce abundant mucin, medullary carcinoma, with solid sheets of large cells often associated with a marked lymphocytic reaction and tubular carcinoma. Invasive lobular carcinoma is commonly multifocal and/or bilateral, hence the increasing use of MRI for assessment. Cases detected the screening programme are often smaller and better differentiated than those presenting to the symptomatic service and are of a special type.
