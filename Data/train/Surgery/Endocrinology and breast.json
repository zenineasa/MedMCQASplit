There are subtypes of lobular cancer, including the classical type, that carry a better prognosis than the pleomorphic type. Occasionally, the picture may be mixed with both ductal and lobular features. There are different patterns of spread depending on histological type. If there is doubt whether a tumour is predominantly lobular in type, immunohistochemical analysis using the e-cadherin antibody, which reacts positively in lobular cancer, will help in diagnosis. Rarer histological variants, usually carrying a better prognosis, include colloid or mucinous carcinoma, whose cells produce abundant mucin, medullary carcinoma, with solid sheets of large cells often associated with a marked lymphocytic reaction and tubular carcinoma. Invasive lobular carcinoma is commonly multifocal and/or bilateral, hence the increasing use of MRI for assessment. Cases detected the screening programme are often smaller and better differentiated than those presenting to the symptomatic service and are of a special type.
