        "question": "Which among the following surgery requires lithotomy position",
        "exp": "Ans) a (Anal) Ref: http://en. wikipedia. org. The lithotomy position refers to a common position for surgical procedures and medical examinations involving the pelvis and lower abdomen. References to the position have been found in some of the oldest known medical documents including versions of the Hippocratic oath. The position is named after the ancient surgical procedure for removing kidney stones, gall stones and bladder stones via the perineum. The position is perhaps most recognizable as the 'often used' position for childbirth: the patient is laid on the back with knees bent, positioned above the hips, and spread apart through the use of stirrups. Obvious benefits from the position is that it provides good visual and physical access to the perineal region. The position is used for procedures ranging from simple pelvic exams to surgeries and procedures involving, but not limited to reproductive organs, urology, and gastrointestinal systems. Used for perianal surgeries like haemorrhoidectomy, fistulectomy, lateral sphinc-terotomy; perineal surgeries like APR & vaginal hysterectomy.",

QExcision is done. QRepeated thrombosis leads to semi-ripe black current appearance. Hemorrhoid. Recent theories regard hemorrhoids as normal anatomical structuresQ. These are cushions of submucosal tissue containing venules, arterioles, smooth muscle fibres and elastic connective tissue. Three hemorrhoidal cushions are found in the left lateral, right anterior and right posterior position (3, 7 and 11 O' Clock)QHemorrhoids or piles are symptomatic anal cushions. More common when intra-abdominal pressure is raised, e. g. in obesity, constipation and pregnancy. Symptoms: bright-red, painless bleeding, mucus discharge and prolapse. Hemorrhoids cannot be palpated, best diagnosed by proctoscopyQ. Internal Hemorrhoids.

Permanently prolapsed and cannot be manually reduced. QTreatment: Mere presence of hemorrhoids is not necessarily an indication of treatment. Treatment is only indicated if they are symptomatic. Best treatment is the least invasive one which is possible to alleviate the symptomsQ. Treatment of hemorrhoids. Medical therapy* Bleeding from 1st and 2nd degree hemorrhoids often improve with the addition of dietary fibre, stool softeners and other diet regulationQ. Rubber band ligation* Done for 1st, 2nd and selected 3rd degree hemorrhoids. QInfrared Photocoagulation* Done for 1st and 2nd degree hemorrhoids.
