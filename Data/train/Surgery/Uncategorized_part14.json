The area of cutaneous injury has been divided into three zones: zone of coagulation, zone of stasis, and zone of hyperemia Zone of coagulation: The volume injured most severely, in the center of the wound, is the zone of coagulation. This is the area of necrosis where the cells have been disrupted. The tissue is irreversibly damaged at the time of injury. Zone of stasis: Outside the zone of coagulation is the zone of stasis. The zone of stasis is ischemic but potentially salvageable. Depending on the wound environment, can either survive or progress to coagulative necrosis. The zone of stasis is associated with vascular damage and vessel leakage.. Zone of hyperaemia: Beyond the zone of stasis lies the zone of hyperaemia This area is characterized by minimal cell injury but with vasodilatation due to neighboring inflammation-induced mediators. This region contains clearly ble tissue from which the healing process begins and is generally not at risk for fuher necrosis. In practice, attentive wound care and careful fluid resuscitation may salvage the zone of stasis and prevent a superficial injury from becoming full thickness",

It consists of both epithelial and lymphoid elements thus known as adenolymphoma (probably arises from remnants of parotid tissue trapped in lymphnodes within the parotid gland). Also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum. The tumor arises only in the parotid gland. Almost always arises in the lower poion of the parotid gland overlying the angle of mandible. Common in males. (Occurs most often in older white men) Age: 54h to 7th decade. Association is seen with smoking. Bilaterality is seen in 10% cases. Its well encapsulated, extremely slow growing tumor, never turns malignant. A peculiar feature of Wahins tumor is that it shows 'hot' spot in 99'n Tc-peechnate scan. Other tumors of the parotid show 'cold' spot (Oncocytomas another benign parotid tumor also shows hot spot). (Because of the high mitochondrial content within oncocytes, the oncocyte-rich Wahin tumor and Oncocytomas incorporate technetium Tc 99m and appear as hot spots on radionuclide scans.) Also remember Godwin 's tumor - Benign lymphoepithelial tumor of the parotid gland. Most salivary gland tumors are benign. However remember that the smaller the salivary gland, the higher is the chance of the tumor being malignant.

        "question": "Dumping syndrome is characterized by all of the following except: March 2005",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Hyperglycemia Dumping syndrome is a relatively rare disorder in which the stomach contents are delivered too quickly to the small intestine. It occurs as a physiological reaction to the consumption of too much simple or refined sugar in some persons, when simple sugar exits the stomach too rapidly it attracts fluid into the upper intestine, and the blood volume decreases as it attempts to absorb the sugar. Dumping syndrome is one of the unwanted post operative sequelae to paial gastrectomy. This symptom complex is believed to be due to rapid emptying of the gastric contents into the upper small intestine and also an increased transit rate through the small bowel itself right through the colon. As a consequence of this dumping a large volume of hyperosmotic fluid enters the small intestine. In an attempt to bring the osmotic tension to the physiological range, large amount of fluid cross the intestinal mucosa. As a result the plasma volume is reduced, which in turn exes a vasomotor effect. The vasomotor symptoms comprise general weakness, pallor, sweating, palpitation and light headedness. Another set of symptoms of gastrointestinal disturbance such as epigastric discomfo, nausea, vomiting and possibly an episode of diarrhea is observed. The biochemical changes that occur in dumping syndrome are hyperinsulinaemia followed by hypoglycaemia due to rapid transpo and absorption of food from small intestine after a meal. Since the conversion of glucose to glycogen and its storage consumes potassium, its level in blood decreases in dumping syndrome and hence hypokalaemia may be seen too. These symptoms classically occur some 5-30 minutes after eating and are more marked if the meal is large paicularly if it contains a substantial amount of carbohydrate and liquid. The choices for managing dumping syndrome include dietary changes, medications and surgery. Although dumping syndrome classically develops after gall bladder surgery, it may also occur after other abdominal operations, such as duodenal ulcer surgery or surgery for severe reflux. Sometimes it may be seen in people born with unusually small stomach and very rarely in those with stomach abnormalities.",

The fracture extends from posterior iliac crest, passing through iliac wing (just behind gluteal pillar), and may then exit in greater sciatic notch or more commonly may enter the sacroiliac (S I) joint - which is then disrupted inferiorly pretending of as fracture dislocation of SI joint complex. The injury leaves a crescent shaped poion of iliac wing attached to the superior aspect of the sacrum, held in place by stout SI ligament. Lateral compression I are the most common pelvic ring disruption injuries. The fracture often passes through sacral foramina (outlet view) or causing buckling of anterior sacral coex only (best seen on CT or inlet view). These are veically stable and rotationally unstable (to some degree). Lateral compression III occurs when lateral (internally rotating) force compressing one side of ring continues and opens up (externally rotates) the hemipelvis of other side. An internal rotation vector causing sacral or iliac wing compression fracture on one side becomes an external rotation vector on opposite hemipelvis manifesting as paial or complete disruption of SI joint; thus leading to wind swept pelvis appearance.

B: Hyperkalemia Parenteral nutrition is indicated to prevent the adverse effects of malnutrition in patients who are unable to obtain adequate nutrients by oral or enteral routes. Other indications are sho gut syndrome, high-output fistula, prolonged ileus, or bowel obstruction. Sho-term TPN may be used if a person's digestive system has shut down (for instance by Peritonitis. Chronic TPN is performed through a central intravenous catheter, usually in the subclan or jugular vein. In infants, sometimes the umbilical vein is used. Complications: Catheter complications include pneumothorax, accidental aerial puncture, and catheter-related sepsis. The most common complication of TPN use is bacterial infection, usually due to the increased infection risk from having an indwelling central venous catheter. Liver failure / reversible cholestatic jaundice, often related to Fatty liver, may occur. Two related complications of TPN are venous thrombosis and rarely priapism. Fat infusion during TPN is assumed to contribute to both. Total parenteral nutrition increases the risk of acute cholecystitis due to complete unusage of gastrointestinal tract, which may result in bile stasis in the gallbladder. Metabolic complications include the Refeeding Syndrome characterised by hypophosphataemia and other electrolyte abnormalities. Nutrients deficiency: hypoglycemia/ hypocalcemia/ hypomagnesemia are also seen. Hyperglycemia is common at the sta of therapy, and hypoglycaemia is likely to occur with abrupt cessation of TPN. Hyperosmolar dehydration is also associated with excesss of glucose. Excess fat leads to hyperchlosterolemia and formation of lipoprotein X and hyperiglyceridemia.

Blood has also role in burn patient. The need for Blood replacement is significant in extensive burns. Besides injury to red blood cells and their decreased half-life resulting in their early destruction, many patients may be anaemic. Hence, repeated and frequent transmission to maintain a hematocrit around 35% is necessary. Schwartz 9/e p201 writes- \"The role of blood transfusion in burns has undergone a re-evaluation in recent years. A large multicenter study found that increased numbers of transfusions were associated with increased infections and a higher mortality rate in burn patients, even when correcting for burn severity. A follow-up study implanting a restrictive transfusion policy in burned children showed that a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL had no more adverse outcomes versus a traditional transfusion trigger of 10 g/dL. These data, in concert with other reported complications such as transfusion-related lung injury, have led to recommendations that blood transfusions be used only when there is an apparent physiologic need. \"",

Endemic Bladder Calculi \u2022 In children, stones are composed mainly of ammonium acid urate, calcium oxalate, or an impure mixture of ammonium acid urate and calcium oxalate with calcium phosphate. \u2022 The common link among endemic areas relates to feeding infants human breast milk and polished rice. \u2022 These foods are low in phosphorus, ultimately leading to high ammonia excretion. \u2022 These children also usually have a high intake of oxalate-rich vegetables (increased oxalate crystalluria) and animal protein (low dietary citrate). \u2022 Vesical calculi may be single or multiple, especially in the presence of bladder diverticula, and can be small or large enough to occupy the entire bladder. They range from soft to extremely hard, with surfaces ranging from smooth and faceted to jagged and spiculated (\"jack\" stones). \u2022 Most bladder stones are secondary, more common in older males (>50 years), usually because of bladder outlet obstruction. \u2022 MC type: Uric acid (sterile urine) > Struvite stones (Infected urine) \u2022 Bladder stones are usually solitary, multiple in 25% patients.

Infections of the cervix may present as a friable cervix, but are most often without signs or symptoms. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) caused by chlamydia often presents with milder symptoms than when it is caused by gonorrhea. Prompt treatment reduces the occurrence of long-term sequelae such as infeility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. The risk of infeility appears to be higher for chlamydial infections compared to any other STD. Screening women is impoant to reduce the risk of PID and its sequelae.",

The purpose of this procedure is to facilitate the flow of bile into the intestine. It is based on the observation that the fibrous tissue at the pa hepatitis invests microscopically patent biliary ductules that in turn communicates with the intrahepatic ductal system. Transecting this fibrous tissue, opens these channels and establishes bile flow into a surgically constructed intestinal conduit, using a Roux-en-Y limb of jejunum. Liver transplantation is done in those, who fail to respond to Pooenterostomy. About prognostic factors for successful outcome of the Kasai operation, we have consulted many books including books on Pediatric Surgery. The maximum information we could get was from CSDT, Maingot's and Schwaz. The prognostic factors are: a) Age of operation - a better prognosis is achieved with age less than 60 days (8 weeks given in 8th edition of Schwaz). b) Absence of cirrhosis - checked by bridging liver fibrosis on biopsy. c) Diameter of bile ductules at the poal plate - ductules greater than 150 gm in diameter are associated with good chances of bile drainage (- Maingot 10/e, p 2123) d) Establishment of adequate bile flow e) Cholangitic episodes - postoperative cholangitic episodes are associated with bad prognosis.",

Pehe's disease is an osteochondritis of the epiphysis of the femoral head (capital femoral epiphysis). In the disease, the femoral head becomes paly or wholly avascular and deformed. The disease occurs commonly in males in the age group of 5-10 years. Etiology of Pehe's disease Pehe's disease is the most common form of osteochondroses (osteochondroses are characterized by avascular necrosis (AVN) and defective endochondral ossification of primary or secondary ossification centers). The etiology remains unknown, but is currently accepted that the disorder is caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the capital femoral epiphysis, causing avascular necrosis. Clinical features of Pehes disease Pehes disease is common in male of age group 5-10 years. Pain in the hip, often radiating to knee. Limp (antalgic limp). Limitation of movement:- Abduction, internal rotation and extension are limited, therefore there is adduction, external rotation, and flexion deformity. Shoening of limb. Positive trendelenburg test. During the disease process, bone age is 1-3 years lower than the normal. After healing, bone age returns to normal. Radiological investigations for Pehe's disease Following radiological investigations are used: 1) X-ray hip Findings are:- Increased medial joint space Widening of femoral neck Lateral extrusion (lateral subluxation) Metaphyseal cysts and rarefaction of metaphysis Horizontal physis with speckled calcification lateral to it Fragmentation of femoral head with increased density (irregular densities in the epiphysis) 2) Bone scan May show a decrease uptake by femoral head. 3) MRI It is the investigation of choice as it can diagnose Pehes disease in early stages when X-ray is normal. MRI tells about:- Extent of area involved Sphericity of the head Subluxation of the head Thus MRI helps better in planning for management.",

        "exp": "Next Step: Diagnosis by demonstration of posterior urethral valves. Posterior urethral valves, the most common obstructive urethral lesions in infants and newborns, occur only in males and are found at the distal prostatic urethra. Demonstration of urethral valves on a voiding cystourethrogram establishes the diagnosis, as does endoscopic identification of valves. 2 possible answers for this question. a) Micturating Cystourethrogram b) Endoscopic identification of valve (in an emergency) In this question answer is Micturating Cystourethrogram. However, endoscopy is better because of severe obstruction indicated by b/l hydronephrosis and oligohydramnios. It can be clubbed with endoscopic destruction of the valve. Impoant: What does USG do? 1. Ultrasonography can be used to detect hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and bladder distension in children with severe azotemia. 2. It can also detect fetal hydronephrosis, which is typical of urethral valves, as early as 28 weeks of gestation - an enlarged bladder with bilateral hydroureteronephrosis is usually present in PUV. Treatment consists of destruction of the valves, but the approach depends on the degree of obstruction and the general health of the child. Treatment consists of destruction of the valves by endoscopic incision. In a premature infant with a small urethra prohibiting transurethral resection, a temporary cutaneous vesicostomy may be required to provide drainage and improve impaired kidney function.

The dermatophytoses are diseases caused by a group of closely related filamentous fungi with a propensity for invading the stratum corneum, hair, and nails. Dermatophyte infections are designated by the word tinea, followed by the Latin name of the site. Thus, tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection of the head. The three genera generally responsible for dermatophyte infections are Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. Both Microsporum and Trichophyton species commonly cause tinea capitis. The most common pathogens are Trichophyton tonsurans followed by Microsporum canis. These two pathogens are distinguished by the fact that hairs infected with Microsporum species fluoresce a bright blue green color whereas those infected by Trichophyton species usually do not fluoresce. In addition, T. tousurans often causes a unique pattern on the scalp known as \"black dot ringworm, \" characterized by circular patches of alopecia with hairs broken off close to the follicle. Epidermophyton species usually iuvade the iuteriginous skin, not the scalp. Epidermophyton floccosum is a cause of tinea crnsis, not tinea capitis.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e. History of previous radiation Conservative breast cancer management: Absolute Contraindications Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to the use of breast irradiation. However, in many cases, it may be possible to perform breast-conserving surgery in the third trimester and treat the patient with irradiation after delivery. Women with two or more primary tumors in separate quadrants of the breast or with diffuse malignant-appearing microcalcifications are not considered candidate for breast conservation treatment. A history of prior therapeutic irradiation to the breast region that would require retreatment to an excessively high total-radiation dose to a significant volume is another absolute contraindication. Persistent positive margins after reasonable surgical attempts. Relative Contraindications A history of collagen vascular disease is a relative contraindication to breast conservation treatment because published repos indicate that such patients tolerate irradiation poorly. Most radiation oncologists will not treat patients with scleroderma or active lupus erythematosus, considering it an absolute contraindication. In contrast, rheumatoid ahritisis not a relative or an absolute contraindication. The presence of multiple gross tumors in the same quadrant and indeterminate calcifications must be carefully assessed for suitability because studies in this area are not definitive. Tumor size is not an absolute contraindication to breast conservation treatment, although there is little published experience in treating patients with tumor sizes greater than four to five cm. However, a relative contraindication is the presence of a large tumor in a small breast in which an adequate resection would result in significant cosmetic alteration. In this circumstance, preoperative chemotherapy should be considered. Breast size can be a relative contraindication. Large pendulous breast is a relative contraindication, as it presents difficulty in delivering a uniform radiation dose. Centrally located tumor for which removal of the nipple areola complex is required to obtain a tumor free margin is a relative contraindication. It depends on patient acceptability. The nipple and areola can now be reconstructed.",

B: Lymph node involvement Prognostic factors include staging, (i. e., tumor size, location, grade, whether disease has traveled to other pas of the body), recurrence of the disease, and age of patient. The best indicators of likely prognosis in breast cancer remain tumour size and lymph node status, which are components of stage of a tumour. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the worse is the prognosis. The stage is raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive. For example, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) involving the entire breast will still be stage zero and consequently an excellent prognosis with a 10yr disease free survival.",

It is found most frequently in the mesentery of the ileum. The cyst wall is thin, made up of connective tissue; lacks the muscular wall of enteric duplication cyst. The cyst is not lined by mucosa. It is filled with clear lymph or chyle. A chylolymphatic cyst is almost invariably solitary, although in extremely rare cases, multiple cysts may be seen. The cyst is more often unilocular than multilocular. A chylolymphatic cyst has a blood supply independent of that of the adjacent intestine, and thus enucleation (resection) is possible without the need for resection of the gut. Enterogenous cyst Believed to be derived either from a diverticulum of the mesenteric border of the intestine which has become sequestered from the intestinal canal during embryonic life or from a duplication of the intestine. An enterogenous cyst has a thicker wall than a chylolymphatic cyst, and it is lined by mucous membrane, sometimes ciliated. The content is mucinous The enterogenosu cyst and the adjacent bowel wall has a common blood supply, therefore, enucleation of the cyst is always done along with resection of the related portion of intestine followed by anastomosis.

Only the absence of normal anatomical orientation differentiates this hetrotropic bone from normal. Otherwise it demonstrates all features of normal bone modeling (i. e., coical & trabecular organization, medullary canal, metaphyseal funneling) and remodeling (i. e., respond to weight bearing stress, resistance to fatigue fracture) - Bone morphogenetic protein - 4 (BMP - 4) is over expressed and Basic fibroblast growth factor which is an extremely potent stimulator of angiogenesis (in vivo) is elevated in urine during acute flare up stage. Clinical features - In myositis ossificans progressiva, the life expectancy is decreased and the commonest causes of death is lung diseaseQ. This autosomal dominant disease is characterized by hetrotropic ossification most commonly involving spine and congenital defomities of hand &feetQ. The disease usually stas before 6 year of ageQ - Moality in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive (myositis ossificans progressiva) is usually related to restrictive lung disease caused by an inability of chest to expandQ. - Begins in childhood usually before age of 6 yearsQ and becomes evident with in first 10 years of life. - Primary congenital skeletal abnormality is deformity of great toeQ. The toes may be sho, in valgus, monophalangic or have abnormal shaped proximal phalanx. - Begins as painful erythematous subfascial nodule mostly located on posterior aspect of neck & back which gradually calcify & eventually ossify (hetrotropic ossification) - The hetrotropic ossification progress in a axial to appendcular, cranial to caudal and proximal to distal direction. So the most commonly involved site is neck followed by spine & shoulder girdleQ. And same is the order for limitation of motion. - Trauma in form of tripping & falling, immunization, injection or biopsy stimulates new bouts of ossificationQ, and can be catastrophic. - The ossification is irreversible, unlike other forms of hetrotropic ossification.

Etiology The thyroid gland is inherently resistant to infection due to its extensive blood and lymphatic supply, high iodide content, and fibrous capsule. Infectious Agents can Seed Thyroid 1. Via hematogenous or lymphatic route 2. Via direct spread from persistent pyriform sinus fistulae or thyroglossal duct cysts 3. As a result of penetrating trauma 4. Due to immunosuppression \u2022 Streptococcus and anaerobes account for about 70% of cases. \u2022 In children and young adults, MC cause is presence of a pyriform sinus (remnant of the fourth branchial pouch that connects the oropharynx with thyroid), such sinuses are predominantly left-sided. \u2022 Long-standing goiter and degeneration in thyroid malignancy are risk factors in elderly.

Previous measurements of plasma creatinine concentration are paicularly helpful in this regard. Normal values from recent months or even years suggest that the current extent of renal dysfunction could be more acute, and hence reversible, than might otherwise be appreciated. In contrast, elevated plasma creatinine concentration in the past suggests that the renal disease represents the progression of a chronic process. Even if there is evidence of chronicity, there is the possibility of a superimposed acute process, such as ECFV depletion, supervening on the chronic condition. If the history suggests multiple systemic manifestations of recent onset (e. g., fever, polyahritis, and rash) it should be assumed that renal insufficiency is pa of the acute process.

Near total thyroidectomy with radioiodine & radiotherapy As already mentioned in previous question, Total or Near total thyroidectomy is t/t of choice in PTC and also FTC (except minimally invasive cancer). Radioactive iodine '3'1is used post-operatively to detect and destroy any metastatic disease. It is also advised by some expes to do a routine 1311scan and therapy for all patients of differentiated thyroid cancer, postoperatively (except those with occult or minimally invasive disease). Screening with RAI is more sensitive than chest x-ray or CT scanning for detecting metastases; however, it is less sensitive than Tg measurements for detecting metastatic disease in most differentiated thyroid cancers except Huhle cell tumors. External beam radiotherapy is used to treat bone metastasis (to prevent fracture or to control pain). It is also occasionally used to control unresectable, locally invasive or recurrent thyroid carcinoma. There is no role for routine chemotherapy in differentiated thyroid cancers. Other Postop management in differentiated thyroid cancers Thyroid Hormone T4 is given as replacement therapy in patients after total or near-total thyroidectomy, and has the additional effect of suppressing TSH and reducing the growth stimulus for any possible residual thyroid cancer cells. TSH suppression reduces tumor recurrence rates. Thyroglobulin measurement Thyroglobulin (Tg) is produced only by thyroid follicular cells. Following total thyroidectomy, it should be undetectable in serum and any detectable level then indicates the persistence or recurrence of neoplastic disease. This is the basis for the use of Tg as a post-operative tumor marker in the follow-up of thyroid cancer patients Tg levels in patients who have undergone total thyroidectomy should be <2 ng/mL when the patient is taking T4, and <5 ng/mL when the patient is hypothyroid.",

        "exp": "One of the main secretory products of carcinoid tumors involved in the carcinoid syndrome is serotonin, which is synthesized from tryptophan. Serotonin production is characteristic of gut carcinoid tumors. Serotonin is metabolized to 5-HIAA. Therefore, finding high levels of 5-HIAA in a 24-hour urine collection in a patient with flushing or other symptoms is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Serotonin has numerous biologic effects, including stimulating intestinal secretion with inhibition of absorption, stimulating increases in intestinal motility, and stimulating fibrogenesis. In various studies 56-88% of all carcinoid tumors were associated with serotonin overproduction; however, 12-26% of the patients did not have the carcinoid syndrome. In one study platelet serotonin was elevated in 96% of patients with midgut carcinoids, 43% with foregut tumors, and 0% with hindgut tumors. In 90-100% of patients with the carcinoid syndrome there is evidence of serotonin overproduction. Serotonin is thought to be predominantly responsible for the diarrhea because of its effects on gut motility and intestinal secretion, primarily through 5-HT3 and, to a lesser degree, 5-HT4 receptors.

The first full length medical study of the condition was John Eric Erichsen's classic book, On Railway and Other Injuries of the Nervous System. For this reason, railway spine is often known as \"Erichsen's disease\". Railway collisions were a frequent occurrence in the early 19th century. Exacerbating the problem was the fact that railway cars were flimsy, wooden structures with no protection for the occupants Soon a group of people staed coming forward who claimed that they had been injured in train crashes, but had no obvious evidence of injury. The railroads rejected these claims as fake. The nature of symptoms caused by \"railway spine\" was hotly debated in the late 19th century, notably at the meetings of the (Austrian) Imperial Society of Physicians in Vienna, 1886. Germany's leading neurologist, Hermann Oppenheim, claimed that all railway spine symptoms were due to physical damage to the spine or brain, whereas French and British scholars, notably Jean-Main Charcot and Herbe Page, insisted that some symptoms could be caused by hysteria (now known as conversion disorder). Erichsen observed that those most likely to be injured in a railway crash were those sitting with their backs to the acceleration. This is the same injury mechanism found in whiplash. As with automobile accidents, railway and airplane accidents are now known to cause posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychosomatic symptoms in addition to physical trauma.",

Common vesical stones are Uric acid stones & Struvite stones Other less common stone types are Oxalate stones Cystein stones Struvite stones are also known as 'Jack stones' because of their rough surface as against the smooth surface of uric acid stones.

Jractures_cotyle/index_us. shtml The posterior Kocher-Langenbeck approach is probably the best-known and the easiest incision for the management of acetabular fractures. Indications of the Kocher-Langenbeck Approach The following fractures are always accessed through a Kocher-Langenbeck approach: - Posterior wall fractures; - Posterior column fractures; - Posterior column plus posterior wall fractures; - Juxtatectal or infratectal transverse fractures. The following fractures may be accessed through a Kocher-Langenbeck approach: - Transverse fractures through the acetabular roof. However, a lateral approach will often be preferred. - T-shaped fractures, especially if the anterior column is not excessively displaced. Where difficulties are encountered, a large lateral approach is often preferred. - Low both-column fractures that do not involve the iliac wing. The following fractures are never accessed through a Kocher-Langenbeck approach: - Both-column fractures; - Anterior column fractures; - Anterior column plus posterior hemitransverse fractures.",

        "exp": "D i. e. Total knee replacement - Ahlbeck grade 2 osteoahritis (i. e. complete or almost complete obliterated joint space) with symptoms of pain and swelling in a sedentary patient (>65 years of age) is managed by knee replacementQ - Old (65 yrs) age, long standing history of pain & swelling interfering activities of daily living and grade III radiological grade of OA indicate moderately severe OA and is best managed by Total knee ahroplasty. Although it must be remembered that TKA is done only after conservative treatment measures have been exhausted. And in this case we have presumed that conservative treatment must have been tried (b/o long course) & failed. - Because ahroscopic lavage (wash out) provides symptomatic improvements in patients with normal alignment, joint space >3mmQ, stable ligaments, unicompamental OA with relevant osteophytes at the site of symptom, loose bodies, minimal Fair bank lesions, meniscal flap tear, chondral fracture/flap and outerbridge I or II lesions. And patients with bi/tri compamental OA, malalignment, irrelevant osteophytes away from symptom site, diffuse chondrosis, degenerative meniscus, significant Fair bank lesion and outbridge III or IV are poor prognostic factors for ahroscopic debridement. So obliterated joint space rules out the possibility of conservative and ahroscopic treatments. - High tibial osteotomy is indicated in physiologically young (years) and active patients with unicompamental OA of tibiofemoral jointsQ.

Intra aerial injections of hyaluronic acid & steroid may be helpful in early minimal ahritis. Ahroscopic lavage (wash out) provides symptomatic improvements in patients with normal alignment, joint space >3mmQ, stable ligaments, unicompamental OA with relevant osteophytes at the site of symptom, loose bodies, minimal Fair bank lesions, meniscal flap tear, chondral fracture/flap and outerbridge I or II lesions. And patients with bi/tri compamental OA, malalignment, irrelevant osteophytes away from symptom site, diffuse chondrosis, degenerative meniscus, significant Fair bank lesion and outbridge III or IV are poor prognostic factors for ahroscopic debridement. Total (Tricompamental) Knee Replacement (TKR): Indications - Primary indication of TKR is to relieve pain caused by severe ahritis with or without significant deformityQ. Radiological finding must correlate with clinical impression of knee ahritis. Patient who do not have complete cailage space loss before surgery tend to be less satisfied with their clinical result after TKR. - Severe pain from chondrocalcinosis & pseudogout in an elderly patient is an occasional indication of TKR in absence of complete cailage space loss. Severe patellofemoral ahritis in elderly may justify TKR because the expected outcome is better than that of patellectomy in these patients. - Osteonecrosis with subchondral collapse of femoral condyle. - Because knee replacement has a finite expected survival that is adversely affected by activity level, it generally is indicated in older patients with more sedentary life styles. It is preferable that patients undergoing TKA have a remaining normal life expectancy of between 20 & 30 years so that need for a repeat ahroplasty for a failed TKA will be minimal. It is clearly indicated in young patients who have limited function b/o systemic ahritis (eg rheumatoid ahritis) with multiple joint involvement. But the patient must understand the limitations of the procedure, be willing to modify life style to prolong the life of prosthesis and be willing to risk the lower success rate in a revision TKA. - Deformity can become the principle indication for TKR in patient with moderate ahritis & variable levels of pain when the progression of deformity begins to threaten the expected outcome of an anticipated TKR. This includes flexion contractures beyond 20deg and vurus/ valgus laxity. However, deformity without pain is not a suitable indication for surgery as it may be well tolerated by elderly. - Indications for leaving the patella unresurfaced are, a primary diagnosis of OA, satisfactory patellar cailage with no eburnated bone, congruent patello femoral tracking, a normal anatomical patellar shape and no evidence of crystalline or inflammatory ahropathy and lighter weight of patient. TKR: Contraindications - Absolute contraindications include recent or current knee infection; a remote source of ongoing infection; extensor mechanism discontinuity or severe dysfunction; recurvatum deformity secondary to muscular weakness; and presence of painless, well functioning knee ahrodesis. - Relative contraindications include fragile medical conditions, severe atherosclerotic disease of operative leg, skin conditions such as psoriasis within the operative field, venous stasis disease with recurrent cellulitis, neuropathic ahropathy, morbid obesity, recurrent UTI, and a h/o osteomyelitis in the proximity of knee.",

Chyluria is often caused by filariasis due to the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti, a thready nematode which lodges the lymph channels. Another cause is pregnancy or childbih. It may also be seen in ascariasis, malaria, tumour and tuberculosis. Once the lymph channels are blocked, one may open into the kidney hilum or ureter or sometimes into the bladder and chyle can leak into the urinary tract resulting in milky white urine. It may also result in renal colic and hypoproteinemia. Blood sometimes mixes with the urine resulting in haemato-chyluria. Usually the condition is self limiting.

But the best method is \"Orthotopic neobladders\". \"Incontinent cutaneous urinary diversion\" by ileal conduit: a segment of ileum is exteriorized in the form of a stoma through the abdominal wall, around which an appliance is secured and into which urine continuously drains. \"Continent cutaneous diversions\" - All continent cutaneous reservoirs rely upon a low-pressure pouch constructed of various detubularized bowel segments and a functional mechanism that connects the reservoir to the skin, designed to prevent involuntary urine flow. The most obvious advantages of this type of diversion are the ability to avoid continuous urine drainage and the need for an external appliance. These continent cutaneous diversions require intermittent clean self-catheterization through the stoma both to empty the reservoir and to irrigate mucous. No stomal appliance is usually required. Although continent cutaneous diversions have been largely supplanted by the orthotopic neobladder, this procedure is used when the urethra or bladder neck is non-functional or involved by tumor, and avoidance of an external appliance is desired. \"Orthotropic neobladders\"- Orthotropic neobladders are internal reservoirs that are connected to the native urethra and rely upon the external striated sphincter for continence. These reservoirs are constructed from a segment of detubularized intestine (usually ileum) anastomosed to the native urinary outflow tract. Because this approach facilitates the restoration of normal self-image by approximating normal voiding, construction of an orthotropic neobladder has become the procedure of choice for most patients following cystectomy for bladder cancer in both men and women. It is contraindicated if the urethra is nonfunctional or involved with tumor.",

She is intubated endotracheally with mechanical ventilation immediately after bih. Over the first 4 days after bih the ventilator pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen are reduced. Beginning on the fifth day after bih, she has brief desaturations that become more persistent. She needs increased ventilator and oxygen suppo on the seventh day after bih. She becomes cyanotic. Fuher examination, echocardiogram, and x-rays reveal left atrial enlargement, an enlarged pulmonary aery, increased pulmonary vasculature, and a continuous machine-like murmur. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Patent ductus aeriosus. The presence of a murmur could be indicative of any of the conditions. The presence of a continuous machine-like murmur is indicative of a patent ductus aeriosus (PDA). Usually, as in this case, the premature baby with PDA does not acutely become cyanotic and ill, although brief desaturations can occur that become more persistent. An atrial septal defect (ASD), such as a persistent foramen ovale, could be eliminated from the diagnosis because the murmur would be heard as an abnormal splitting of the second sound during expiration (answer a). A patent foramen ovale is a common echo finding in premature babies and is usually not followed up unless it appears remarkable to the pediatric cardiologist or there is a persistent murmur. A patent foramen ovale might result in only minimal or intermittent cyanosis during crying or straining to pass stool. A murmur caused by a ventricular septal defect (VSD, answer c), occurs between the first and second heart sounds (S1and S2) and is described as holosystolic (pansystolic) because the amplitude is high throughout systole. Pulmonary stenosis would be heard as a harsh systolic ejection murmur (answer d). PDA refers to the maintenance of the ductus aeriosus, a normal fetal structure. In the fetus, the ductus aeriosus allows blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation, since the lungs are not involved in CO2/O2exchange until after bih. The placenta subserves the function of gas exchange during fetal development. The ductus aeriosus shunts flow from the left pulmonary aery to the aoa. High oxygen levels after bih and the absence of prostaglandins from the placenta cause the ductus aeriosus to close in most cases within 24 hours. A PDA most often corrects itself within several months of bih, but may require infusion of indomethacin (a prostaglandin inhibitor) as a treatment, inseion of surgical plugs during catheterization, or actual surgical ligation.",

In this case there is an interruption in conduction of the impulse down the nerve fiber, and recovery takes place without true regeneration, as Wallerian degeneration does not occur.

The disruption usually occurs lateral to the cribriform plate but may also result from disruption of the sphenoidal, ethmoidal, and frontal sinuses producing a dural tear and communication with the subarachnoid space. Diagnosis of CSF leakage is often complicated by mixture with nasal secretions, lacrimal secretions, and blood. Clear CSF should be collected in a vial, an absence of sediment and a glucose level of approximately 45 mg/dL is usually confirmatory. A more specific, albeit slower, laboratory examination is the CSF-specific beta-2 transferrin test. CSF will also form concentric rings when poured on linen or soft filter paper. CSF has a more rapid diffusion than blood, leading to a larger, clearer CSF ring surrounding a sanguineous central ring. This is termed the double-ring or halo sign. When bleeding is present, one should suspect the presence of a CSF leak until proven otherwise. Once a provisional diagnosis is made, the patient should be placed in a semirecumbent position and instructed on how to minimize increases in intracranial pressure, including straining, sneezing and blowing of the nose. Meningitis is a potential complication of skull base fracture with a concomitant dural tear. The absence of leakage does not imply the absence of a tear. Reference: Fonseca 4th ed page no 437, 439",

It stas in the synol membrane, with the initial processes of edema, neovascularization, and hyperplasia of the synol lining. Proliferation of synoviocytes and macrophages causes thickening of the synol lining and, together with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and mast cells, develops into pannus. Pannus is a sheet of invasive cellular tissue that is continuous with the synol lining. As a result of the higher propoion of synoviocytes and macrophages, pannus causes erosion of bone and cailage at the margin of joints. In the hands, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and thumb interphalangeal (IP) joints are most frequently involved. The distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are involved only in the presence of a coexisting MCP or PIP disease. Tenosynovitis of the flexor tendons causes a reduction in finger flexion and grip strength. Nodular thickening in the tendon sheath may also produce a trigger finger. In osteoahritis and psoriatic ahritis, DIP is commonly involved.",

Penile angiography is not indicated in the painful, low-flow priapism. It is indicated for the high-flow, non-ischemic priapism which is painless. Priapism Priapism is defined as prolonged erection in the absence of a sexual stimulus. It can be classified into 2 types: A. Low-flow (ischaemic) priapism. features little or absent intracorporal blood flow due to veno-occlusion it represents a true compartment syndrome involving the penis manifests as painful, rigid erection cavernous blood gas values are consistent with hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis ischaemic priapism beyond 4th hour requires emergency intervention (decompression of the corpora cavernosa is recommended for counteracting the ischemic effects) B. High-flow (non-ischemic) priapism due to unregulated arterial blood flow presents with semi-rigid, painless erection Penile or perineal trauma is frequently associated cavernous blood gas values do not reveal hypoxia or acidosis Penile angiography is indicated in high-flow priapism and not in low-flow, painful priapism. Campbell Urology 8/e p845 writes- \"Penile arteriography has use as an adjunctive study to identify the presence and site of a cavernous artery fistula in the patient with nonischemic priapism. At this time, arteriography is not routinely used for diagnosis and is otherwise usually performed as part of an embolization procedure. \" About other options Peyronie's disease It is also k/a penile fibromatosis It is due to fibrous plaques in one or both corpus cavernosum. They may later calcify or ossify. It affects middle-aged and older men. Patients present with complaints of painful erection, curvature of the penis, and poor erection distal to the involved area. The penile deformity may be so severe that it prevents satisfactory vaginal penetration. Examination of the penile shaft reveals a palpable dense, fibrous plaque of varying size involving the tunica albuginea. Spontaneous remission occurs in about 50% of cases. Initially, observation and emotional support are advised. If remission does not occur, p-aminobenzoic acid powder or tablets or vitamin E tablets may be tried for several months. However these medications have limited success. Surgery is done in refractory cases-Excision of the plaque with replacement with a dermal or vein graft or tunica vaginalis graft. Penile prosthesis can be inserted after plaque incision. We are not quite sure about use of penile angiography in Peyronie' s disease. Campbell's Urology 8/e p826 writes about Peyronie's disease - \"Currently, the use of vascular testing is variable. Some centers perform duplex Doppler testing on all patients with Peyronie's disease; other centers do not perform vascular testing at all, despite that patients are routinely operated on for Peyronie's disease and, in some cases, receive prostheses as the primary treatment option. At our center, vascular testing is done on all patients who are prospective surgical candidates. Initially, these patients are examined with color Doppler ultrasonography. If the peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and resistive index are normal, the patients are not further tested. If the end-diastolic velocity and the resistive indices are not normal, our patients are tested with DICC\" What is DICC? DICC or Dynamic Infusion Cavernosometry and Cavernosography are widely accepted as the reference diagnostic techniques for evaluation of veno-occlusive dysfunction. Cavernosometry refers to a method of determining cavernosal pressure response to standardized rates and volumes of fluid infusion in order to define the presence and degree of venous leak. Cavernosography refers to a radiographic demonstration of the corpora cavernosa and their venous effluents after intracavernosal injection of dilute contrast agent. Cavernosometry and cavernosography as angiographic techniques which along with arteriography constitute the gold standard for diagnosis of vasculogenic impotence. But Campbell's urology mentions DICC separate from selective penile angiography. Thus we are not very sure about Peyronie's disease. But we are dead sure, painful priapism is not an indication for penile angiography Erectile dysfunction \"Penile arteriography is another invasive test mainly used prior to penile surgical revascularization in young men with posttraumatic surgical revascularization in young men with posttraumatic or congenital arteriogenic erectile dysfunction with on vascular risk factors, or in studying cases of high flow priapism. \"- Handbook of Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders By David L Rowland, Luca Incrocci p55 A-V malformation Well, penile A-V malformation is quite rare.

Schwaz writes- \"Numerous large retrospective and several prospective studies have now clearly demonstrated that primary repair is safe and effective in viually all patients with penetrating wounds. Colostomy is still appropriate in a few patients, but the current dilemma is how to select which patients should undergo the procedure. Currently, the overall physiologic status of the patient, rather than local factors, directs decision making. Patients with devastating left colon injuries requiring damage control are clearly candidates for temporary colostomy.

They constitute 1-1. 5% of all primary bone neoplasms. It has a peak incidence in the fifth decade (according to Maheshwari, young adults). About 50% of hemangiomas of bone occur in veebrae and are most commonly situated in lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions. Other common site of involvement (20%) is skull. Small bones of hands and feets may also be affected. Haemangioma of the veebra has a typical radiographic picture in the form of loss of horizontal striations and prominence of veebral striations. There is Polka dot appearance on CT. In the skull, hemangioma generally affects the calverium and is seen as an expansile lytic lesion which has a sunburst appearance with striation radiating from the centre. A hemangioma may be identified due to associated phlebolith and it may cause local gigantism of the invovled area. Hemangiomas are largely asymptomatic, and thus most are never discovered, leading some to describe these lesions as rare. Treatment is radiotherapy.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: USG In Europe and USA 80% of the stones are cholesterol or mixed type. In Asia, 80% of the stones are pigment stones On the basis of their contents, gallstones can be subdivided into the two following types: Cholesterol stones are usually green, but are sometimes white or yellow in color. They are made primarily of cholesterol. Pigment stones are small, dark stones made of bilirubin and calcium salts that are found in bile. Risk factors for pigment stones include hemolytic anemia, cirrhosis, biliary tract infections, and hereditary blood cell disorders, such as sickle cell anemia and spherocytosis. Mixed stones-most of these are a mixture of cholesterol and calcium salts. Because of their calcium content, they can often be visualized radiographically. Cholesterol gallstones develop when bile contains too much cholesterol and not enough bile salts. Besides a high concentration of cholesterol, two other factors seem to be impoant in causing gallstones: The first factor is how often and how well the gallbladder contracts; incomplete and infrequent emptying of the gallbladder may cause the bile to become overconcentrated and contribute to gallstone formation. The second factor is the presence of proteins in the liver and bile that either promote or inhibit cholesterol crystallization into gallstones. Increased levels of the hormone estrogen as a result of pregnancy, hormone therapy, or the use of combined (estrogen-containing) forms of hormonal contraception, may increase cholesterol levels in bile and also decrease gallbladder movement, resulting in gallstone formation. It is most common for a person to have gall stones if (s)he falls under the four F's: Fat, Female, (nearing) Foy, Feile. A diagnosis of gallstone is based on the history and physical examination with confirmatory radiological studies like USG Cholesterol gallstones can sometimes be dissolved by oral ursodeoxycholic acid. Obstruction of the common bile duct with gallstones can sometimes be relieved by endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy (ERS) following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).",

Primary lymphedema with onset before the age first year (with in two year according to L & B) of life is called is called congenital. The familial version of congenital lymphedema is known as Milroy's disease and is inherited as a dominant trait. Primary lymphedema with onset between the age of 1 and 35 years (b/w 2-35 according to L& B) is called lymphedema praecox. The familial version of familial praecox is known as Meige's disease. Primary lymphedema with onset after the age of 35 years is called lymphedema tarda. The primary lymphedema are relatively uncommon, occurring in 1 of every 10, 000 individuals. The most common form of primary of lymphedema is praecox, which accounts for about 80% of the patients. Congetital and tarda lymphedemas each account for the remaining 10%. Lymphangiosarcoma is rare tumor that develops as a complications of long-standing ( usually more than 10 years) lymphedemas. Clinically, patients present with acute worsening of the edema and appearance of subcutaneous nodules that have a propensity towards hemorrhage and ulceration. The tumor can be treated, as other sarcomas, with preoperative chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgical excision, which usually takes the form of radical amputation.

This increased pressure may compromise blood flow and lead to necrosis of the skin and pulp. There is little room for swelling, so that infection causes a throbbing pain early. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause Complications Osteomyelitis involving the diaphysis of distal phalanx is a common complication.

Nature - Usually a dull ache but may be throbbing Location - Occipito frontal * Accompanying symptoms -Nausea, stiff neck, blurred vision, photophobia, tinnitus and veigo Onset - Pain usually begins within 48hrs., but may be delayed for upto 12 days. Precipitating factors It is dramatically positional, it begins when the patient sits or stands upright Also worsened by head shaking or jugular venous compression Relief is obtained on reclining or with abdominal compression Treatment Post-LP headache usually resolves without specific treatment, and care is largely suppoive with oral analgesics and antiemetics. Patients may obtain relief by lying in a comfoable position. For some patients beverages with caffeine can provide temporary pain relief. For patients with persistent pain, - Treatment with I.

An abrasion (or a graze) is a superficial injury involving only the outer layers of the skin and not penetrating the full thickness of the epidermis.

The classical example of this is seen in traffic accidents when tyre of a motor car passes over the skin leaving the pattern when the skin has been squeezed into the grooves of the rubber tread. Pressure Abrasions (Imprint Abrasions): When the impact is veical to the skin surface, the epidermis gets crushed and pressure type of abrasions result and the imprint of the impacting object may be produced.

In contrast to inguinal hernia, femoral hernia is rare in infancy and childhood. It is rare before pubey. It is more common on right side It is bilateral in 20% of cases.

These are 1) Gastro intestinal drainage (Nasogastric suction) 2) Fluid and electrolyte replacement 3) Surgery for relief of obstruction The first two steps are always necessary prior to the surgical relief of obstruction. Surgical treatment is necessary for most cases of intestinal obstruction, but it should always be delayed until resuscitation is complete. The timing of surgical intervention is dependent on clinical picture. The classical clinical advice on a case of unrelieved intestinal obstruction is that \"Sun should not both rise and set\" i. e., the operative procedure should not be delayed beyond 24 hrs. But, there are ceain exceptions to this rule. In some cases operation is delayed in the hope of spontaneous resolution. In adhesive intestinal obstruction, usually occuring after surgery the upto 72 hours in the hope of spontaneous resolution. In these cases continued radiological evidence of obstruction.

        "exp": "Ans. B: Reduced BAO: MAO ratio Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a rare condition characterized by peptic ulcers that are refractory to conventional medical therapy. Gastrin-producing tumors or gastrinomas cause excessive gastric acid secretion, leading to ulcers of the upper GI tract, as well as diarrhea and severe abdominal pain. Laboratory studies to confirm the diagnosis of ZES include the following: Measurements of fasting serum gastrin levels - Gastrin levels higher than 100 pg, /mL are highly suggestive of ZES. If the gastric pH level is less than 2. 5, a gastrin level of higher than 1000 pg/mL is diagnostic of ZES. If the patient is not receiving acid-suppressing medication and the gastric pH levels are higher than 2, ZES can be ruled out. Secretin stimulation test After blood to measure the basal gastrin level is obtained, 2 IU/kg of secretin is intravenously administered. Blood is obtained at 2. 5 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and 30 minutes. An increase of serum gastrin levels to higher than 200 pg/mL is diagnostic of ZES. - It is the most impoant diagnostic test to exclude other conditions with increased acid secretion, hypergastrinemia, or both. - Clinical conditions in which patients present with hypergastrinemia, such as gastric outlet obstruction, pernicious anemia, renal failure, and achlorhydria due to atrophic gastritis, must be excluded with secretin provocative testing. Measurement of basal acid output - Before measurement of the basal acid output (BAO), acid-inhibitory agents must be discontinued: 24 hours for H2 receptor antagonists and 7 days for proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). - In the 24 hours prior to the test, the patient receives antacids. - In an unoperated stomach, a BAO of more than 15 m. Eq/h is diagnostic of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. If the patient underwent gastric resection for acid reduction, a BAO of more than 10 m. Eq/h is diagnostic for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. If the patient has multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), other laboratory abnormalities may be suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. - High plasma calcium levels High parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels - High prolactin levels",

However false negatives do occur, mainly through sampling error, and invasive cancer cannot be distinguished from 'in situ' disease.

The histopathologic features include small cysts lined by epithelial cells with apocrine metaplasia, calcium deposits, areas of fibrosis, increased number of acini (adenosis), and foci of florid hyperplasia of ductal epithelium. Which of these changes increase the risk of breast cancer?",
        "exp": "Fibrocystic changes usually come to clinical attention by causing pain(often cyclical, in premenstrual phase), palpable lumps, or mammographic densities and calcifications. A \"lumpy-bumpy\" texture is caused by cysts and fibrosis. Fibrocystic changes, per se, do not increase the risk of developing breast cancer, unless there are associated proliferative changes. Epithelial hyperplasia is defined as an increase in the number of epithelial cell layers in the ductal epithelium. Florid epithelial hyperplasia leads to an increased risk of developing carcinoma, especially if there is associated cellular atypia (atypical ductal hyperplasia). Adenosis refers to an increase in the number of acini and can be observed in fibrocystic changes as well as in other breast conditions, such as sclerosing adenosis. Physiologic adenosis is pa of the changes that occur during pregnancy. Adenosis is not associated with increased risk of breast cancer, except as a component of sclerosing adenosis. Apocrine metaplasia describes a benign change of breast epithelial cells that come to resemble the apocrine epithelium of sweat glands. Apocrine cells have abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. Apocrine metaplasia is seen frequently in fibrocystic changes, as well as in normal breast. Calcium deposition is a nonspecific finding that may occur in a number of both benign and malignant breast changes, including fibrocystic changes, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinoma. Calcification is not clinically significant except for its diagnostic value. Mammographic detection of calcium may serve to guide biopsy procedures. Ref: Hunt K. K., Newman L. A., Copeland E.

        "exp": "Epidural hematomas are typically caused by a tear of the middle meningeal aery or vein or a dural venous sinus. Ninety percent of epidural hematomas are associated with linear skull fractures, usually in the temporal region. The lesion appears as a hyperdense biconvex mass between the skull and brain on CT scan. The typical history is one of head trauma followed by a momentary alteration in consciousness and then a lucid interval lasting for up to a few hours. This is followed by a loss of consciousness, dilation of the pupil on the side of the epidural hematoma, and then compromise of the brainstem and death.",
