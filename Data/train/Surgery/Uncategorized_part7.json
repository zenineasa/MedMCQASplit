D: Recurrent dislocation of shoulderA Hill-Sachs lesion usually results from recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation with resultant posterolateral humeral head compression fracture as the humeral head comes to rest against the anteroinferior pa of the glenoid. It is often associated with a Banka lesion of the glenoid (stripping of the glenoidal labrum along with the periosteum from the anterior surface of the glenoid and scapular neck). Plain film. Best seen following re-location of the joint, and better appreciated on internal rotation views. It appears as a sclerotic veical line running from the top of the humeral head towards the shaft. If large then a wedge defect may be evident. CT and MRIBoth MRI and CT are very sensitive to this lesion, which appears as a region of flattening or a wedge shaped defect (with bone marrow oedema on MRI acutely) seen involving the posterolateral humeral head above the level of the coracoid. This is usually seen in the most superior few slices, were the humeral head should be rounded. It is impoant to note that below the level of the coracoid the humeral head normally flattens out posterolaterally, and this should not be misinterpreted as a Hill-Sachs lesion",

Crystalloids are aqueous solutions of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules. Colloids contain larger insoluble molecules, such as albumin; blood itself is a colloid. Colloids preserve a high colloid osmotic pressure in the blood, while, on the other hand, this parameter is decreased by crystalloids due to hemodilution. Another difference is that crystalloids generally are much cheaper than colloids. The most commonly used crystalloid fluid is normal saline, a solution of sodium chloride at 0. 9% concentration, which is close to the concentration in the blood (isotonic). Ringer's lactate or Ringer's acetate is another isotonic solution often used for large-volume fluid replacement. A solution of dextrose 5% in water, sometimes called D5W, is often used instead if the patient is at risk for having low blood sugar or high sodium.",

MRI of the brain shows dilatation of the ventricular cavities, while the cerebral coex appears normal. No infarcts are seen. Repeated lumbar punctures reveal occasional increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. A biopsy of the frontal coex demonstrates the absence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",
        "exp": "This is an \"interdisciplinary\" question, which begins with a clinical scenario and ends by testing your knowledge of pathophysiology and pharmacology. The clinical presentation has the classic triad of memory loss, urinary incontinence, and gait abnormalities characteristic of normal pressure hydrocephalus (recently renamed intermittently raised pressure hydrocephalus). This condition results from intermittent increases in CSF pressure, leading to progressive damage to cerebral white matter and dilatation of the ventricles. No significant coical atrophy is present. The lack of Alzheimer-related changes in the biopsy and the measurements of CSF pressure suppo the diagnosis. Relief of CSF pressure can be obtained by placing a ventricular shunt, which usually improves clinical symptomatology. Tacrine and other inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase are used in the symptomatic therapy of Alzheimer disease. The pathology of this disease includes degeneration of cerebral cholinergic systems, such as the basal nucleus of Meyne, which project to the neocoex and are involved in memory and learning. Acetylcholinesterase degrades acetylcholine after release from presynaptic boutons. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors therefore enhance the concentration of acetylcholine and amplify cholinergic neurotransmission. Aspirin is used to prevent aggregation and adhesion of platelets in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. Prophylactic aspirin treatment lowers the incidence of transient ischemic attacks and brain infarcts. L-DOPA is a precursor of dopamine, the neurotransmitter of the nigrostriatal neurons that degenerate in Parkinson disease. L-DOPA, especially in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, is therefore used in the treatment of this disorder. Ref: Ropper A. E., Ropper A. H. (2012). Chapter 209.

Surgery whether laparoscopy or laparotomy involves two components: i) Thorough peritoneal toilet to remove all the fluid and food debris drain is not indicated ii) Management of perforation For duodenal ulcer perforation The most frequently performed operation for a perforated duodenal ulcer is simple closure with an omental onlay reinforcement or patch.

Because medullary Ca are C-cell tumors*, they do not respond to thyroxine therapy and do not concentrate radioiodine.

Severe intra-abdominal sepsis, such as an infected Caesarean section, typhoid peritonitis, or a perforation of his large gut. Suturing of abdomen with catgut or some other absorbable suture, especially of low quality or out of date, or if abdominal wound becomes infected. Suturing in layers, taking bites of tissue that are too small. Patient is having carcinomatosis, uraemia, or obstructive jaundice. An abdomen will almost never burst if: It is sutured with a non-absorbable suture, such as steel, nylon, or polyethylene. Close its muscles with one layer of through-and-through sutures, which are not too tight and with wide bites of tissue. Use delayed skin suture if the wound is infected or potentially so. The three main post-operative causes are abdominal distension, intestinal leakage and wound infection. Leakage is impoant as it will nearly always lead to wound disruption. A serosanguinous (pink) discharge from the wound is forerunner of disruption in 50% of cases. It is the most pathognomonic sign of impending wound disruption and it signifies that intraperitoneal contents are lying extraperitoneally.",

Gene defects result in. fallure to synthesize a functional protein or in the synthesis of a dysfunctional protein.

Gene therapy tries to either modify or transfer the genes. Gene modification This involves correction of the defective poion of a genomic sequence or removal of the whole defective gene and its replacement by a normal copy. Gene transfer This involves introduction of genes without removing or altering the existing ones. Gene transfer is carried out in the following ways? i) Injection of naked D. N.

Prolonged increases in metabolic rate lead to growth of the vasculature; decreases in metabolic rate lead to vascular rarefaction, i. e., loss of capillaries as well as other types of blood vessels. In other words, blood vessels grow where they are needed and regress when they are not needed. When a limb is immobilized in a cast, the muscles are inactive and their metabolic rate decreases. This decrease in metabolic rate leads to a decrease in capillarity in the skeletal muscles by mechanisms that are poorly understood.

S. lets see other options: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH): Also k/a Forestier's disease, ankylosing hyperostosis DISH is a syndrome of excessive calcification and ossification of soft tissues. mainly ligaments and entheses, that develops with aging. There is a marked predilection to the axial skeleton, paicularly the thoracic spine. It may also involve the peripheral joints. The most characteristic radiographic abnormality of DISH is calcification and ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine. The diagnosis is made by, spinal radiographs that show \"flowing\" calcifications along the anterior and lateral poion of at least four contiguous veebral bodies without loss of disc height and without typical radiographic findings of ankylosing spondylitis. (no syndesmophytes). DISH commonly occurs in men in their fifth to sixth decade of life. Patients are often asymptomatic but may have spinal pain or limited spinal motion. DISH can be ruled out as in DISH there is no raised ESR and syndesmophytes. (ESR is raised in inflammatory spondyloahropathies like Ankylosing spondylitis. But DISH and degenerative osteoahritis are non-inflammatory conditions, so ESR would be normal.) Apley's writes- \"Although DISH bears a superficial resemblance to AS, it is not an inflammatory disease; spinal pain and stiffness are seldom severe, the sacroilitis joints are not eroded and the ESR is normal. \" Harrison writes- \"Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis which occurs in middle aged and elderly is usually not symptomatic. \" Degenerative osteoahritis of spine: It is a disease of elderly characterised by formation of large osteophytes along the anterior and lateral aspects of spine with decreased interveebral disc spaces.

Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. Male to female ratio is 2-3: 1 Strong correlation with HLA-B27 Pathology Enthesitis i. e. inflammation of the inseion points of tendons, ligaments or joint capsule on hone is one of the hallmarks of this entity of disease. Primarily affects axial (spinal) skeleton and sacroiliitis is often the earliest manifestation of A. S.. Involvement of costoveebral joints frequently occur, leading to diminished chest expansion (normal 5 cm) Peripheral joints for e. g. shoulders, and hips (root joints) are also involved in 1/3rd patients. Extraaicular manifestations like acute anterior uveitis (in 5%); rarely aoic valve disease, carditis and pulmonary fibrosis. Pathological changes proceed in three stages? 1). Inflammation with granulation tissue formation and erosion of adjacent bone. 2). Fibrosis of granulation tissue 3). Ossification of the fibrous tissue, leading to ankylosis of the joint. Clinical features Low back pain of insidious onset Duration usually less than 3 months Significant morning stiffness and improvement with exercise Limited chest expansion Diffuse tenderness over the spine and sacroiliac joints Loss of lambar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis Decreased spinal movements (especially extension) in all directions. Radiological features Cardinal and earliest sign is erosion and fuzziness of the sacroiliac joints Squaring of veebral bodies Syndesmophytes (described earlier) giving the appearance of a \"bamboo spine\". Other investigations ESR and CRP are usually elevated HLA-B27 is present in 95% of cases. Treatment General measures to maintain satisfactory posture and preserve movement.

The range of anatomic variants includes duodenal stenosis causing constipation, mucosal web with the intact muscular wall (so-called windsock deformity); two ends separated by a fibrous cord, or complete separation with a gap within the duodenum. Associated Anomalies: DA is associated with several conditions, including prematurity, Down syndrome, maternal polyhydramnios, malrotation, annular pancreas, and biliary atresia. Other anomalies, such as cardiac, renal, esophageal, and anorectal anomalies, are also common. In most cases, the duodenal obstruction is distal to the ampulla of Vater, and infants present with bilious emesis in the neonatal period. In patients with a mucosal web, the symptoms of postprandial emesis may occur later in life. Diagnosis: The classic plain abdominal radiograph of DA is termed the double-bubble sign (air-filled stomach and duodenal bulb, In cases in which there is no distal air, the diagnosis is secured, and no further studies are necessary. On the other hand, if the distal air is present, an upper gastrointestinal contrast study is performed fairly rapidly. This study is important not only to confirm the diagnosis of duodenal stenosis or atresia but also to exclude midgut volvulus, which would constitute a surgical emergency. Treatment: The management of DA is by surgical bypass of the duodenal obstruction as either a side-to-side or proximal transverse-to-distal longitudinal (diamond-shaped) duodenoduodenostomy.",

Consequently, the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is presently made given any length of endoscopically identifiable columnar mucosa that proves on biopsy to show intestinal metaplasia. While long segments of columnar mucosa without metaplasia do occur, they are uncommon and are probably congenital in origin.

But in case of Acute promyelocytic leukemia, these drugs are not used, instead Tretinoin is used for induction. It is a well known fact that acute promyelocytic leukemia may lead to D. I. C. When acute promyelocytic leukemia is treated with anthracycline and cytarabine, DIC is induced by the release of granule components of dying tumour cells. Tretinoin does not produce D. I. C., instead it may produces another complication known as retinoic acid syndrome, which occurs in the first 3 weeks of treatment and is characterized by fever, dyspnoea, chest pain, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and pericardial effusions.

More common in women (Female: Male ratio of 3: 1) Mean age of presentation is later than papillary Ca (-- 50 yrs) Multiple foci are rarely seen and lymph node involvement is much less common than in papillary carcinoma. Blood borne metastasis is common with spread to bone, lungs, liver and elsewhere. In less than 1% of cases, follicular cancers may be hyperfunctioning (warm nodule on scintiscan), leading to symptom of thyrotoxicosis. Histopathology Follicular carcinomas are usually solitary lesions, the majority of which are encapsulated. Microscopically most follicular carcinomas are composed of fairly uniform cells forming small follicles containing colloid (quite like normal thyroid). In other cases follicular differentiation may be less apparent, and there may be nests or sheets of cells without colloid. the nuclei lack the typical features of papillary Ca.",

This is also justified as 80% of bleeding is from non-variceal source (peptic ulcers, gastritis, esophagitis) In the question the clinical features of the patient indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcer. Variceal bleeding due to poal hypertension is very unlikely in the absence of moderate or massive splenomegaly (presence of mild splenomegaly is not enough evidence for variceal bleeding).

Factor Ville assay:- Factor Ville or intrinsic factor VIII can be ruled out because its deficiency is associated with bleeding. Platelet aggregation tests:? Platelet aggregation test measures platelet function Any defect in platlet function will cause clinical bleeding Platelet. function defect does not affect PTT (it affects bleeding time, BT) Ristocetin co-factor assay:- Ristocetin co: factor assays are used to detect Von wilebrand's disease Von wilebrands disease cause prolongation of PTT but it is also associated with clinical bleeding so it can be ruled out. Russel viper venom test (Dilute Russel viper venom test) (d. RVVT) Dilute Russel viper venom test is one of the test to detect lupus anticoagulant. Lupus anticoagulant is associated with prolongation in PTT and thrombosis (no bleeding) Lupus anticoagulant Lupus anticoagulants are acquired inhibitors directed against phospholipid binding proteins and are a common cause of APTT prolongation In Vivo, Lupus anticoagulant do not interfere with coagulation factor complex. formation on the platelet surface and are not usually associated with bleeding tendency, instead they are frequently associated with thrombosis. In Vitro, This prolongation results in paradoxical prolongation of phospholipid based clotting assays such as P77, kaolin clotting time and Dilute Russel viper venom antibody (d. RVVT testing). A panel of test is required to confirm the presence of lupus antico- agulant These are:? - PTT - Kaolin clotting time - Dilute Russel viper Venom test (DRVT) These are phospholipid dependent tests We have already discussed that Lupus anticoagulant act against phospholipids and in vitro this inhibition leads to prolongation of phospholipid dependent assays. Follow up testing is performed to confirm or exclude the presence of lupus anticoagulant:-These may include:- Mixing study - An equal volume of patient plasma is mixed with normal pooled plasma and a PTT or DRVVT is performed on this mixture. The basic principle is that the normal plasma contributes a sufficient amount of clotting factor to correct. for a factor deficiency. - A mixing study that corrects the APTT is characteristic of a coagulation factor where as one that does not correct indicates a factor inhibitor. Correction neutralization (with phospholipids):? - An excess of pho. spholipid is added to the patient sample and APII, DRVVT is performed. - The basic principle behind this is that lupus anticoagulant is directed against phospholipid. Hence phospholipid dependent assays are prolonged. - When excess phospholipid is added it overcomes the LA inhibition and corrects the test.",

The extent of the defect can vary from a mild glandular defect to complete defects as are observed in bladder exstrophy, diastasis of the pubic bones, or both. - In glandular epispadias, the urethra opens on the dorsal aspect of the glans, which is broad and flattened. - In the penile type, the urethral meatus, which is broad and gaping, is located between the pubic symphysis and the coronal sulcus. A distal groove usually extends from the meatus through the splayed glans. - The penopubic type has the urethral opening at the penopubic junction, and the entire penis has a distal dorsal groove extending through the glans. All types of epispadias are associated with varying degrees of dorsal chordee. Females with epispadias have a bifid clitoris and separation of the labia. Male to female ratio of epispadias is 3: 1. Incontinence due to maldevelopment of urinary sphincters is commonly associated with most epispadias except for the glandular type. Other associated anomaly is pubic diastasis as in exstrophy. Surgery is required to correct the incontinence, remove the chordee to straighten the penis, and extend the urethra out onto the glans penis.

It is caused by injury to auriculotemporal nerve, after surgical trauma to the parotid gland. Frey syndrome is thought to be due to aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibers between the otic ganglion and salivary tissue, which leads to innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels. Frey syndrome is reported by approximately 10 percent of patients, although rigorous testing may detect gustatory sweating in as many as 95 percent of patients after parotidectomy. Frey syndrome may occur from two weeks to two years after surgery due to a latency in the regeneration of parasympathetic nerve fibers; the area of involved skin may increase over time. The incidence of Frey syndrome is reduced by minimizing the parotid wound bed, placing fascial grafts between the skin and the gland bed, reconstructive techniques such as thick skin flaps, and postoperative RT. Intracutaneous injection of botulinum toxin A is an effective, well-tolerated, and long-lasting treatment for symptomatic patients; it may be repeated for recurrent symptoms.",

Often, one active site of an allosteric enzyme molecule can positively affect another active site in the same molecule. This leads to cooperativity and sigmoidal enzyme kinetics in a plot of versus. The terms competitive inhibition and noncompetitive inhibition apply to Michaelis-Menten kinetics and not to allosteric enzymes. Allosteric Regulation i. Allosteric enzyme has one catalytic site where the substrate binds and another separate allosteric site where the modifier binds (allo= other) ii. Allosteric and substrate binding sites may or may not be physically adjacent. iii. The binding of the regulatory molecule can either enhance the activity of the enzyme (allosteric activation), or inhibit the activity of the enzyme (allosteric inhibition). iv. In the former case, the regulatory molecule is known as the positive modifier and in the latter case as the negative modifier. v. The binding of substrate to one of the subunits of the enzyme may enhance substrate binding by other subunits. This effect is said to be positive co-operativity. If the binding of substrate to one of the subunits decreases the avidity of substrate binding by other sites, the effect is called negative co-operativity. vi. In most cases, a combination is observed, resulting in a sigmoid shaped curve. vii. Km is usually increased. viii. Vmax is reduced. ix. The effect of allosteric modifier is maximum at or near substrate concentration equivalent to Km. xi. When an inhibitor binds to the allosteric site, the configuration of catalytic site is modified such that substrate cannot bind properly. xii. Most allosteric enzymes possess quaternary structure.

        "exp": "Acyclovir and ganciclovir are variants of acycloguanosine and are used to treat herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus infections, respectively. Both agents are viricidal and act by interfering with viral polymerase activity. In the case of herpes simplex virus infection, the virally- coded thymidine kinase monophosphorylates the acyclovir. Cellular kinases then add two more phosphates, creating a nucleotide that is accepted by the virally-coded DNA polymerase. The structural analog is incorporated into the growing DNA chain and elongation is terminated. Ribavirin, used to treat paramyxovirus (respiratory syncytial virus) infection, works by interferring with viral messenger RNA (m. RNA) capping. Amantadine, used to treat influenza A infections, blocks viral un coating. It is most effective when given before viral infection occurs. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e. g., azidothymidine, didioxycytocine, didioxyinosine) directly interfere with normal enzyme activity. These agents are virostatic, and virus growth occurs when the agents are removed. Interferons are induced as a result of viral infection of a cell. Products of viral nucleic acid replication activate genes that code for interferons, which directly prevent virus growth by inducing an antiviral protein within virus- infected cells.",

Hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis both produce vascular injury and poal hypertension, which leads to the development of poosystemic shunts-most typically causing esophageal varices, caput medusae, and hemorrhoids. Bright red blood in stools is a classic presentation of hemorrhoids. Colorectal carcinoma generally develops in an older population, and produces occult blood loss rather than frankly bloody stools. Although diveiculosis may be an asymptomatic condition, diveiculitis is associated with significant abdominal distress, which may be accompanied by blood loss and diarrhea and/or constipation. Hyperplastic polyps are asymptomatic, non-neoplastic, polypoid growths, generally less than 5mm in diameter. They do not produce bleeding or any increased risk of carcinoma. Ref: Bullard Dunn K.

Methylene blue > Toluidine blue \"Chromoendoscopy, the intravital staining of gastrointestinal epithelia, provides additional diagnostic information with respect to the epithelial morphology and pathophysiology. Based on experience gathered mainly in Japan, chromoendoscopy is now in more widespread use, in paicular to identify preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. The most promising techniques are the depiction of squamous epithelium neoplasia of the esophagus with Lugol's solution, staining of Barrett's mucosa by methylene blue, including the potential to identify neoplasia, and the demarcation of neoplasia with indigo carmine in stomach and colon for local endoscopic resection. \"- aicle: Chromoendoscopy: From a Research Tool to Clinical Progress U. Peitz, P. Malfeheiner at website: ikel. Nr=67480 \"Chromoendoscopy involves the use of agents that enhance the distinction between diseased and normal mucosa, either by filling surface cervices or by differential uptake by diseased epithelium. Many chromoendoscopy agents have been studied in the detection of esophageal carcinoma, of which Lugol's iodine and methylene blue have been most widely studied. \"- Carcinoma of the Esophagus By Sheila C. Rankin p. 31 Chromoendoscopy involves the use of stains or dyes during endoscopy to improve the visualization and characterization of the gastrointestinal mucosa. The stains are mainly Vital dyes- Lugol's solution, methylene blue, and toluidine blue or Contrast agents- indigo carmine and dilute acetic acid solution Lugol's solution Is absorbed by glycogen containing, nonketatinized squamous epithelium. Lugol's stained tissue will characteristically turn green-brown. Any condition that depletes glycogen, including inflammation, dysplasia, and early-stage cancer, will result in an absence of uptake of the dye. Lugol's iodine is used to determine the extent of BE, and to screen for squamous esophageal cancer in high-risk populations. Methylene blue dye is taken up by the cytoplasm or absorptive cells such as the normal epithelial cells of the colon and small intestine, and goblet cells, which are present in Barrett's epithelium. It will not stain nonabsorptive normal epithelium of the stomach as is found in the cardia and fundus, or normal squamous mucosa of the esophagus. Chromoendoscopy with methylene blue has been used to screen for colonic neoplasia, to diagnose BE and to screen for areas of precursor lesions and carcinoma in the stomach. Methylene blue stains barrett's epithelium as it is taken up by the cytoplasm of goblet cells. Dysplastic change is associated with a reduction in goblet cell numbers and an increasing nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio propoional to the degree of dysplasia, and such tissues absorb methylene blue to a lesser extent than surrounding cells. Increasing grades of dysplasia may appear as heterogeneous or unstained areas, allowing targeted rather than random biopsies to be taken and have been repoed to improve the detection of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. Indigo carmine Unlike Lugol's iodine or methylene blue, indigo carmine is not taken up by tissues but instead pools in crevices between epithelial cells, thereby highlighting small lesions or irregularities in the mucosal architecture. Chromodendoscopy with indigo carmine has been used to diagnose BE, and to investigate polypoid and nonpolypoid lesion in the colon. Toluidine Blue Toluidine blue stains cellular nuclei. When applied topically it preferentially identifies malignant and inflammatory tissues, in pa because of their greater nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. It has most commonly been used for the identification of early squamous esophageal cancer.",

        "question": "Investigation of choice for acute cholecystitis: March 2010",
        "exp": "Ans. B: USG Plain Radiography: - Abdominal radiographs are usually not indicated, as most gallstones are not radio-opaque. - Chest radiographs may be performed to exclude a thoracic cause of pain and bowel perforation. Ultrasound: - Initial investigation of choice for suspected acute cholecystitis. Ultrasonographic signs of acute gallbladder inflammation include gallbladder wall thickening/oedema, pericholecystic fluid, gallstones, and positive ultrasonic Murphy's sign. - >90% diagnostic accuracy and varies with the morphologic criteria used. - Colour/power Doppler increases accuracy over Gray-scale sonography. - Advantages: allows evaluation of other abdominal structures (can identify an alternative diagnosis), provides preoperative information such as gallbladder size, stone size, gallbladder wall status, and the presence of biliary dilatation. Tc-IDA Radionuclide Scan: - Superior diagnostic accuracy and specificity compared to ultrasound. Used to clarify a negative, equivocal or technically difficult ultrasound in the presence of continued clinical suspicion of acute cholecystitis. - The hallmark of acute cholecystitis (acalculus as well as calculus) is persistent gall bladder non-visualisation 30 minutes post morphine or on the 3-4 hour delayed image. - False positives can occur in alcoholics, intensive care unit patients, patients on prolonged fasting, cystic fibrosis and chronic cholecystitis. - Morphine augmentation reduces false positives and is superior to delayed imaging. - In critically ill patients in whom acalculous cholecystitis is suggested on US, Tc-IDA scan with pretreatment cholecystokinin to empty gallbladder prior to Tc-IDA scan, or percutaneous cholecystostomy may be indicated. Post treatment Cholecystokinin can be used to evaluate gallbladder function in chronic cholecystitis. Limitations: longer examination time, unreliable in severe hepatocellular disease or at serum bilirubin levels >340-500 mmol/L, and inability to diagnose extra-biliary causes of acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain and to provide anatomical information. Other Imaging: Endoscopy or Barium studies may be indicated in ceain patients to identify alternative diagnoses which may clinically simulate acute cholecystitis. - Computed Tomography CT is useful when the clinical picture is non-specific as it can detect other intra-abdominal inflammatory processes, and when complications of acute cholecystitis are suspected. Sensitivities for CT diagnosis of acute cholecystitis have not been established CT features of acute cholecystitis include Pericholecystic inflammatory changes, including contrast enhancement of the liver adjacent to the gallbladder, inflammatory stranding of pericholecystic tissues, and pericholecystic fluid. Loss of distinction between walls of the gallbladder and adjacent liver. Gallbladder wall thickening, contrast enhancement. Gallbladder distension. Presence of gallstones. Advantages: allows other diagnoses, able to identify complications of acute cholecystitis. Limitations: exposure to ionising radiation, less sensitive (57%-88%) for detection of gallstones compared to ultrasound.",

        "question": "30 yrs female presented with unilateral breast cancer associated with axillary lymph node enlargement. Modified radical mastectomy was done, a further treatment plan will be",
        "exp": "Stage I & II breast cancers (Early invasive breast cancers ) are managed by 1. Primary therapy for local management 2. Adjuvant therapy Primary therapy consists of: Mastectomy with an assessment of axillary lymph node status (or modified radical mastectomy) or Breast conservation (lumpectomy, wide local excision or quadrantectomy) with an assessment of axillary lymph node status + radiotherapy. Various trials have found both these methods to be equally effective. Breast conservation is the preferred form of treatment because of cosmetic advantages. However, there are certain contraindications for conservative surgery (described in subsequent question) Management of axillary lymph nodes Earlier dissection of axillary lymph nodes (level I and II) was performed to assess the lymph node status (i. e. presence or absence of occult metastasis). Now Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered the standard for evaluation of the axillary lymph nodes for metastasis in women who have clinically negative lymph nodes, (the sentinel lymph node is thirst regional lymph node to receive tumor cells that metastasize along the lymphatic pathway from the primary breast cancer). Axillary Lymph node dissection is performed for clinically palpable axillary lymph nodes or metastatic disease detected in sentinel lymph node biopsy. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node-negative cancers if > 1 cm in size. Node-negative cancer >. 5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion high nuclear grade high histological grade HER 2/neuoverexpression negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive tumors. HER-2/neu expression is determined for all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and may be used to provide prognostic information in patients with node-negative breast cancer and predict the relative efficacy of various chemotherapy regimens. Trastuzumab is the HER-2/neu-targeted agent that is added to the adjuvant therapy is the tumor shows overexpression of HER-2/neu receptors. Advanced Local-Regional Breast Cancer (Stage III ) (Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + MRM + adjuvant radiation therapy + chemotherapy + antiestrogen therapy) Here the disease is advanced on the chest wall or in regional lymph nodes (or both), with no evidence of metastasis to distant sites. Such patients are recognized to be at significant risk for the development of subsequent metastases, and treatment addresses the risk for both local and systemic relapse. In an effort to provide optimal local-regional disease-free survival as well as distant disease-free survival for these women, surgery is integrated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (administration of therapeutic agents prior to the main treatment) should be considered in the initial management of all patients with locally advanced stage III breast cancer. Surgical therapy for women with stage III disease is usually a modified radical mastectomy, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Antiestrogen therapy (tamoxifen) is added for hormone receptor-positive tumors. Chemotherapy is used to maximize distant disease-free survival, whereas radiation therapy is used to maximize local-regional disease-free survival. In selected patients with stage IIIA cancer, neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy can reduce the size of primary cancer and permit breast-conserving surgery. Distant Metastases (Stage IV ) (mainly palliative treatment) Treatment for stage IV breast cancer is not curative but may prolong survival and enhance a woman's quality of life. Hormonal therapies that are associated with minimal toxicity are preferred to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Appropriate candidates for initial hormonal therapy include women with hormone receptor-positive cancers; women with bone or soft tissue metastases only; and women with limited and asymptomatic visceral metastases. Systemic chemotherapy is indicated for women with hormone receptor-negative cancers, symptomatic visceral metastases, and hormone-refractory metastases. Bisphosphonates, which may be given in addition to chemotherapy or hormone therapy, should be considered in women with bone metastases. About Adjuvant Therapy, Adjuvant therapy is the use of systemic therapy (chemotherapy or/and hormone therapy) in patients who have received local therapy but are at risk of relapse. The objective is to eliminate the occult metastasis responsible for late recurrences while they are microscopic and theoretically most vulnerable to anticancer agents. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node-negative cancers if > 1 cm in size node-negative cancer >. 5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion high nuclear grade high histological grade HER 2/neuover expression negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive. The use of chemotherapy in postmenopausal women is controversial. In postmenopausal women, chemotherapy is frequently used upto age 70 yrs, if she can tolerate it. In older women, chemotherapy is performed less frequently. In estrogen-positive tumors, in postmenopausal women, antiestrogen (tamoxifen / aromatase inhibitors) Therapy is the preferred form of adjuvant systemic treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy it involves the administration of adjuvant therapy before primary therapy (surgery & radiation therapy) it has shown to down-stage the tumor. Previously CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate & 5 - fluorouracil) was the chemotherapeutic regimen of choice. \"CMF is no longer considered adequate adjuvant chemotherapy and modem regimens include an anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) and the newer agents such as the taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel)\"- Bailey and Love 25/e p844 Anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy. (Trastuzumab) HER-2/neu expression for all newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer is now recommended.

Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node negative cancers if > 1 cm in size node negative cancer >. 5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion - high nuclear grade - high histological grade - HER 2/neu overexpression - negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive. The use of chemotherapy in post-menopausal women is controversial. - In post menopausal women, chemotherapy is frequently used upto age 70 yrs, if she can tolerate it. - In older women, chemotherapy is performed less frequently. - In estrogen positive tumors, in postmenopausal women, antiestrogen (tamoxifen/ aromatase inhibitors) therapy is the preferred form of adjuvant systemic treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy - it involves the administration of adjuvant therapy before primary therapy (surgery & radiation therapy) - it has shown to down-stage the tumor.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Popliteus Locking and Unlocking of knee joint Locking is a mechanism that allows the knee to remain in the position of full extension as in standing without much muscular effo. Locking occurs as a result of medial rotation of the femur during the last stage of extension. The anteroposterior diameter of the lateral femoral condyle is less than that of the medial condyle. As a result, when the lateral condylar aicular surface is fully 'used up' by extension, pa of the medial condylar surface remains unused. At this stage the lateral condyle rotates backwards, i. e. medial rotation of the femur occurs, so that the remaining pa of the media condylar surface is also 'taken up'. This movement locks the knee joint. Locking is aided by the oblique pull of ligaments during the last stages of extension. When the knee is locked, it is completely rigid and all ligaments of the joint are taut. Locking is produced by continued action of the same muscles that produce extension, i. e. the quadriceps femoris, especially the vastus medialis pa. The locked knee joint can be flexed only after it is unlocked by a reversal of the medial rotation, i. e. by lateral rotation of the femur. Unlocking is brought about by the action of the popliteus muscle. Physiological locking ----> Qudriceps femoris Physiological unlocking --> Popliteus",

Although elevated gastric acid secretion may be noted in patients with stress ulceration after head trauma (Cushing's ulcer) and severe burns (Curling's ulcer), mucosal ischemia and breakdown of the normal protective barriers of the stomach also play an impoant role in the pathogenesis.

Early repair causes retarded maxillary growth (probably due to trauma to growth center and periosteum of the maxilla during surgery if done early). Late repair causes speech defect. Abnormal insertion of tensor palati is released. Wardill- Kilner push back operation-by raising mucoperiosteum flaps based on greater palatine vessels. The exact timing of repair of a palate cleft is controversial. In general, the velum must be closed before the development of speech sounds that require an intact palate.

Pancreatic calcifications may be seen concurrently in approximately 2% of patients who have chronic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic carcinoma. Upper GI barium studies may reveal an extrinsic impression of the mass on the posteroinferior aspect of the antrum of the stomach. This is known as antral pad sign. The medial margin of the descending duodenum may be pulled medially at the level of the ampulla, forming a reversed-3 appearance. This is known as Frostberg 3 sign.

The term bezoars derives from the Arabic word Badzehr, which means antidote. Bezoars were used as antidotes and as magical medicinal agents against plague, snake-bite, sexual weakness, leprosy and epilepsy by physicians from 12th to 18th century. It can be trichobezoar or hairball, phytobezoar (food paicles/vegetable matter), trichphytobezoar (mixed), pharmacobezoar, lactobezoar, mycobezoar or pseudobezoar. Generally trichobezoars are in the stomach, but it may descend from the stomach into the intestine as far down as transverse colon termed as Rapunzel syndrome. The common presentation is as mobile and well defined lumps. They may present with malaise, weight loss, vague abdominal pain related to meals, anorexia, halitosis, vomiting, wasting and cachexia. They may cause a number of complications including gastritis, occult blood loss and secondary anemia, ulceration, perforation, obstruction, hemorrhage and intussusception. Diagnosis of trichobezoars rest on the clinical evidence of long standing trichophagy, abdominal mass and radiological investigations or CT scan and abdominal ultrasound but obtaining pieces of matted hair through endoscope is pathognomonic. Surgical removal at laparotomy or laparoscopeically is the treatment of choice. If small, they may be removed endoscopically. Biopsy devices, water jets, bezotomes and LASER devices may be used to fragment larger bezoars and lavaged out of the stomach. Counseling by a psychiatrist has an impoant role in the management to prevent recurrence. In any young girl, presenting with epigastric pain, vomiting and abdominal mass, trichbezoars should be considered as differential diagnosis",

Abdominal xrays reveal gaseous distention of the large and small bowel and occasionally of the stomach. Air-fluid levels are unusual and should raise the possibility of mechanical obstruction. \" Acute pseudoobstruction involves only the colon and presents with features of colonic obstruction (as described before).

Appendectomy. Obstruction in a patient with malrotation can occur because of mid gut volvulus or because of bands (Ladd's band). Midgut volvulus can occur at any age, although it is seen most often in the first few weeks of life. Bilious vomiting is usually the first sign of volvulus, and all infants with bilious vomiting must be evaluated rapidly to ensure that they do not have intestinal malrotation with volvulus. When volvulus is suspected, early surgical intervention is done to avoid or reverse the ischemic process. Surgery: Volvulus occurs clockwise, and it is therefore untwisted counterclockwise. (This can be remembered by using the memory aid \"Turn back the hands of time. \") Subsequently, Ladd's procedure is performed. This operation does not correct the malrotation but does broaden the narrow mesenteric pedicle to prevent volvulus from recurring. Steps done in Ladd's procedure are: - duodenal and cecal bands are divided, - Broadening of the mesentery - The appendix is removed to avoid diagnostic errors in later life. This maneuver brings the straightened duodenum into the right lower quadrant and the cecum into the left lower quadrant. Note that: A subset of patients with malrotation can also present with incomplete obstruction or chronic obstruction. (so the patient here in this question has either incomplete volvulus or obstruction because of-duodenal hand) Ladd's procedure is performed to prevent voluvulus; however, volvulus can still occur rarely after Ladd's procedure.",

        "exp": "Papillary Carcinoma of Thyroid: Accounts for 80% of all thyroid malignancies in iodine-sufficient areas. MC thyroid cancer in children and individuals exposed to external radiation. More often in women, 30-40 years. Pathology: Grossly: Hard and whitish and remain flat on sectioning with a blade with macroscopic calcification, necrosis, or cystic changes. Multifocality is common (up to 85% of cases) on microscopic examination. Multifocality is associated with an increased risk of cervical nodal metastases. Rarely invade adjacent structures such as the trachea, esophagus, and RLN. Rarely encapsulated (PCT are seldom encapsulated). Other variants: Tall cell, insular, columnar, diffuse sclerosing, clear cell, trabecular, and poorly differentiated types; account for about 1%; associated with a worse prognosis. Histological characteristics of Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid: Papillary projections: PTC contains branching papillae of cuboidal epithelial cells Orphan Annie eyed nuclei: The nuclei contain finely dispersed chromatin, which imparts an optically clear or empty appearance, giving rise to term ground glass or Orphan Annie eyed nuclei. Invaginations of cytoplasm in cross-sections: Intranuclear inclusions (pseudo-inclusion) or intranuclear grooves. Diagnosis of PTC is based on these nuclear characteristics even in the absence of papillary structures. Psammoma bodies: Microscopic, calcified deposits representing clumps of sloughed cells. Clinical Features: Most patients are euthyroid and present with a slow-growing painless mass in the neck. Dysphagia, dyspnea and dysphonia are associated with locally advanced invasive disease. Lymph node metastases are common, especially in children and young adults, and may be the presenting complaint. \"Lateral aberrant thyroid\" almost always denotes a cervical lymph node that has been invaded by metastatic cancer. Distant metastases are uncommon at initial presentation, but may ultimately develop in up to 20% of patients. The MC sites of metastasis: Lungs >bone >liver >brain. Diagnosis: Diagnosis is established by FNAC of the thyroid mass or lymph node. Once thyroid cancer is diagnosed on FNAC, a complete neck ultrasound to evaluate the contralateral lobe and for LN metastases in the central and lateral neck compartments. Treatment: Total or near-total thyroidectomy During thyroidectomy, enlarged central neck nodes should be removed. Biopsy-proven lymph node metastases detected clinically or by imaging in the lateral neck in patients with papillary carcinoma are managed with modified radical neck dissection.

Normal findings on chest and abdominal radiographs do not exclude splenic injury. USG/Focused abdominal sonar for trauma (FAST) is commonly used as the bedside investigation of choice for detection of intra-abdominal blood in abdominal trauma. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is especially useful in the hypotensive, unstable patient with multiple injuries as a means of excluding intrabdominal bleeding. DPL has been largely replaced by FAST. It is extremely sensitive to the presence of intra-peritoneal bleeding, being able to pick up just 20m1 of blood (Sensitivity 85-98%) Relative contraindications to DPL include near term pregnancy (DPL should be carried out supra-umbilically in this situation), presence of a coagulopathy, cirrhosis, and multiple prior abdominal operations. A DPL is deemed positive if blood or bowel contents are aspirated from the abdomen. It is also determined to be positive if on analysis of the dialysate, greater than 100, 000 RBC/mml or 5000 WBC/ mm3 are found. False positives on DPL may occur from abdominal wall bleeding from a traumatic catheter placement and from pelvic fractures. CT is the modality of choice for evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma in stable patient because it is not only sensitive, but also has a high specificity. In addition to being able to identify the presence of intra-abdominal fluid, individual organ damage can be identified. Retroperitoneal trauma may be identified and tril trauma not requiring laparotomy may be diagnosed as such.",

        "question": "Which of the following condition is not indicated for surgical exposure of orbital floor in ZMC fracture?",
        "exp": "The decision to intervene should be based on signs, symptoms, and functional impairment. The decision need not be made hastily because ZMC fractures are not emergencies and treatment can be delayed, if necessary. However, during the first week following trauma, the soft tissue undergoes changes consistent with the usual sequence of wound healing. The form that they will ultimately take depends on the underlying bony architecture. Optimally, fractures are treated before the onset of edema from the traumatic incident. In practice, however, such timing of treatment is rarely possible. When edema is moderate to severe, postponement of surgery for several days makes thorough examination and surgical treatment reliable and much easier tasks. Therefore, postponement of the decision to operate until facial edema resolves is recommended when the necessity for intervention is questionable. This approach may be used in fractures that are minimally displaced, when radiographic examination of the internal orbit shows no major defects. However, if the radiographic findings are so dramatic that intervention is definitely necessary, it may be advantageous to perform the surgery regardless of the facial edema present, because the final soft tissue contour may be superior to that which may occur when surgery is postponed. If the surgeon decides not to intervene, the patient should be observed for 2 to 3 weeks and a soft diet should be prescribed. One should always remember that if a force is sufficient to produce a fracture of the zygoma, it is also sufficient to produce intracranial injuries. ZMC fractures are not life-threatening injuries and should not be given priority over more acute problems. Treatment need not be hastened if the neurologic state of the patient is in question because zygomatic fractures can be satisfactorily treated in several days, after the facial edema has resolved.

He has symmetrical hyporeflexia of the legs, but his sensorium is completely intact. Scanning his cha, the physician notes that he was treated 10 days previously for an upper respiratory tract infection. The immunological response producing the patient's symptoms is most intense at which of the following locations?",
        "exp": "The patient has developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, also known as inflammatory polyneuropathy. This presentation is classic-rapidly evolving limb weakness with symmetrical hyporeflexia but normal sensation. The syndrome frequently follows viral infections and may evolve into complete paralysis with respiratory failure. Guillain-Barre syndrome is thought to be an autoimmune disease. The clinical course is correlated with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate and demyelination of peripheral nerves, especially spinal and cranial motor nerve roots. Inflammation localized to a small poion of spinal cord (lateral coicospinal tracts) or cerebral coex (precentral gyrus) may occur in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or in multiple sclerosis (MS). PML occurs in the immunosuppressed, and MS presents with hyperreflexia (upper motor neuron signs). The classic autoimmune disease involving the neuromuscular junction is myasthenia gravis. Although the weakness caused by myasthenia gravis may affect the legs, extraocular muscles are involved in the majority of cases, and isolated limb weakness is rare. Ref: Smith M. L., Bauman J.

Thus, if the limb is not grossly ischemic, reduction and fixation of fractures is performed first. If the limb is ischemic, a temporary intraluminal shunt is inseed to maintain distal perfusion during the ohopedic procedure. \"",
