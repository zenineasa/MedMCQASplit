Explanation:- Incisional hernias have the highest recurrence rate if managed with primary repair. Incisional Hernia. Primary repair of incisional hernias can be done. When the defect is small <d\"2 to 3 cm in diameter) and there is viable surrounding tissue. In cases in which the hernia was clearly a result of a technical error at the initial operation, such as a suture fracturing. Larger defects (>2 to 3 cm in diameter) have a high recurrence rate if closed primarily and are repaired with a prosthesis. Recurrence rates vary between 10% and 50% and are typically reduced by more than 50% with the use of prosthetic mesh. Epigastric hernias2-3 times more common in men. Located between the xiphoid process and umbilicus and are usually within 5 to 6 cm of the umbilicus. Common in individuals with a single aponeurotic decussation. The defects are small and often produce pain out of proportion to their size because of incarceration of preperitoneal fat. Multiple in up to 20% of patients and approximately 80% are in the midline. Repair usually consists of excision of the incarcerated preperitoneal tissue and simple closure of the fascial defect, similar to that for umbilical hernias. Small defects can be repaired under local anesthesia. Uncommonly, these defects can be sizable, can contain omentum or other intra-abdominal viscera, and may require mesh repairs. Spigelian hernia. It occurs through the spigelian fascia, which is composed of the aponeurotic layer between the rectus muscle medially and semilunar line laterally. Almost alt spigelian hernias occur at or below the arcuate line. The absence of posterior rectus fascia may contribute to an inherent weakness in this area. These hernias are often interparietal, with the hernia sac dissecting posterior to the external oblique aponeurosis. Clinical features and diagnosis. Most Spigelian hernias are small 11 to 2 cm in diameter) and develop during the 4-7th decades of life. Patients often present with localized pain in the area without a bulge because the hernia lies beneath the intact external oblique aponeurosis. Ultrasound ur CT of the abdomen can be useful to establish the diagnosis. ManagementA spigelian hernia is repaired because of the risk for incarceration associated with its relatively narrow neck. The hernia site is marked before operation. Larger defects are repaired using mesh prosthesis. Recurrence is uncommon. Femoral herniaA femoral hernia occurs through the femoral canal, which is bounded superiorly by the iliopubic tract, interiorly by Cooper's ligament, laterally by the femoral vein, and medially by the junction of the iliopubic tract and Cooper's ligament (lacunar ligament!. Recurrence of femoral hernia after operation is only 2%. There are three approaches to femoral hernia repair. The low operation (Lockwood). The sac is dissected out below the inguinal ligament via a groin crease incision. The high (Mc. Evedy) operation Classically, a vertical incision is made over the femoral canal and continued upwards above the inguinal ligament. Lotheissen's operation (Inguinal Approach). The inguinal canal is opened as for inguinal herniorrhaphy.",

Management of hydrocele of the hernia sac (congenital hydrocele) in a 3 years old child is herniotomy. \"A patent processus vaginalis may allow only peritoneal fluid to track down around the testis to form a hydrocoele. Hydrocoeles are unilateral or bilateral, asymptomatic, non-tender scrotal swellings. They may be tense or lax. but typically transilluminate. The majority resolve spontaneously as the processus continues to obliterate, but surgical ligation is recommended in boys older than three years of age. \"--Bailey 26/e p111\"In congenital hydrocele, the processus vaginalis is patent and connects with the peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents. Pressure on the hydrocele does not always empty it but the hydrocele fluid may drain into the peritoneal cavity when the child is lying down; thus, the hydrocele may be intermittent. Ascites should be considered if the swelling are bilateral. Congenital hydroceles are treated by herniotomy if they do not resolve spontaneously. \" Bailey 26/e p1382. Herniotomy.
