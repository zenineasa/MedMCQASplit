Treatmento With the availability of a variety of covered stents, their use will likely be considered the first treatment option, especially in the presence of a pseudoaneurysm or if the underlying injured subclavian artery has an associated dissection. However, in very young patients or those with sepsis, or when significant branch vessels may be compromised by a covered stent, other management techniques can be employed. Use of arterial closure devices can be attempted, especially when the distance from the skin to the artery tract is less than 5 cm and access to the artery is still available. Tract embolization with Gelfoam can be employed.",
