Classically, the cyst moves upwards on swallowing and with tongue protrusion.* Treatment must include excision of the whole thyroglossal tract, which involves removal of the body of the hyoid bone and the suprahyoid tract through the tongue base to the vallecula at the site of the primitive foramen caecum, together with a core of tissue on either side. This operation is known as Sistrunk's operation and prevents recurrence, most notably from small side branches of the thyroglossal tract.",

The remainder (20 - 25%) occurs in the setting of MEN syndromes 2A or 2B or as familial tumors without an associated MEN syndrome.# The sporadic MTCs tend to originate in one lobe, whereas bilateralityand multicentricity is common in familial cases.# The familial cases are also associated with C-cell hyperplasia, which is considered premalignant lesion of MTC.# Familial cases occur at a younger age, even childhood. Sporadic cases are seen in 6th decade.* RET proto-oncogenes are known to play an important role in the development of both familial & sporadic MTCs.* Patients with MTC often present with a neck mass that may be associated with palpable cervical lymphadenopathy (early spread to lymphatics is common)* Diarrhoea is a feature in 30% of cases and this may be due to 5-hydroxytryptamine or prostaglandins produced by the tumour cells. (Ref: B & L 25th/e p.797)* Distal blood-borne metastasis to the liver, bone (frequently osteoblastic), and lung occur late in the disease.* Diagnosis is established by:a) FNAC - presence of amyloid stroma is diagnostic.b) raised serum calcitonin and CEA levels (Calcitonin is a more sensitive tumor marker, but CEA is a better predictor of prognosis)c) As it is not possible to distinguish sporadic from familial disease at initial presentation, all new patients with MTC should be screened for:# RET point mutations# Pheochromocytoma (24 hr urinary levels of VMA, catecholamine &metanephrine)# Hyperparathyroidism (serum calcium)* (It is important to rule out a coexisting pheochromocytoma to avoid precipitating a hypertensive crisis & death during surgery)Also remember* MTC tumors don't take up radioiodine and are not hormone dependent",

        "exp": "Ans. b (Follicular). (Ref. Bailey and Love, 25th/797; Harrison's Medicine 16th/pg.2125)There are 4 main types of thyroid carcinoma:# Papillary carcinoma (lymphadenopathy and lateral aberrant thyroid, psammoma bodies & Orphan Annie eyed nuclei)# Follicular and hurthle cell carcinoma (May develop in patients with multinodular goitre, blood borne metastasis, bone secondaries most common in Hurthle cell variety, radioactive iodine may be useful in treatment). Hurthle cell tumours are a variant of follicular neoplasm in which oxyphil (Hurthle, Askanazy) cells predominate histologically and it carries poor prognosis.# Medullary carcinoma (may be associated with MEN 2A and 2B and amyloidosis)# Anaplastic carcinoma (worst prognosis): Local infiltration is an early feature of these tumours, with spread by lymphatics and by the bloodstream. They are extremely lethal tumours. Some of these aggressive lesions present in an advanced stage with tracheal obstruction and they require urgent tracheal decompression. The trachea may be decompressed and tissue obtained for histology by isthrnusectomy. Tracheostomy is best avoided. Radiotherapy should be given in all cases and may provide a worthwhile period of palliation.- B-cell lymphoma of thyroid may be predisposed by hashimoto's thyroiditis# Most patients with stage 1 PTC (Papillary thyroid cancer) with primary tumors < 1.5 cm in size can be managed safely with thyroxine suppression, without radiation treatment, as the risk of recurrence and mortality is very low.# For patients with FTC (follicular thyroid cancer), larger PTCs, spread to the adjacent lymph nodes, or evidence of metastases, thyroid ablation and radioiodine treatment are generally indicated.",

The remainder occurs in the setting of MEN syndrome 2A or 2B or as familial tumors without an associated MEN syndrome.* Activating point mutations in the RET proto-oncogene play an important role in the development of both familial and sporadic medullary carcinomas.",
