The patient is instructed to- inspire maximally and hold his or her breath- the neck is fully extended and - the head is turned toward the affected side. A decrease or loss of the ipsilateral radial pulse suggests compression. This test causes narrowing of the space between the scalenus anticus and medius, resulting in compression of the subclavian artery and the brachial plexus. The Halsted (Costoclavicular) Test. The patient is instructed to place his or her shoulders in a military position (drawn backward and downward). This manoeuvre narrows the costoclavicular space between the first rib and the clavicle, there by causing neurovascular compression. A decrease or loss of the ipsilateral radial pulse or reproduction of symptoms suggests compression. The Wright (Hyperabduction) Test. The patient's arm is hyperabducted 180 degrees. Compression is suspected with decrease or loss of the radial pulse. The Wright (Hyperabduction) test causes the neurovascular structures to be compressed in the subcoracoid region by the pectoralis tendon, the head of the humerus, or the coracoid process. The Roos Test (Arm claudication test). The patient abducts his or her arm 90 degrees with external rotation of the shoulder. Reproduction of symptoms suggests compression. Additionally, neurogenic compromise may be detected using provocative tests such as percussion Maintaining this body position, he exercise his hands (performed by opening and closing the hand rapidly for 3 minutes in an attempt to reproduce symptoms.)of the nerve (Tinefs sign) or flexion of the elbow or wrist (Phalen's sign).",
