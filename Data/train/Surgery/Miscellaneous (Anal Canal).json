The patient's legs are placed into stirrups, with the knees bent such that the lower legs are parallel to the plane of the torso. The lithotomy position is used for a variety of open and endoscopic urologic procedures. Therefore, an under- standing of potential postoperative complications related to this position is essential to the care of these patients. In addition to neurologic complications, which are discussed here, other complications that have been reported after procedures in the lithotomy position include lower extremity compartment syndrome, venous thrombosis, and rhabdomyolysis.",
