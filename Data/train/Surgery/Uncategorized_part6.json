        "exp": "The clinical features and laboratory results of the patient described in the question are most compatible with the diagnosis of osteoahritis (degenerative joint disease). Loss of joint cailage and bony hyperophy account for the typical radiographic findings. Early fibrillation of the aicular cailage leads to fissuring and decreased cailage in the joint. Subchondral bone increases in thickness, becomes sclerotic, and forms osteophytes. Cystic areas develop below the joint surface and become filled with fibrous tissue (pseudocysts). The synovium contains inflammatory cells, and the joint capsule proliferates and fibrosis. Osteoporosis is not a feature of osteoahritis. Ref: Felson D. T. (2013). Chapter 43. Osteoahritis. In J. B.

Ischaemic renal dysfunction secondary to hypotension and diminished renal perfusion results in acute tubular necrosis and uraemia. \" Pathophysiology Crush injury can follow prolonged continuous pressure on muscle tissue. Crush injury can lead to crush syndrome. Ischaemia reperfusion (when the pressure is released. from the crushed limb) is the main mechanism of muscle injury in crush syndrome. There is traumatic rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle fibres with the leakage of potentially toxic cellular contents into the systemic circulation. Muscle injury causes large quantities of potassium, phosphate, myoglobin, creatine kinase and urate to leak into the circulation. Myoglobin levels in the plasma are normally very low. If a significant amount of skeletal muscle is damaged (>100 g) excess myoglobin is. filtered by the kidneys and can cause renal tubular obstruction and renal damage: the excess myoglobin is nephrotoxic. intravascular volume depletion and renal hypoperfusion, combined with myoglobinuria, result in renal dysfunction. 2 Crush syndrome is characterised by Hypovolaemic shock (due to sequestration of water in the injured muscle cells). Hyperkalaemia (release of cellular potassium by the injured muscle cells). This can also lead to: - Metabolic acidosis (release of cellular phosphate and sulphate by the injured muscle cells) - Acute renal failure - Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) The key clinical_ features of crush syndrome are: Crushing injury to a large mass of skeletal muscle.

The clinical presentation of a mucocele is nonspecific, and often it is an incidental finding at operation for acute appendicitis. An intact mucocele presents no future risk for the patient; however, rupture may lead to pseudomyxoma peritonei or mucinous carcinomatosis of appendiceal origin Every effo is made to keep the mucocele intact during extraction, including placing the specimen in a bag and conveing a laparoscopic procedure to open. Management of Mucocele: Includes resection of the appendix, plus wide resection of the mesoappendix to include all the appendiceal lymph nodes, collection and cytologic examination of all intraperitoneal mucus, and careful inspection of the base of the appendix.

Prazosin, Terazosin (a, blockers) & Tamsulosin, Alf blockers) b) 5 a reductase inhibitors - eg. Finasteride, Dutasteride, Triptorelin pamoate a-Adrenergic blockers Since activation of a, receptors in the bladder neck, prostate and prostatic urethra increases their smooth muscle tone, their blockade relaxes these structures, reducing the dynamic obstruction and increasing the urinary flow rate. 5a reductase inhibitor These drugs prevent the conversion of testosterone into more active dihydrotestosterone responsible for androgen action in many tissues including prostate. Their use results in reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptom. But six months of therapy is required to see the maximum effect on prostate size and symptomatic improvement and symptomatic improvement is seen only in men with enlarged prostate (> 40 cm3) Ref Smith's Urology 17/e. Since the patient in the question needs to relieve him of his symptoms till he gets fit to be operated, an a blocker (Terazocin) would be used. a-blockers afford faster and greater symptomatic relief than finasteride. The bad point about a blocker is that their effect lasts only till drug is given and even with continued therapy, benefits may decline after several years due to disease progression. About Combination therapy Combination of both these class of drugs is used by surgeons to derive combined benefit from both; its use is not justified in this patient as he needs to alleivate his symptoms till he gets operated - the definitive & most effective t/t.",

        "exp": "Unilateral, spontaneous, serous or serosanguinous discharge from the single duct is usually caused by an intraductal papilloma or rarely, by an intraductal cancer. Mostly the underlying cause is a ductal papilloma or ductal ectasia, but since the chances of malignancies are high, it must be investigated fuher. The risk of malignancy is increased if an underlying mass is present. Also know: Investigation used are: 1. Mammography: can show any underlying suspicious lesion 2. Cytological examination: this may identify malignant cells, but a negative finding does not rule out cancer. 3. Galactography/ductography: The primary indication of the ductography is nipple discharge, paicularly when bloody. Ductography though helpful in reaching a diagnosis is not essential, since excision of the bloody ductal system is needed regardless of the diagnosis. In ductography, a contrast medium is injected into the duct and a mammogram taken. This may show an intraductal papilloma as a filling defect surrounded by contrast. Cancers may appear as irregular or as multiple intraluminal filling defects, or abrupt obstruction. Ductal ectasia or fibrocystic disease may appear as dilated cystic structures. USG may show underlying mass or ductal ectasia. The final diagnosis is made by excising the involved duct (microdochectomy) and any underlying mass if present and subjecting them to a histopathological diagnosis. Radical duct excision (meaning removal of all lactiferous duct) is not done. Ref: CSDT 12/e, page 299.",

Remember these basic points about the t/t of head and neck cancers and one can apply them to all tumors of head and neck. a) Treatment of localized head and neck cancers - These tumors are treated with curative intent either with surgery or radiotherapy. The choice of modality differs according to anatomic location and institutional expertise. In early laryngeal cancer generally, radiotherapy is done to preserve voice while in early oral cavity cancers, surgery is preferred to avoid the long-term complication of radiation such as xerostomia and dental decay. b) Locally or advanced regional disease - Combined modality therapy including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy is used. Concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy appear to be most effective. c) Recurrent or metastatic disease - chemotherapy is used. Management of neck lymph nodes The neck lymph nodes should be treated when there are clinically positive nodes or the risk for occult disease is high based on the location and stage of the primary lesion. The decision to perform neck dissection or irradiate the neck is related to the treatment of the primary lesion. If the primary tumor is being treated with radiation and the neck is N0 or N1, the nodes are usually treated with irradiation. For surgically treated primary lesions, N0 or N1 neck disease may be treated surgically as well (Radical neck dissection/Modified neck dissection/Selective neck dissection). Negative prognostic factors such as extracapsular spread of tumor, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, fixation to surrounding structures, and multiple positive nodes are indicators for postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' ie. Abdominoperineal resection Treatment of rectal cancer Surgical and oncologic management varies greatly depending on the stage and location of the tumor within the rectum. Superficially invasive, small cancers may be managed effectively with local excision. However, most patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require major surgery, such as Low anterior resection (LAR) or APR. a) Low anterior resection: This is sphincter saving procedure. In this procedure the sigmoid colon and proximal rectum are removed The descending colon is anastomosed to the distal rectum. Previously this sphincter saving LAR procedure was possible for lesions confined in upper 2/3'd of rectum. Lesions in lower third were treated with APR with permanent colostomy. With the introduction of stapling gun, the sphincter saving LAR operation can now be done even in lesions of lower 1/3 rectum, provided a margin of 2 cm or more of normal bowel can be resected below the lesion but above the dentate line. (some books write that even 1cm margin can be adequate, but provided the carcinoma is well differentiated) Devito Oncology writes- \"Tumors within 1 to 2 cm of the dentate line, that is those that can be removed with at least a 1-cm distal margin, can be resected and intestinal continuity restored with a coloanal azzastomosis. \" b) Abdominoperineal resection (also k/a Miles procedure): There is complete excision of the distal sigmoid colon, rectum and anus, by concomitant dissection through the abdomen and perineum with creation of a permanent colostomy. APR is performed when adequate distal margins for low anterior resection cannot be obtained i. e. for carcinomas in lower rectum. c) Local excision: In carefully selected patients with small, well differentiated, superficial, mobile polypoid lesions, a full thickness excision can be performed through the transanal route as the definitive therapy. Local excision can be done for selected T1 and T2 lesions without evidence of nodal disease. Transanal excision can spare the patient the morbidity of a more extensive rectal resection. However, it does not stage the nodal drainage areas and therefore cannot provide as complete staging and management of the tumor as a definitive resection. Tumors considered for local excision must meet a number of criteria to minimize the risk of local regional recurrence. Devita's Oncology writes- \"Generally, local excision is limited to tumors within 8 to 10 cm of the anal verge, encompass less than 40% of circumference of the bowel wall, are of well or moderately well differentiated histology, and have no pathological evidence of venous or lymphatic vessel invasion on biopsy. \" Various technical approaches have been described to achieve transanal local excision, including use of a special proctoscope equipped with a magnifying camera (transanal endoscopic microsurgery). Transanal endoscopic microsurgery makes use of a specially designed proctoscope, magnifying system, and instruments similar to those used in laparoscopy to allow local excision of lesions higher in the proximal rectum. d) Palliative procedures: Unresectable rectal cancers can be palliated by fulgration (electrocoagulation) or laser photocoagulation. e) Chemoradiation: Chemoradiation can be given as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Also know: Haman's procedure This is a compromise type of resection in which the rectum and/or sigmoid colon are resected and an end colostomy done. Anastomosis and perineal dissection of the distal rectum and perineum are not done. This procedure is used - if there is too much obstruction or sepsis to allow a safe anastomosis. - for elderly or severly unstable pts. who would not stand a lengthy ant resesction or an APR procedure. In this pt. the tumor lies 3. 5 cms above the anal verge (the lower limit is taken into consideration). Dentate line is 2 cm from the anal verge (Ref: Devito Oncology 8/e), so this lesion is just about 1. 5 cm above the dentate line. A minimum margin of 2 cm is required below the tumor for sphincter saving LAR, so this patient will have to go an APR procedure to remove the tumor.",

Apprehension test (Crank test) - this is a provocative test in which the examiner cautiously lifts the arm into abduction, external rotation and then extension, at the crucial moment the patient senses that the humeral head is about to slip out anteriorly and his body tautens in apprehension. Relocation test - this test involves placing the shoulder in the position of apprehension and applying a posteriorly directed force on the humeral head. The result is considered positive if this relieves the patient's apprehension. Fulcrum test- With the patient supine, the clinician takes the shoulder into 90 degrees abduction and adds lateral rotation and extension. The test indicates anterior instability if the patient becomes apprehensive. Tests for Posterior shoulder instability Jerk test- With the patient sitting and the shoulder abducted to 90 degrees and medially rotated, the clinician applies a longitudinal cephalad force to the humerus and moves the arm into horizontal flexion. A positive test is indicated if there is a sudden jerk as the arm is moved into horizontal flexion and as it is returned to the sta position. Posterior drawer test- The examiner passively displaces the huymeral head in a posterior direction. Pain, clicking, or an increase in humeral head translation indicates a positive test. Posterior apprehension test- The patient lies supine, with the shoulder flexed and internally rotated and with the elbow flexed and resting on the trunk. A posterior force is transmitted by the examiner through the subject's elbow. A look of apprehension and resistance to fuher movement constitutes a positive result. Push-pull test- The patient is positioned supine with the shoulder placed at a 90 degrees of scapular plane abduction. The examiner grasps the subject's wrist with one hand while the other hand is placed anteriorly near the humeral head. The examiner simultaneously pulls upward through the long axis of the forearm while pushing the humeral head posteriorly. A look of apprehension or displacement of the humeral head greater than 50% represents a postitive test. Circumduction test- The patient is in standing position. The examiner stands behind the patient grasping the patient's forearm with the hand. The examiner begins circumduction by extending the patient's arm while mainting slight abduction. As the circumduction continues into elevation, the arm is brought over the top and into the flexed and adducted postion. As the arm moves into forward flexion and adduction from above, it is vulnerable to posterior subluxation if the patient is unstable posteriorly. If the examiner palpates the posterior aspect of the patient's shoulder as the arm moves downward in forward flexion and adduction, the humeral head will be felt to subluxate posteriorly in a positive test. Jahnke test- A posteriorly directed force applied to the forward flexed shoulder. The shoulder is then moved into the coronal plane as an anterior directed force is applied to the humeral head. A clunk occurs as the humeral head reduces from the subluxed position. Tests for Inferior shoulder instability Sulcus sign- The patient stands with the arm by the side and shoulder muscles relaxed. The examiner grasps the patient's forearm below the elbow and pulls the arm distally. A positive test suggesting inferior instability of the shoulder is indicated if the patient's pain is reproduced and/or a sulcus appears distal to the acromian.",

These wounds require no dressing and are treated with topical salves to reduce pain. Oral NSAID, can be given for pain control. 2nd degree burn - Second degree wounds can be treated with daily dressing changes and topical antibiotics, cotton gauze, and elastic wraps. Alternatively the wounds can be treated with a temporary biologic or synthetic covering to close the wound. Deep 2nd degree & 3rd degree burns - Deep second degree and third degree burns are treated by excision and grafting. Initially dressing is used to check bacterial proliferation and provide occlusion until surgery is done. About option 'a' i. e. ' No bandage to head & neck' There are two methods of burn wound management with topical agents: 1) Open or exposure method - no dressings are applied over the wound after application of the topical agent to the wound 2) Closed method - an occlusive dressing is applied over the agent and is usually changed twice daily. The closed method is the preferred method except for places where it is difficult to apply the dressing material like - face & perineum. About option 'b' i. e. 'Immediate application of ice cold water'. Iced water should never be used, even on the smallest of burns. If ice or cold water is used on larger burns, systemic hypothermia often follows, and the associated cutaneous vasoconstriction can extend the thermal damage (Schwartz 8/e, p 192) Room temperature water can be poured on the wound within 15 minutes of injury to decrease the depth of the wound but any subsequent measures to cool the wound are avoided to prevent hypothermia during resuscitation (Sabiston 18/e, p 566)",

        "exp": "Treatment of rectal cancer: Surgical and oncological management varies greatly depending on the stage of the tumor within the rectum. Superficially invasive, small cancers may be managed effectively with local excision. However, most patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require major surgery, such as low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection. Low anterior resection: This is a sphincter saving procedure. In this procedure the sigmoid colon and proximal rectum are removed. The descending colon is anastomosed to the distal rectum. Previously this sphincter saving LAR procedure was possible for lesions confined in upper? rd of rectum. Lesions in lower third were treated with APR with permanent colostomy. With the introduction of stapling gun, the sphincter saving LAR operation can now be done even in lesions of lower? of rectum, provided a margin of 2 cm or more of normal bowel can be resected below the lesions but above the dentate line. 1 cm of margins can be adequate, provided the carcinoma is well differentiated. Abdominoperineal resection (also known as Miles procedure): In this procedure there is complete excision of the distal sigmoid colon, rectum and anus, by the concomitant dissection through the abdomen and perineum with creation of permanent colostomy. APR is performed when adequate distal margins for LAR cannot be obtained i. e. for carcinoma in lower rectum. Local excision: In carefully selected patients with small, well differentiated, superficial, mobile polypoid lesions, a full thickness excision can be performed through the transrectal route as the definitive therapy. Local excision can be done for selected T1 and T2 lesions without evidence of nodal disease. Palliative procedures: unresectable rectal cancers can be palliated by fulguration (electrocoagulation) or laser photocoagulation. Chemoradiation: Chemoradiation can be given as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. \"In this patient the tumor lies 3. 5 cms above the anal verge (the lower limit is taken into consideration). Dentate line is just 2 cms from the anl verge so the tumor is just 1. 5 cm from the dentate line. A minimum margin of 2 cm is required below the tumor for sphincter saving LAR, so the patient will have to go an APR procedure to remove the tumor\".

        "question": "True statement about burn resuscitation?",
        "exp": "Ans is 'c' i. e. Half of the calculated fluid given in initial 8 hrs Proper fluid management is critical to survival in a burn patient. The hypovolemic shock in burn patient is special in the sense that the total body water remains unchanged in a burn patient. The thermal injury leads to a massive fluid shift from intravascular compament to the extravascular compament (interstitial + intracellular) leading to edema formation (in both burned pas and non burned pas of body) This fluid shift is maximum in the first 24 hrs. Fluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution - Ringer's lactate solution (RL) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extravascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume. - The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i. e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas) - half of the calculated fluid is given in first 8 hrs and half in next 16 hrs. Colloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capillaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning) A number of parameters are widely used to assess burn resuscitation, but the most common remain the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patient, the target MAP is 60 mm. Hg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1. 5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients. * There is no use of diuretics in burn resuscitation. Children under 20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",

Emotional factors: Anxiety, stress and strain Liver disease: Ulceration of both stomach and duodenum have co-existed with disease of the liver paicularly cirrhosis.

There are three main types of Rhabdomyosarcoma; Embryonal, Pleomorphic and Alveolar. 1. Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma (Sarcoma botryoides) Usually arises in the orbit or genitourinary tract in children. The botryoid type of Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma, which frequently originates in mucosa-lined visceral organs such as the vagina and the urinary bladder, generally grows as a polypoid tumor. These tumors may disseminate widely, but are responsive to chemotherapy and radiation. Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma occasionally arise in adults. Although regression of tumor in response to pediatric chemotherapy regimens usually occurs, age is an impoant prognostic factor for survival, with worse outcomes in older patients. 2. Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma Extremity Rhabdomyosarcoma in adolescents and young adults often has an alveolar histology. Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma is composed of ill-defined aggregates of poorly differentiated round or oval cells that frequently show central loss of cellular cohesion and formation of irregular alveolar spaces. These tumors appear to have a worse prognosis than Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma in younger children, but not in adults. A specific translocation, t (2, 13) (q37; q14) involving the PAX3 gene on chromosome 2 and the FKHR gene on chromosome 13, is seen in the majority of alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma. 3.

Schwaz writes- \"The overall objectives are to increase the probability of spontaneous closure. Most surgeons would pursue 2 to 3 months of conservative therapy before considering surgical intervention. This approach is based on evidence that 90% of fistulas that are going to close, close within a 5-week interval, and also that surgical interventions after this time period are associated with better outcomes and lower morbidity. If the fistula fails to resolve during this period, surgery may be required during which the fistula tract, together with the segment of intestine from which it originates, should be resected. \" Conservative management consists of Fluid and electrolyte resuscitation Nutrition, usually through TPN; TPN allows bowel to rest Control of sepsis with antibiotics and drainage of abscesses Treatment with 1-12 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors or Somatostatin analogues (Octreotide) decreases fistula output. Factors inhibiting spontaneous closure: Malnutrition Foreign body within the fistula tract Radiation enteritis Malignant fistula Inflammatory bowel disease Local inflammation and sepsis High output fistula Sho fistulous tract (<2 cm) Epithelialization of the fistula tract Distal obstruction of the intestine Fistulas can be divided into 3 types according to 'output' - low output (<200 mL/24 hr), - moderate output (200-500 mL/24 hr), and high output (>500 mL/24 hr).",

Ve p 52, 1952] Angioedema is essentially an anaphylaxis limited to the skin and subcutaneous tissues and can be due to drug allergy, insect stings or bites, desensitization injections or ingestion of ceain foods (paicularly eggs, shellfish or nuts) Sometimes reactions occur explosively after ingestion of minute amounts. Others (e. g. reactions to strawberries), may occur only after overindulgence and possibly result from direct (toxic) mediator liberation. It is characterized by a diffuse and painful swelling of loose subcutaneous tissue, e. g. dorsum of hands or feet, eyelids, lips, genitalia and mucous membrane. Edema of the upper airways may produce respiratory distress and the stridor may be mistaken for asthma. Treatment Epinephrine should be the first treatment for acute pharyngeal or laryngeal angioedema. This may be supplemented, by a nebulized agonist (e. g. albuterol) and an I. V. antihistamine (diphenhydramine). This is usually sufficient to prevent airway obstruction hut intubating or performing a tracheostomy and administering 0, might be necessary. Also know Uicaria This is also an anaphylaxis reaction, but in uicarias the disease is limited to the superficial tissues. Uicaria is characterized by local wheals and erythema in the superficial dermis whereas angioedema is a deeper swelling due to edematous areas in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Generally, pruritus is the first symptom, which is followed sholy by the appearance of wheals that may remain small (1-5 mm) or enlarge. The larger ones tend to be clear in the centre and may be noticed, first as large rings (> 20 cm across) of erythema and edema. Also know If acute angioedema is recurrent progressive, painful rather than pruritic and not associated with uicaria a hereditary enzyme deficiency should be considerd. Hereditary angioneurotic edema occurs due to loss of C1 inhibitor (regulatory protein) CIF of hereditary angioneuroedema - Episodes of laryngeal edema - Prominence of recurrent gastrointestinal attacks - lack of pruritus and of uicarial lesions Laboratory diagnosis of hereditary angioneuroedema - It depends upon demonstrating the deficiency of C1 inhibitor",

        "exp": "More than 90% of full term newborn infants pass meconium within the first 24 hrs. The possibility of intestinal obstruction is considered if an infant does not pass meconium for 24-36 hrs. Differential diagnosis would include causes of low intestinal obstruction. - Hirschsprung disease - Beal or colonic atresia/stenosis - Meconium ileus - Meconium plug syndrome - Neonatal small left colon syndrome The first investigation is always a plain abdominal radiograph (supine and left lateral decubitus view) Next investigation is a contrast enema also k/a lower GI series (presence of any perforation can be ruled out from plain X-rays) Barium can be used but water-soluble contrast agents are used commonly Contrast enema helps to some extent in differentiating among the causes of low intestinal obstructions. Hirschsprung's disease- Barium enema usually shows a transition zone between dilated proximal colon and a smaller-caliber obstructed distal colon caused by the nonrelaxation of the agaglionic bowel. However, a normal study does not exclude Hirschsprung's disease. Diagnosis is confirmed by rectal biopsy. Meconium ilens- Meconium ileus occurs when meconium becomes inspissated and obstructs the distal ileum. The condition is usually a manifestation of cystic fibrosis. Meconium ileus is usually taken to be synonymous with cystic fibrosis until proven otherwise, and meconium ileus is generally the earliest manifestation of the disease. Contrast enema study typically demonstrates microcolon, which is a reflection of underused bowel. Meconium plug syndrome Meconium plug syndrome, also termed functional immaturity of the colon, is a transient disorder of the newborn colon characterized by delayed passage (>24-48 h) of meconium and intestinal dilatation. Currently, meconium plug syndrome is understood as a transient functional disorder of the colon resulting from immaturity of the myenteric plexus nerve cells or their hormonal receptors. Contrast enema demonstrates the retained meconium as a filling defect or plug that produces a double-contrast effect. Usually, the colon is normal or may be mildly enlarged and filled with meconium. A change in the colon's diameter at the splenic flexure may be seen and is indistinguishable from that observed in Hirschsprung disease, although in the latter disorder the transition zone usually is in the rectosigmoid. Meconium plug syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion. Contrast enema usually eliminates congenital small bowel obstruction and rare colon abnormalities such as atresia or duplication. The primary differential consideration is Hirschsprung disease, which is diagnosed eventually in approximately 10-30% of patients with apparent meconium plug syndrome Neonatal small left colon syndrome - Colonic obstruction with a characteristic caliber reduction in the sigmoid and descending colon unrelated to meconium inspissation or aganglionosis. This condition has a frequent association with maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and seldom requires surgical intervention. A contrast enema demonstrated a narrowed descending and sigmoid colon, with a caliber transition at the splenic flexure.",

(c. f. in pyogenic abscess jaundice is seen in -. 25% of pts.) Liver function tests may show mild abnormalities, hyperbilirubinemia is uncommon. CT > U/S are the mainstay of investigation. Diagnosis is confirmed by serological tests (enzyme immuno assay) for antiamoebic antibodies. Cultures of amoebic abscess are usually negative. Treatment Metronidazole is the mainstay of t/t and is curative in over 90% of patients. (other nitroimidazoles i. e. secnidazole, tinidazole, are also effective) Therapeutic needle aspiration is avoided.

It is a gangrenous process of the mouth, which stas suddenly, rapidly involve the adjacent tissues of the face, quickly becomes well demarcated, and then spreads no fuher. It most often affects one or both sides of the jaw, and occasionally the front of the face (mouth, lips, nose & chin). The gangrenous process may spread to destroy the bones of the face. This disease occurs primarily in severely malnourished child less than 5 yrs of age. Often they have had a preceeding illness such as measels, malaria, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, malignancy or immunodeficiency, which has weakened the general health of the child. The exact cause is not known, but may be bacterial. Fusiformis & Borrelia are largely responsible, but the ds. is not contigious. Untreated cancrum oris is almost always quickly fatal, due to associated illness or a complication, such as septicemia or aspiration pneumonia. Management involves a) correction of general condition b) antibiotics (Penicillin + Metronidazole) c) Excision of the dead tissue d) Plastic surgery Coming to the question, the best choice is option 'b' i. e. follows chronic infection, as the ds. not always follows an infection.

        "question": "All are true about Flail chest, except:",
        "exp": "Ans is 'd' i. e. Paradoxical movement may not be seen in conscious patients Flail chest is simply when a poion of the bony chest wall loses its continuity from the remainder of the thorax due to multiple fractures. By definition, a flail chest occurs in the presence of two or more fractures in three or more consecutive ribs (either on one side of the chest or either side of the sternum) and causes instability of the chest wall: however, it can also occur after costochondral separation. Flail chest is characterized by paradoxical motion of the chest wall (inward with inspiration and outward with expiration). The chance of having an intrathoracic injury in this situation increases severalfold. The paradoxical motion increases the work of breathing, and the most impoant consequence of flail chest is respiratory failure. Until recently it was believed that ineffective air movement between both lungs caused by paradoxical motion of the chest wall was the main cause of the respiratory distress in patients with flail chest. It is now understood that underlying pulmonary contusion and pain during inspiration are the most impoant components in the pathophysiology of the respiratory failure. Management: Patients without evidence of respiratory distress can be managed with only analgesia. Pain control can be provided by an intercostal nerve block or more adequately by epidural anesthesia. If respiratory distress develops, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with peak end-expiratory pressure are usually indicated, provided that pain control is adequate. - Sequential aerial blood gas determination may gauge the severity of an injury and is useful to predict which patients will require ventilatory suppo. The ratio of aerial oxygen tension to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Pa02: Fi02 ratio) yields an estimate of the extent of intrapulmonary shunt and may be used as a parameter to determine the need for mechanical ventilation. - Schwaz 7/e p689 writes-\"1ntubation is delayed until clear evidence of a need of ventilator suppo develops: a respiratory rate of 40/min, a falling Pa. CO2 (evidence of excessive work of breathing) or a Pa02 below 60 Corr on inspired 02 fraction of over 0. 5\" - General Thoracic Surgery By Thomas W.

IMA \"Occlusion of the inferior mesenteric aery does not always result in irreversible ischaemia of the descending and sigmoid colon, because the marginal aery of the colon usually receives an adequate supply from the left branch of the middle colic aery. Moreover, the sigmoid aeries may be supplied by the superior rectal aery, which anastomoses with the middle and inferior rectal aeries. When ischaemia does occur, it is usually maximal in the proximal descending colon because this region is fuhest from the collateral aerial supplies. \"- Gray's Anatomy The colon is supplied by SMA and IMA which have extensive collateral circulation in the form of marginal aery and arc of Riolan The Marginal Aery of Drummond connects SMA and IMA, and forms a continuous arcade along the mesenteric border of the colon. The Arc of Riolan, also known as the Meandering Mesenteric aery, is another vascular arcade present in the colonic mesentery that connect the proximal Middle Colic aery (branch of SMA) with the proximal Left colic aery (branch of IMA). These collateral circulation in the form of Marginal aery and Arc of Riolan are able to sustain the pa of left colon in case of occlusion of the IMA. Moreever a distal collateral circulation also exists between the superior rectal aery (a branch of IMA) and the middle and inferior rectal aery (branches of the internal iliac aery). Celiac trunk and SMA do not have such rich collateral circulation and supply much more impoant pas than colon. Renal aery is an end aery, does not have any collaterals, so any injury or complete occlusion would lead to loss of the kidney.",

Iritis, uveitis, and nondeforming ahritis may also occur. The 50-year-old drug abuser also has a multisystem disease, including systemic complaints, hypertension, skin lesions, neuropathy, and an abnormal urine sediment. This complex suggests a vasculitis, paicularly polyaeritis nodosa. The disease is a necrotizing vasculitis of small and medium muscular aeries. The pathology of the kidney includes an aeritis and, in some cases, a glomerulitis. Nodular skin lesions show vasculitis on biopsy. The 19-year-old with low back pain, morning stiffness, and eye pain has complaints that suggest ankylosing spondylitis. This is an inflammatory disorder that affects the axial skeleton. It is an autoimmune disorder that has a close association with HLA-B27 histocompatibility antigen. Anterior uveitis is the most common extraaicular complaint. Aoic regurgitation occurs in a few percent of patients. The elderly male presents with nonspecific joint complaints typical of polymyalgia rheumatica.

There is evidence suggesting that cigarette smoking may play a role in increasing the risk of colorectal and possibly premenopausal breast cancer, but there is no association with postmenopausal breast cancer. There does not appear to be a causal link between cigarette smoking and cancer of the endometrium, and there is a lower risk of uterine cancer among postmenopausal women who smoke. \" Thus the answer should be none, however Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is found to be least associated with smoking. Head & Neck Cancers by Enslow Jacobs 2003e p492 writes-\"Association between smoking and nasopharyngeal carcinoma has been shown only by a few studies.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common true arterial aneurysm. An aortic aneurysm is defined as a focal dilation of the aorta with a diameter of at least 1. 5 times that of the expected normal diameter of that given aortic segment; in the AA, enlargement of the aortic diameter of more than 3 cm is usually considered aneurysmal. A most common site is infrarenal. More common in males than females. Incidence increases with age. At least 90% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms >4. 0 cm are related to atherosclerotic disease. Prognosis is related to both the size of an aneurysm and the severity of coexisting coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease. The risk of rupture is directly related to the size of an aneurysm. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually asymptomatic. They are usually detected incidentally on routine clinical examinations or investigation performed for some other reasons. As abdominal aortic aneurysms expand, however, they may become painful. Aneurysmal pain is usually a harbinger of rupture and represents a medical emergency. More often, acute rupture occurs without any prior warning, and this complication is always life-threatening. Contrast-enhanced CT is an investigation of choice. MRI is as sensitive and specific as CECT and is used if the use of contrast is precluded. Ultrasound is the screening study of choice and is useful for serial documentation of aneurysm size Operative repair of an aneurysm with the insertion of a prosthetic graft or endovascular placement of an aortic stent graft is indicated for: abdominal aortic aneurysms of any size that are expanding rapidly or are associated with symptoms. for asymptomatic aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is indicated if the diameter is >5. 5 cm. The decision to perform an open surgical operation or endovascular repair is based in part on the vascular anatomy and comorbid conditions. Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms has a lower short-term morbidity rate but a comparable long-term mortality rate with open surgical reconstruction. (Harrison 18/e) In Elective surgery of abdominal aortic aneurysm the operative mortality, rate approximates 1 to 2% whereas after acute rupture the mortality rate of emergency operation generally exceeds 50%.",

Timely passage of the first stool is a hallmark of the well-being of the newborn infant. 99% of term infants and 95% of premature infants pass meconium within 48 hrs of bih - Nelson 17/e p527. Failure of a full-term newborn to pass meconium within the first 24 hours should raise a suspicion of intestinal obstruction. It's usually a lower GI obstruction. In many cases of suspected neonatal intestinal obstruction, the clinical history and physical examination combined with plain abdominal radiographs, contrast enema radiographic examination, anorectal manometry and rectal biopsy eventually yield the diagnosis. Anal inspection is essential to exclude the presence of anal atresia, perinea] fistula with anal atresia and anal stenosis. In Hirschprung's disease barium enema radiographic examination, performed with the colon unprepared, may reveal a transition zone that separates the small- to normal-diameter aganglionic bowel from the dilated bowel above Meconium plug syndrome is the mildest and most common form of functional distal obstruction in the newborn. It is a transient form of distal colonic or rectal obstruction caused by inspissated, immobile meconium. Contrast enema is diagnostic, showing the outline of the meconium plug. In meconium ileus, low or distal intestinal obstruction results from the impaction of thick, tenacious meconium in the distal small bowel. Cystic fibrosis is the underlying disorder in most infants with meconium ileus. Contrast enema radiographic examination demonstrates a microcolon, often with no bowel contents. Reflux of contrast into the small bowel reveals the plugs. The small bowel is of narrow caliber below the plug and dilated above the plug. Small left colon syndrome is a condition with a characteristic caliber reduction in the sigmoid and descending colon unrelated to meconium inspissation or aganglionosis. Contrast studies show the colon to be shoened and to lack the usual touosity from the anus to the splenic flexure. A sharp transition zone is seen at the splenic flexure Other conditions associated with delayed passage of meconium are: Various maternal medical conditions can cause a delay in meconium passage. In addition, maternal drug use, such as illicit drugs, magnesium sulfate and ganglionic blocking agents, can affect the infant and interfere with the passage of meconium. Neonatal medical conditions that can be associated with a failure to pass meconium include - hypothyroidism, - hypercalcemia, - hypokalemia, - sepsis and - congestive heart failure.",

If the bony connection between the inferior and superior aiculating facets (pars interaicularis) is defective, the weight of the body may cause the upper veebra, including all of the veebral bodies above it, to slip forward for varying amounts on the body below (spondylolisthesis) The defect in the pars interaicularis is called spondylolysis Spondylolysis is not present at bih but increases in frequency with increasing age. When symptomatic, pain is the most frequent symptom of either spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis There are several different etiologies for spondylolisthesis: Spondylolytic spondylolisthesis is the most common type and results from bilateral defects in the pars interaicularis. Degenerative spondylolisthesis -Most frequent at the L4-L5 level It is not the result of a pars defect but a complex interaction between the disk, facets joints and the ligamentous structures Dysplastic spondylolisthesis-Results from congenital abnormalities of the body and/or facets in the lumbar region such that the alignment of the facets allows spondylolisthesis to occur. The pars may or may not be intact Traumatic spondylolisthesis-Trauma can lead to an acute fracture through a normal pars interaicularis. Conventional radiography in the anteroposterior, lateral and both oblique projections is usually adequate to demonstrate both spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis Spondylolysis appears as a break in the \"neck\" of the Scottie Dog on the oblique view",

        "exp": "Achalasia cardia is motor disorder of the esophageal smooth muscle in which the LES does not relax normally with swallowing, and esophageal body undergoes nonspecific contractions. (peristalsis is absent or reduced). The pathogenesis of achalasia is poorly understood. It involves: Neurologic degeneration either idiopathic or due to infection. The degenerative changes are either intrinsic (degeneration of ganglion cells of auerbach's myenteric plexus) or extrinsic (extraesophageal vagus nerve or the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve) Pharmacological studies suggest dysfunction of inhibitory neurons containing nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the distal esophagus. The cholinergic innervation of the LES is intact or affected only in advance disease. As a result of the abnormality, the LES fails to relax, primary peristalsis is absent in esophagus which dilates. As the disease progresses the esophagus becomes massively dilated and touous. Clinical Presentation: Both sexes are equally affected. It may develop at any age but peak years are from 30 to 60 years of age. Classical clinical symptom is progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Dysphagia is worsened by emotional stress and hurried eating. Diagnosis: Chest X-ray shows absence of gastric air bubbles, an air fluid level in the mediastinum in the upright position representing retained food in the esophagus. Barium swallow shows a dilated esophagus with tapering narrowing in the terminal end of esophagus, described as 'BIRD BEAK' appearance. Fluoroscopy shows loss of normal peristalsis in the lower third of the esophagus. Treatment includes heller's cardiomyotomy, forceful dilation by pneumatic balloon, repeated injection botulinum toxins and drugs improving motility of esophagus. Esophagectomy is not a treatment modality for achalasia cardia. Irregular filling defect is a feature of carcinoma esophagus not of achalasia cardia.

Patients tend to be hypotensive and ohostatic, about 90% have systolic blood pressure under 110 mm Hg. Diastolic blood pressure is also decreased, the B. P. is usually in the range of 80/50 or less. In addison's diseases the heart is usually smallQ. In addison's disease the plasma renin activity is usually elevated, - It indicates the presence of depleted intravascular volume. Addison's disease The predominant manifestations in Addison's disease occur due to mineralocoicoid deficiency but the symptoms are also contributed by glucocoicoid deficiency and increased ACTH FEATURES OF:- Mineralocoicoid deficiency lack of aldosterone secretion greatly decreases renal tubular sodium reabsorption and consequently allows sodium ions, chloride ions and water to be lost into urine in great profusion. The net result is greatly decreased extracellular fluid volume. Fuhermore, hyponatremia2, hyperkalemia0 and mild acidosis0 develop because of failure of potassium and hydrogen ions to be secreted in exchange for sodium reabsorption. Glucocoicoid deficiency Loss of coisol secretion leads to hypoglycaemia because of decreased gluconeogenesis and increased peripheral utilization of glucose. Fuhermore, lack of coisol reduces0 the mobilization of both proteins and fats from the tissues thereby depressing many other metabolic functions of the body. This sluggishness of energy mobilization when coisol is not available is one of the major detrimental effects of glucocoicoid lack. Increased ACTH When coisol secretion is depressed the normal negative feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland is also depressed, therefore allowing tremendous rates of ACTH secretion as well as simultaneous secretion of increased amount of MSH. Probably the tremendous amount of ACTH cause most of the pigmenting effect because they can stimulate formation of melanin by the melanocytes in the same way that MSH does. REMEMBER The clinical features and laboratory features described above are characteristically seen only in primary addison's disease because in primary addison's disease both aldosterone and glucocoicoid are deficient, whereas In secondary addison's disease only glucocoicoid deficiency is seen. \" ALSO KNOW The basis for acute adrenal deficiency or addisonian crisis During conditions of physical or mental stress, large amount of glucocoicoids are secreted to cope up with the situation. But in persons with addison's disease, the output of glucocoicoids does not increase during stress. Thus the deficiency of glucocoicoids, when a person actually has acute need for the excessive amount of glucocoicoids produces addisonian crisis. The manifestations are produced due to extracellular fluid dehydration and low blood volume leading to circulatory shock.",

Pseudocysts are connected with the pancreatic duct system either as a direct communication or indirectly the pancreatic parenchyma. They are caused by pancreatic ductal disruption following increased pancreatic ductal pressure either due to stenosis, calculi or protein plugs obstructing the main pancreatic ductal system or as a result of pancreatic necrosis following an attack of acute pancreatitis. Complications of pseudocysts in chronic pancreatitis are: Rupture into the gastrointestinal tract either results in no symptoms or leads to melaena or haematemesis that usually requires urgent conservative measures. Rupture into the general peritoneal cavity results in features of peritonitis and on occasions an associated haemorrhagic shock. Haemorrhage can greatly complicate the course of a pseudocyst. Interventional radiology can play an invaluable role both in locating the source of bleeding and in embolisation of the bleeding vessel. Infection occurs either spontaneously or after therapeutic or diagnostic manipulations. Biliary complications occur due to a large cyst in the pancreatic head region obstructing the common bile duct and resulting in obstructive jaundice. Poal hypertension can result from compression or obstruction of the splenic vein/ poal vein either by the cyst alone or in conjunction with underlying chronic pancreatitis.",

D: 3 The Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS, also known as the Glasgow Coma Score is a neurological scale which aims to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person, for initial as well as continuing assessment. The scale comprises three tests: eye, verbal and motor responses. The three values separately as well as their sum are considered. The lowest possible GCS is 3 (deep coma or death), while the highest is 15 (fully awake person). Best eye response (E) There are 4 grades staing with the most severe: - No eye opening Eye opening in response to pain. (Patient responds to pressure on the patient's fingernail bed; if this does not elicit a response, supraorbital and sternal pressure or rub may be used.) - Eye opening to speech. (Not to be confused with an awaking of a sleeping person; such patients receive a score of 4, not 3.) - Eyes opening spontaneously Best verbal response (V) There are 5 grades staing with the most severe: - No verbal response - Incomprehensible sounds. (Moaning but no words.) Inappropriate words. (Random or exclamatory aiculated speech, but no conversational exchange) - Confused. (The patient responds to questions coherently but there is some disorientation and confusion.) - Oriented. (Patient responds coherently and appropriately to questions such as the patient's name and age, where they are and why, the year, month, etc.) Best motor response (M) There are 6 grades staing with the most severe: - No motor response - Extension to pain (adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm, extension of wrist, decerebrate response) Abnormal flexion to pain (adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm, flexion of wrist, decoicate response) - Flexion/ Withdrawal to pain (flexion of elbow, supination of forearm, flexion of wrist when supra-orbital pressure applied; pulls pa of body away when nailbed pinched) - Localizes to pain.

        "question": "A 68 yr old man came with pain and swelling of right knee. Ahlback grade 2 osteoahritic changes were found on investigation. What is the fuher management?",
        "exp": "Conservative [Ref: Campbell Operative Ohopaedics 11/e, p 916; Apley's Ohopaedics 9/e, p 572573; Turek's Ohopedics 6/e, p 616-621; Imaging of the knee: Techniques & application by A. Mark Davies et al 2003, p 12; Harrison 17/e, p 2163-21651 Initial management of most of the patients of knee OA is conservative or non-operative. Campbell operative ohopaedics writes? \"Osteoahritis of the knee can cause symptoms ranging from mild to disabiling. Initial management of most patients should be nonoperative\". Surgical management is needed when the conservative management fails. Surgical management in brief: The choice of surgical procedure depends on the patient's age and activity demand, severity of the disease and the number of knee compaments involved. Ahroscopic washout or debridement: - It consists of trimming of degenerate meniscal tissue and osteophytes - It may delay the need for a more definitive procedure, especially in younger, active patients with localised degenerative ahritis that causes pain at rest without malalignment or instability - It may also be considered in active, older adults with mild to moderate OA Realignment osteotomy: High or proximal tibial osteotomy (HTO)? High tibial osteotomy is a procedure for the treatment of unicompamental osteoahritis of the knee (medial or lateral compament osteoahritis; usually it is medial; lateral compament osteoahritis is uncommon). Medial osteoahritis is associated with varus deformity of the knee. Varus deformity causes stresses to be concentrated medially, accelerating degenerative changes in the medial pa of the joint (similarly if the deformity is of valgus position, changes are accelerated in the lateral pa). The biomechanical rationale for proximal tibial osteotomy in patients with unicompamental osteoahritis of the knee is \"unloading\" of the involved joint compament by correcting the malalignment and redistributing the stresses on the knee joint. Thus medial osteoahritis is treated by a varus correcting osteotomy (k/a valgus osteotomy) and the uncommon lateral osteoahritis corrected by valugus correcting osteotomy (k/a varus osteotomy). According to Ebnezar (3/e p547) High tibial osteotomy is done for varus deformity less than 15deg and valgus deformity less than 12deg. Supracondylar or distal femoral osteotomy? - distal femoral osteotomy is done for correction of valgus deformity more than 12 to 15deg (Ref Campbell's Ohopaedics 1/e chapter 25) Total knee ahroplasty: - It is done for older patients with advanced OA that causes incapacitating pain and disability or young patients with tricompamental (medial and lateral tibio femoral and patellofemoral) disease. But it should be delayed in young patients as long as possible as prostheses may wear out over time and may need fuher revision surgery. Unicompamental ahroplasty: - In carefully selected patients with either medial or lateral osteoahritis, it is becoming a ble alternative to TKA and HTO. Knee ahrodesis: - Ahrodesis is indicated less commonly than ahroplasty. If the patient is young and involved in heavy occupation, ahrodesis is indicated to give him a stable and strong knee. - This procedure provides permanent pain relief and allows the patient to return to durable, active work. However ahrodesis results in a stiff knee which is a severe disability. Ahlback's grading of osteoahritis Ahlback's grading is radiological grading of osteoahritis. Standard textbooks of Ohopaedics (Campbell, Turek, Apley's) and of Radiology (Grainger, Sutton, Greenspan's Ohopedic Imaging) do not mention anything about it. Treatment of osteoahritis depends on symptoms and clinical profile of pt and not on radiological grading. Still we are describing the grading below. Grading of osteoahritis Apa from Ahlback grading, other commonly used grading system is by Kellgren and Lawrence. The two grading system are compared as follows: Classification of knee OA Ahlback Kellgren and Lawrence Grade Definition Grade Definition Grade 1 \"doubtful\" Minute osteophytes doubtful significant Grade 2 \"minimal\" Definite osteophytes (unimpaired air space) Grade 1 Joint space narrowing (< 3 mm) Grade 3 \"moderate\" Moderate diminution of joint spaces Grade 2 Joint space obliferation Grade 4 \" severe \" Joint space great impaired with sclerosis of subchondral bone Grade 3 Minor bone attrition (0-5 mm) Grade 4 Same as above Grade 4 Moderate bone attrition (5-10 mm) Grade 4 As above Grade 5 Severe bone attrition (> 10 mm) Grade 4 As above Note- Grade I of Ahlback is equivalent to grade 3 of Kellgren and Lawrence& grade 2, 3, 4&5 of Ahlback is equivalent to grade 4 of Kellgren and Lawrence. It must be noted that the radiological grading may not correlate with clinical symptomology of the patients. The treatment is based on the symptoms of patient (and not merely on radiographic appearances)",

The basic abnormality in Ehler's Danlos syndrome (EDS) is some defect in the synthesis or structure of collagen Biosynthesis of collagen is a complex process It involves numerous structural collagen genes or enzymes. Which are used in post transcriptional modification of collagen. Therefore it can be disturbed by no. of genetic errors that may affect any of the numerous genes or enzymes necessary for collagen synthesis. At the molecular level, a variety of defects, varying. from mutations involving structural genes or collagens to those involving enzymes that are responsible for post transcriptional modification of m. RNA have been detected. Such molecular heterogenecity result in expression of EDS as a clinically variable disorder with several patterns of inheritance. On the basis of clinical and molecular characteristics six variants of Ehler's Danlos syndrome have been identified. The common thread in all forms of EDS is some abnormality in the synthesis of collagen. Clinical features - As might be expected tissues rich in collagen such as skin, ligaments and joints are frequently involved. - Because the abnormal collagen fibre lacks adequate tensile strength, skin is hyper extensible and the joints are hypermobile. The skin is extraordinarily stretchaeble, extremely fragile and vulnerable to trauma. - Minor injuries produce gaping defects and surgical repair or intervention is accomplished with great difficulty because of the lack of normal tensile strength. - The defect in connective tissue may lead to serious internal complications which include:? - Rupture of the colon and large aeries - Occular. fragility with rupture of cornea and retinal detachment - Diaphragmatic hernia EQS type Gene defect Inheritance Clinical findings Classical Defect in type V collagen Mutation in COL5A gene Autosomal dominant Skin and joint hypermo? bility, atrophic scars, Easy bruising Hypermobility Unknow Autosomal dominant Joint hypennobility, pain, dislocations Vascular Defect in collagen type 111 Autosomal The skin, aerial or Collagen ill is abundant in Blood vessels and intestine ( *.. severe defect of these organs dominants uterine rupture, bru? ising, small joint hyperextensibility Kyphoscoliosis Reduced level of lysyl hydroxylase essential for cross linking of collagen fibres Autosomal recessive Hypotonia, joint laxity, congenital scoliosis, ocular fragility Ahrochalasia - Defect in conversion of Autosomal Severe joint hypenno?

Autosomal Recessive Severe skin fragility, cutis laxa, bruising Cutis laxa The inelastic hyperextensible skin fails to resume its normal shape after stretching and hence appears pendulous. Therefore affected newborn infants appear \"prematurely aged\". The skin abnormality is most prominent around eye, face neck. Therefore patients with cutis laxa have characteristic facial features including an aged appearance with sagging jaws (blood hound appearance) a hooked nose with eveed nostrils, a sho columella, a long upper lip and eveed lower eyelids. Hypermobility of the joint is not present. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum It is a rare group of disorders affecting the elastic tissue. It primarily affects the dermis, retina, and cardiovascular system.

        "exp": "Calcium restriction Calcium intake in stone Higher urine calcium is a common finding in stone formers, but restricting dietary calcium intake is not recommended unless it is excessive (more than 2000 mg/d). Although urine calcium excretion may decrease with restriction, the decrease in free intestinal calcium can lead to increased absorption of dietary oxalate and enhanced oxalate excretion, due to decreased binding of oxalate by calcium in the intestinal lumen. The net effect may be increased supersaturation of the urine with respect to calcium oxalate and an enhanced tendency to stone formation. Prevention of recurrent calcium stones (which are usually composed primarily of calcium oxalate) is aimed at decreasing the concentrations of the lithogenic factors (calcium and oxalate) and at increasing the concentrations of inhibitors of stone formation, such as citrate. - Achieving these goals may require both dietary modification and the administration of appropriate medications. Medical therapy (and metabolic evaluation) is usually undeaken in individuals who have formed more than one stone. Reduce animal protein intake Adverse changes in urinary calcium and citrate excretion can be induced by a high protein diet, since the metabolism of sulfur- containing amino acids increases the daily acid load by generating sulfuric acid. Animal protein is much more likely to induce this effect than vegetable protein, since it has a higher sulfur content and therefore generates more acid. Thus, lowering animal protein intake will produce, orable changes in the urine. However, it has not been proven that this will reduce the incidence of stone. formation. In observational studies, a high animal protein diet was a risk factor. for renal stones in men, but not in women. In a randomized trial, reduced animal protein in association with higher dietary calcium and lower dietary sodium was associated with a reduced risk of stone recurrence, but the individual impact of animal protein could not be determined. Based on the available data, it would be prudent to avoid excessive animal protein intake. Increase fruit and vegetable intake Foods that are rich in potassium, paicularly fruits and vegetables, may be beneficial. Increasing intake of fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation, paicularly in patients who self-select a diet that is low in fruits and vegetables. This benefit is primarily the result of increasing citrate excretion. Limit dietary oxalate intake Some. foods contain very large amounts of oxalate and those should be avoided (eg spinach, rhubarb). In addition, some nuts and legumes are also high in oxalate and the intake should be limited (eg, peanuts, cashews, and almonds). However, there is scant evidence that low oxalate diets reduce the risk of stone formation. In prospective observational studies of individuals who had never had a stone, higher dietary oxalate only slightly increased the risk of incident stone formation in men and older women; there was no association in younger women. Because of the documented health benefits of many. foods that are traditionally considered high in oxalate (but still 10 mg or less per serving), strict oxalate restriction does not seem to be suppoed. As noted above, some foods traditionally believed to be high in oxalate, such as tea, do not increase the risk of stone formation. If a low oxalate diet is recommended, it should only be continued if there is documented evidence that the urine oxalate excretion has fallen. Limit sodium intake Calcium is reabsorbed passively in the proximal tubule down the. orable concentration gradient created by the reabsorption of sodium and water. Thus, a low sodium diet (to 80 to 100 meq/day) can enhance proximal sodium and calcium reabsorption, leading to a reduction in calcium excretion. In one study, for example, lowering sodium intake from 200 to 80 meq/day diminished calcium excretion by as much as 100 mg/day (2. 5 mmol/day). Although the independent contribution of lowering dietary sodium intake on actual stone formation is unknown and higher sodium intake may be associated with higher urine volume, it is likely an impoant component of a regimen that has been demonstrated to reduce recurrent stone. formation. Limit sucrose and fructose intake Sucrose intake increases urine calcium independent of calcium intake and has been associated with an increased risk of stones. Fructose intake also increases the risk of stone. formation. Calcium intake Higher urine calcium is a common finding in stone forrners, but restricting dietary calcium intake is not recommended unless it is excessive (more than 2000 rued). Although urine calcium excretion may decrease with restriction, the decrease in. free intestinal calcium can lead to increased absorption of dietary oxalate and enhanced oxalate excretion, due to decreased binding of oxalate by calcium in the intestinal lumen. The net effect may be increased supersaturation of the urine with respect to calcium oxalate and an enhanced tendency to stone. formation. The ability to help prevent new stone formation with a normal calcium intake was shown in pa by a five year study that compared two diets among men with idiopathic hypercalciuria and recurrent calcium oxalate stones. - In this trial, 120 such men were randomly assigned to either a diet consisting of a normal amount of calcium (1200 mg/day ) and low amounts of animal protein (52 g/day) and salt (2900 mg/day of sodium chloride) or a diet containing a low amount of calcium (400 mg/day ). At. five years, a significantly lower risk of stone recurrence was observed among the group assigned to the normal calcium, low animal-protein, low-salt diet. - This selective benefit likely arose because of a decrease in urinary oxalate excretion compared to an increase with the low calcium diet; the urine calcium actually decreased in both treatment arms. However, the independent effect of calcium is unclear given that the amounts of animal protein and salt ingested among those in the low calcium diet differed from that of patients in the normal calcium diet group. Nonetheless, the low calcium intervention was not beneficial and is not recommended. -In addition to increasing stone formation, a low calcium diet may have a second deleterious effect in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria: development of negative calcium balance. This extra loss of calcium can exacerbate the already diminished hone density in some of these patients, a complication that may be due to enhanced bone resorption. It should be noted that calcium supplements do not appear to be effective in preventing recurrent stones and may even slightly increase risk. - Ira patients with a history of stones who require calcium supplements (eg,. for the treatment of osteoporosis), a suggested approach is to measure urinary calcium excretion before and approximately one month after staing the calcium supplement. If there is a clinically impoant increase in urinary calcium excretion, then the addition of a thiazide diuretic may be useful to reduce urinary calcium excretion (and to help maintain bone density). Other factors High dose vitamin C appears to increases urine oxalate excretion in ceain individuals and the risk of stone. formation; thus, high dose supplements should be avoided in those with higher urine oxalate excretion. Phytate appears to decrease the risk of stones in women. Although not simply a matter of dietary intake, higher body mass index increases the risk of stone. formation, paicularly in women. Therefore, weight control may be helpful in preventing stone recurrence. Nothing has been mentioned about dietary phosphate restriction. - Most of the urinary phosphate is derived from dietary protein. - Dietary protein restriction results in decrease in phosphate in urine. Increase intake offluid - To reach this goal, the best strategy is to reconmzend how much additional fluid the patient should drink based on his or her 24 hour urine volume. As an example, if the total urine volume is 1. 5 liters, then we recommend two additional 8 ounce (240 mL) glasses of. fluid each day to reach the goal of at least 2 liters of urine output per day. Limiting animal protein in the diet - Although it has not been proven that a low protein diet will reduce the incidence of stone formation, a high animal protein diet is a risk factor for renal stones in men, but not in women. Limiting dietary sodium to 100 meq/day - A low sodium diet can enhance proximal sodium and calcium reabsorption, leading to a reduction in calcium excretion. Increasing dietary potassium intake - As this substantially decreases risk in men and older women. Limiting dietary sucrose and fructose Limiting dietary oxalate and vitamin C in patients with calcium oxalate stones. - However, excessive limitation is not likely to be helpful; patients should continue to consume a wide variety of fruits and vegetables.",

March gangrene, a form of anterior compament syndrome, is thought to be due to edema and small hemorrhages in the muscles of the anterior compament occurring after strenuous activity in individuals not accustomed to it. Deep posterior compament syndrome also may result in foot drop as a late sequela due to resultant contracture formation. Neurologic causes of foot drop include mononeuropathies of the deep peroneal, common peroneal, or sciatic nerves. Lumbosacral plexopathy, lumbar radiculopathy, motor neuron disease, or parasagittal coical or subcoical cerebral lesions also can manifest as foot drop. These lesions can be differentiated through clinical and electrodiagnostic examinations. A common behavioral cause of foot drop is habitual crossing of the legs.

Usually occurring after compromised skin integrity because of infection or trauma, necrotizing fasciitis is manifested by flagrant inflammatory features at the site of infection that may be accompanied by hemorrhagic bullae, necrosis, and crepitus, often unresponsive to antibiotic therapy Systemic septic features may arise. Most common site Necrotizing fasciitis frequently affects the lower limbs, although any site may be involved, including the head and neck. Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum is known as Fournier's Gangrene. Etiological agents Necrotizing fasciitis can be a polymicrobial infection with a mixture of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes (Type I) or it can be monomicrobial (Type II) with group A streptococcus being the most common isolate. Predisposing, factors Predisposing factors include trauma (often trivial), burns, splinters, surgery, childbirth, diabetes mellitus, varicella, immunosuppression, renal failure, arteriosclerosis. odontogenic infection, malignancy, and alcoholism. Nonsteroidal and inflammatory agents may alter the immune response, causing a minor infection to become fulminant. Clinical manifestation Extension from a skin lesion occurs in 80% of cases. The initial lesion is often trivial, such as a minor abrasion, insect bite, injection site (drug addicts) or boil; 20% of patients have no visible skin lesion. Initially, there is a pain, erythema, edema, cellulitis, and high fever. The patient may be disoriented and lethargic. The local site shows cellulitis (90% of cases), edema (80%), skin discolouration or gangrene (70%), and anaesthesia of involved skin. A wooden-hard feel of the subcutaneous tissues is characteristic. The most consistent clinical clue is unrelenting pain out of proportion to the physical findings even if there is only mild or no fever or erythema. Typically there is diffuse swelling of an arm or leg and intense pain on palpation. About 1 or 2 days after symptom onset, the patient has a high fever, leukocytosis, edema with central patches of dusky blue discolouration, weeping blisters, and borders with cellulitis. Bullae with clear fluid rapidly turn violaceous. Septicemia may develop secondarily and should be strongly suspected in the presence of fever, anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, confusion, and hypotension. Progression to gangrene, sometimes with myonecrosis, and an extension of the inflammatory process along fascial planes are possible. Twenty-five percent will die of septic shock and organ failure Treatment Early supportive care, surgical debridement, and parenteral antibiotic administration are mandatory. All devitalized tissue should be removed to freely bleeding edges, and repeat exploration is generally indicated within 24-36 hr to confirm that no necrotic tissue remains. The mortality rate is nearly 100% without surgical debridement.",

Huhle cells have this eosinophilic appearance because of an abundance of mitochondria in the cytoplasm. They differ from follicular carcinomas in that they are more often multifocal and bilateral (-- 30%) usually do not take up RAL are more likely to metastasize to local nodes and distant sites. and are associated with a higher moality rate. Management is similar to that of follicular neoplasm (explained ahead) with lobectomy and isthmectomy being sufficient for unilateral Huhle cell adenomas. when Huhle cell neoplasms are found to be invsive on intraoperative, frozen section or definitive paraffin section histology, the total thyroidectomy is performed. These patients should also undergo routine central neck node removal and modified radical neck dissection when lateral neck nodes are palpable (similar to patients with medullary carcinoma).

        "question": "A female infant is born approximately 10 weeks prematurely (at 30 weeks) and weighs 1710 gm. She has respiratory distress syndrome and is treated with endogenous surfactant. She is intubated endotracheally with mechanical ventilation immediately after bih. Over the first 4 days after bih the ventilator pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen are reduced. Beginning on the fifth day after bih, she has brief desaturations that become more persistent. She needs increased ventilator and oxygen suppo on the seventh day after bih. She becomes cyanotic. Fuher examination, echocardiogram, and x-rays reveal left atrial enlargement, an enlarged pulmonary aery, increased pulmonary vasculature, and a continuous machine-like murmur. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Patent ductus aeriosus. The presence of a murmur could be indicative of any of the conditions. The presence of a continuous machine-likemurmur is indicative of a patent ductus aeriosus (PDA). Usually, as in this case, the premature baby with PDA does not acutely become cyanotic and ill, although brief desaturations can occur that become more persistent. An atrial septal defect (ASD), such as a persistent foramen ovale, could be eliminated from the diagnosis because the murmur would be heard as an abnormal splitting of the second sound during expiration (answer a). A patent foramen ovale is a common echo finding in premature babies and is usually not followed up unless it appears remarkable to the pediatric cardiologist or there is a persistent murmur. A patent foramen ovale might result in only minimal or intermittent cyanosis during crying or straining to pass stool. A murmur caused by a ventricular septal defect (VSD, answer c), occurs between the first and second heart sounds (S1and S2) and is described as holosystolic (pansystolic) because the amplitude is high throughout systole. Pulmonary stenosis would be heard as a harsh systolic ejection murmur (answer d). PDA refers to the maintenance of the ductus aeriosus, a normal fetal structure. In the fetus, the ductus aeriosus allows blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation, since the lungs are not involved in CO2/O2exchange until after bih. The placenta subserves the function of gas exchange during fetal development. The ductus aeriosus shunts flow from the left pulmonary aery to the aoa. High oxygen levels after bih and the absence of prostaglandins from the placenta cause the ductus aeriosus to close in most cases within 24 hours. A PDA most often corrects itself within several months of bih, but may require infusion of indomethacin (a prostaglandin inhibitor) as a treatment, inseion of surgical plugs during catheterization, or actual surgical ligation.",

        "question": "Which is NOT true about femoral aery cannulation?",
        "exp": "Single wall puncture is indicated in those with normal coagulation profile Single wall puncture is indicated in those with coagulopathy as there is more risk of bleeding in double wall puncture technique. Aerial access is obtained for hemodynamic monitoring (blood pressure monitoring, blood gases monitoring) in an intensive care unit, or for the purpose of aeriography and intervention as in vascular surgical patients. The femoral aery is one of the most frequently cannulated aeries in the body. It is commonly used for aerial access for the purpose of aeriography in the vascular surgical patient. It is a large-caliber vessel that is appropriate for using the larger-profile devices for angioplasty and stenting of the peripheral vessels. It is also commonly used in cardiac catheterization for the purpose of coronary angiography and for coronary interventions. The radial aery is the most frequently used site of aerial cannulation for hemodynamic monitoring because it is technically easy to cannulate and has a low complication rate, in pa due to the good collateral circulation of the hand. The femoral aery is the second most cannulated aery for haemodynamic monitoring. It provides a more accurate estimation of central (aoic) pressure than the radial aery. Its large-caliber is appropriate for using the larger-profile devices for angioplasty and stenting of the peripheral vessels. Femoral aery catheter complications are infrequent but are more complicated than that of the radial aery. For femoral aerial access, the puncture is made in the common femoral aery. A puncture site above the inguinal ligament, in the external iliac aery, or distally in the superficial femoral or profunda femoris aery is problematic. Disadvantage of external iliac aery: - The external iliac aery is located in the retroperitoneal space, making this aery difficult, to compress and achieve postprocedure hemostasis. (a puncture in this region can result in potentially catastrophic complication of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.) Disadvantage with superficial femoral or external iliac aery: - these aeries are substantially smaller in caliber and have a higher incidence of postprocedure thrombosis. - higer incidence of pseudoaneurysm - Additionally, the superficial. femoral aery is often heavily diseased. Localization of Common femoral aery (CFA): The CFA begins immediately behind the inguinal ligament, midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis. (A line connecting these two bony structures represents the inguinal ligament) Just below the inguinal ligament (one to two fingerbreadths distal to the inguinal ligament) the aery is closest to the surface of the skin and easily accessible. This is the optimal location of cannulation. The femoral aery is identified in the inguinal region by its pulsation. If fluoroscopy is being used, the femoral aery is typically located over the medial third of the femoral head. Note that the groin crease is unreliable in locating the ideal site of puncture and should not be used as a landmark. Femoral aery cannulation can be done using the Seldinger technique. The Seldinger technique is a medical procedure to obtain safe access to blood vessels (both aeries and veins) and other hollow organs. There are two methods of aerial wall puncture: the double-wall puncture and the single-wall puncture. The double-wall puncture involves penetrating both the anterior and posterior walls with the needle and then withdrawing the needle slowly until pulsatile blood flow is confirmed. This method is associated with a higher incidence of complications but is relatively easier. In the single-wall puncture technique, only the anterior wall of the aery is punctured with the needle, which is confirmed by pulsatile blood flow through the needle. Single wall puncture is usually the recommended technique. These two techniques can be used interchangeably and depends on the operator's preference, however-Single wall puncture is indicated in patients with coagulopathy or if thrombolysis is planned because of the increased risk of bleeding in double wall technique.

F. leak is associated with intracranial hypotension. Increased intracranial tension is not associated with spontaneous C. S. F. leak. All other options mentioned in the question are associated with spontaneous C. S. F. leak. Pseudotumor Cerebri Pseudotumour cerebri usually presents with triad of headache, papilledema and minimal or absent focal neurological signs, but rarely, the presenting feature may be a nasal C. S. F. leak. Empty sella syndrome In empty sella syndrome, the sella turcica (the bony structure which contains pituitary enlarges). In this disease there is a defect in tissue barrier that normally keeps the cerebrospinal fluid around the brain separate from the sella turcica. As a result cerebrospinal fluid puts increased pressure on the pituitary glands and the walls of the sella turcica. The sella turcica enlarges and the pituitary shrinks. The empty sella syndrome may produce no symptoms at all and seldom produces serious symptom. About half of those affected have headaches. In rare cases there is leaking of the cerebrospinal fluid from the nose. Encephathcele Encephalocele may present with C. S. F. leak. More on spontaneous C. S. F. leak or spontaneous intracranial hypotension Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a condition where patient gets postural headache due to leak of the crebrospinal fluid in the spinal membrane. What happens is that the leak causes low C. S. F. pressure within the nervous system and thus causes a string of headache to the patient. The problem with SIH is that it is hard to diagnose and there is not a great deal of information on why it occurs. It has been associated with connective tissue diseases which may involve the dura causing tear in it. To summarize it, spontaneous C. S. F. leak is very rare and unlike other causes it does not occur due to any specific traumatic event or surgical procedure in the nervous system. Although there is not much information on the possible causes of C. S. F. leak, it is suspected that an intrinsic weakness of the spinal membrane or an abnormality of the brain structure causes the rare condition. The symptoms of 51H are so small and so common that it can often be misdiagnosed.",
