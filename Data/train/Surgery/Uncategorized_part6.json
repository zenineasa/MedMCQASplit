It can be used for osteolytic spinal metastes, multiple myleoma, aggressive hemangiomas, osteoporotic veebral compression fractures. Its use has been recommended for patients with sho life expectancy or in salvage cases. It is contraindicated in infection eg TB, osteomyelitis, discitis etcQ. Veebroplasty & Kyphoplasty Veebroplasty is percutaneous placement of large spinal needles into the fractured / compressed veebral body through a channel made in the pedicle and injecting bone cement into th fractured bone. It requires high pressure injection b/o structure of the trabeculae and the high viscosity of the bone cement as it hardens. Veebroplasty was designed to decrease pain and strengthen the bone to prevent fuher collapse of a wedge compression fracture (that result from failure of anterior column by forward flexion forces). It does not restore veebral body height or prevent spinal deformity. Balloon Kyphoplasty is the next step in treatment of veebral compression fractures. This percutaneous minimally invasive procedure involves reduction & fixation performed through small instruments inseed into the veebral body through the pedicle. A small balloon is inflated to restore the height of collapsed veebral body and create a cavity inside. The balloon is deflated & withdrawn, and the remaining cavity is filled under low pressur with the surgeon's choice of material. This procedure restores veebral height & spinal alignment, which is impoant in preventing long term morbidity & moality that ariss from veebral compression fractures & spinal deformity (d/ t cardio-respiatory compromise). It stabilities veebrae internally, facilitates pain relief and restores function rapidly. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement is controlled injected in paste like consistency with fluoroscopic monitoring. 5g of barium sulfate and 2g of tungeston powder is mixed with each kit of PMMA cement to make it radiopaque enough to be visualized adqquately. Potential complications include extrusion of cement into the spinal canal, resulting in neurological compromise, infection, hematoma, pulmonary embolus, failure to relieve pain, and incomplete deformity correction. Pulmonary embolism was correlated with paraveebral venous cement leak, but not with the number of veebral bodies treated or the type of procedure (vetebroplasty or kyphoplasty).

Muir-Torre syndrome Muir-Tone syndrome is an autosomal-dominant familial cancer syndrome. The hallmark of Muir-Tone syndrome is presence of numerous sebaceous gland neoplasms, including carcinomas that may precede, follow, or coexist with visceral cancers. Visceral cancers associated with MTS are - GI tract adenocarcinoma of the colon or genitourinary tract, or lymphoma. The defining feature of this syndrome is the combination of sebaceous gland tumours and at least one visceral cancer. Typical skin tumours associated with this syndrome include sebaceous adenomas, epitheliomas and carcinomas. Keratoacanthomas and basal cell carcinomas with sebaceous differentiation also occur. All these sebaceous gland tumours are rare in the general population; the finding of such a tumour is a marker for MTS. Early recognition of the syndrome in patients with sebaceous gland tumours should facilitate early detection of subsequent malignancies if the patient is entered into appropriate screening programmes. Colorectal cancer is the commonest visceral neoplasm to occur in MTS. Cutaneous neoplasms Visceral malignancies * Sebaceous adenomas * GIT malignancies most Muir Torre * sebaceous epitheliomas commonly colorectal ca syndrome * sebaceous carcinomas * Genitourinary ca * Keratocanthoma * Basal cell carcinoma Other options: Cowden's disease or multiple hamaoma syndrome is an autosomal-dominant syndrome with numerous tumors of the hair follicles called tricholemmomas located on the face. These patients have very high risk of breast and thyroid carcinomas. Bilateral mastectomies may be recommended. Mammography and other exposure of the breast tissue to 0 radiation is contraindicated. Multiple Hamaomatous polyps occur anywhere in the GI tract. Gardner's syndrome is a variant of FAP; familial adenomatous polyposis, a colorectal cancer syndrome characterized by hundreds of adenomatous colorectal polyps, with an inevitable progression to colorectal cancer by age 40. Cutaneous manifestations may be the presenting sign and include numerous epidermal cysts and soft tissue tumors. Osteomas of mandible and skull are the most common facial lesions in Gardner syndrome. Gardner syndrome is characterized by: - Colorectal polyposis - Epidermoid cysts - Desmoid tumors - Osteomas - Thyroid neoplasms, and - Congenital hyperophy of the retinal pigment epithelium Turcot's syndrome is also a variant of FAP characterized by: - Colorectal polyposis - Brain tumors (Medulloblastoma, Glioblastoma multiforme) Also Know: Gorlin-Goltz syndrome or Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is characterized by the presence of multiple basal cell carcinomas, numerous bony abnormalities, and a strong predisposition for malignancy.

Here in this question, it's not mentioned whether the recurrence is after an acid-reducing operation or simply after medications. Lets first take the case of recurrence after a previous acid reducing surgery (this is most probably what the examiner means by recurrent ulcer as this topic is described in quite a detail in Maingot's) Recurrence after a prior acid reducing surgery: The management of patients with recurrent ulcer disease after acid-reducing operations consists of antibiotics directed at H. pylori + treatment with an antisecretory medication + limitation of NSAID use, smoking cessation, and limitation of alcohol intake. Ulcer disease refractory to such treatment is unusual. If the ulcer persists for more than 3 months despite eradication of H. pylori and maintenance antisecretory therapy or the ulcer is associated with perforation, bleeding, or obstruction, the operation is indicated. The choice of operation for recurrent postoperative ulcer depends on the indication for initial operation & the operation performed previously. Since these ulcers have recurred despite prior peptic ulcer disease surgery and maximal medical therapy, surgery should be appropriately aggressive. Truncal vagotomy with antrectomy is the operation of choice. This is the procedure with the least recurrence rate. Recurrence after prior treatment by medications: If at all surgery is needed an operation with least morbidity is advised i. e. Highly selective vagotomy. Recurrent gastric ulcer: Non-healing gastric ulcers despite antibiotics and antisecretory drugs should be viewed with suspicion for malignancy (Duodenal ulcers have no risk of malignancy) and thus distal gastrectomy is the recommended operation. Other surgical options are wedge resection with HSV. (Note HSV is of no use in Type I and Type IV ulcers as these are associated with acid hyposecretion)",

Each segment has its own vascular inflow, outflow and biliary drainage. In the centre of each segment there is a branch of the poal vein, hepatic aery and bile duct. In the periphery of each segment there is vascular outflow through the hepatic veins. Right hepatic vein divides the right lobe into anterior and posterior segments. Middle hepatic vein divides the liver into right and left lobes (or right and left hemiliver). This plane runs from the inferior vena cava to the gallbladder fossa. Left hepatic vein divides the left lobe into a medial and lateral pa. Poal vein divides the liver into upper and lower segments. The left and right poal veins branch superiorly and inferiorly to project into the center of each segment. Because of this division into self-contained units, each segment can be resected without damaging those remaining. For the liver to remain ble, resections must proceed along the vessels that define the peripheries of these segments. This means, that resection-lines parallel the hepatic veins. The centrally located poal veins, bile ducts, and hepatic aeries are preserved",

        "exp": "MR1 Age group, swelling at mid-shaft of. femur, low grade. fever, mildly raised ESR & laminated periosteal reaction; all point towards the diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma. But Osteomyelitis can also be put in d/d. Only point which goes against osteomyelitis is the location i. e. the mid-shaft of femur. Osteomyelitis is commonly seen at metaphysis, although diaphysis can be rarely involved. Grainger writes-\"The differential diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma includes osteomyelitis, other lyric bone lesions, osteosarcorna and metastases from another primary tumour. The routine imaging algorithm of these patients includes plain radiography and MRI of the primary lesion, bone scintigraphy of the skeleton looking for metastatic bone spread and plain radiography and CT for chest evaluation of metastases. \" \"When a large soft-tissue mass is present it can still be difficult to differentiate between tumour and infection, even with Gadolinium enhancement. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. \" In this case X ray has already been done. Next investigation should be MRI (or CT; MR is better). MRI is ideally suited for evaluating the soft tissues, the intramedullary extent of disease, and adjacent soft-tissue involvement of the primary lesion and is an essential pa of the evaluation of a patient with Ewing's sarcoma. Biopsy is done to confirm the diagnosis and rule out osteomyelitis and other bone tumors. Bone scintigraphy is done to look for bone metastases. CT chest is done to look for any lung metastasis. Ewing's sarcoma: Ewing's sarcoma of bone is a highly anaplastic, small, round cell tumor of neuroectodermal origin. It is an aggressive malignancy with a high local recurrence and metastatic rate. Ewing sarcoma is the second most common primary malignancy of bone (after osteosarcoma) in patients younger than 30 years of age and the most common in patients younger than 10 years of age. The most common locations include the metaphyses of long bones (often with extension into the diaphysis) and the flat bones of the shoulder and pelvic girdles. Ewing sarcoma is exceedingly rare in individuals of African descent. Clinical findings: Pain is an almost universal complaint of patients with Ewing sarcoma. Usually the onset is insidious, and the pain may be of long duration before the patient seeks medical attention, The pain may be only mild and intermittent initially and may respond to initial conservative treatment. In addition to pain, patients also may have fever, erythema, and swelling suggesting osteomyelitis. Diagnosis: Laboratory studies may reveal an increased white blood cell count, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and an elevated C-reactive protein. Ewing sarcoma appears radiographically as a central lytic tumor of the diaphyseal-metaphyseal bone. It creates extensive permeative destruction of coical bone, and as it breaks through under the periosteum, it takes on a typical onionskin, multilaminated appearance; however, this is not pathognomonic for Ewing's sarcoma. Radiating spicules of new bone in a sunburst pattern (sun-ray appearance) can also occur, making radiographic differentiation from osteosarcoma difficult. Saucer-shaped destruction of the exterior coex is a fairly characteristic feature. Regardless of the location, MRI of the entire bone should be ordered to evaluate the full extent of the lesion, which typically extends beyond the abnormality apparent on plain films. MRI also is useful to evaluate the extent of the soft-tissue mass, which often is very large. All patients should have a baseline radiograph and a CT scan of the chest because the lung is the most common site of metastases. A bone scan should be performed because bone is the second most common site of metastases. Histologically, Ewing sarcoma consists of small blue cells with very little intercellular matrix. Cytogenetic or immunohistochemical studies often are required to differentiate Ewing sarcoma from other small blue cell tumors. The t(11; 22)(q24; q12) is the most common translocation diagnostic of Ewing sarcoma and is present in greater than 90% of cases. Immunohistochemical staining for the MIC2 gene product has been repoed to be specific for Ewing sarcoma. In addition, Ewing sarcomas usually are periodic acid-Schiff positive (owing to intracellular glycogen) and reticulin negative. This is in contrast to lymphomas, which are periodic acid-Schiff negative and reticulin positive. Treatment The prognosis is always poor and surgery alone does little to improve it. Radiotherapy has a dramatic effect on the tumor but overall survival is not much enhanced. Chemotherapy is much more effective. The best results are obtained by a combination of all three methods: a course of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy; then wide excision if the tumor is in a ourable site, or radiotherapy.. followed by local excision if it is less accessible,. and then a. fuher course of chemotherapy. for 1 year. Postoperative radiotherapy may be added if the resected specimen is found not to have a sufficiently wide margin of normal tissue.",

Perform VCUG and renal-bladder ultrasonography in any child with documented UTI before age 5 years, any child with pyelonephritis, and any male child with a symptomatic UTI. A renal-bladder ultrasonography may be used to screen older children with UTI. If ultrasonographic findings are abnormal, conduct fuher workup studies with VCUG to rule out VUR. During the initial workup in a patient with suspected reflux, perform the standard VCUG, which provides clear anatomic detail and allows accurate grading of the reflux degree. By filling and emptying the bladder several times (cycling) with the catheter still in the bladder, as described by Lebowitz, the yield of identifying VUR is clearly enhanced. The conventional cystography provides more anatomical accuracy than nuclear cystography; however, nuclear cystography is advantageous (used widely to monitor VUR) because of lower radiation exposure and increased sensitivity.",

It is the result of an increased body pool of urate with hyperuricemia. It is typically characterized by episodic acute and chronic ahritis, due to deposition of Monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joints and connective tissue tophi, and the risk for deposition in kidney interstitium or uric acid nephrolithiasis. If the clinical appearance strongly suggests gout, the diagnosis should be confirmed by needle aspiration of acutely or chronically involved joints or tophaceous deposits. Acute septic ahritis, several of the other crystalline-associated ahropathies, palindromic rheumatism, and psoriatic ahritis may present with similar clinical features. During acute gouty attacks, strongly birefringent needle-shaped MSU crystals with negative elongation are typically seen both intracellularly and extracellularly.

The clinical symptoms are because of the effects of hypoglycaemia (sweating, tremor, palpitations, confusion, headache, disorientation, visual difficulties, irrational behavior, or even coma) The diagnosis of insulinoma requires the demonstration of an elevated plasma insulin level at the time of hypoglycemia. This is because insulinomas do not reduce the secretion of insulin in the presence of hypoglycaemia. Whereas in a normal person, insulin levels would decrease with decrease in blood glucose levels. The most reliable test to diagnose insulinoma is a fast up to 72 h with serum glucose, and insulin measurements every 4-8 h. The test is terminated if the the patient becomes symptomatic or glucose levels are <40 mg/dL (2. 2 mmol/L). Diagnosis of insulinoma is made if: - A serum insulin level of 6 microunit/mL or more in the presence of blood glucose values below 40 mg/dL - ratio of plasma insulin to glucose is > 0. 3 In addition to the above criteria, some other measurements are also required before making the diagnosis of insulinoma - C-peptide level - serum proinsulin level, - serum sulfonylurea levels These additional tests are used because any hidden use of insulin or oral hypoglycemics taken by the patient would resemble insulinoma causing high levels of insulin in presence of hypoglycaemia. The combination of elevated proinsulin levels (normal in exogenous insulin/hypoglycemic agent users), elevated C-peptide levels (low in exogenous insulin users), antibodies to insulin (positive in exogenous insulin users), and measurement of sulfonylurea levels in serum or plasma will allow the correct diagnosis to be made.",

Veebroplasty and kvphoplasty Veebroplasty and kyphoplasty are interventional radiologic procedures for the treatment of the intense pain refractory to medical management or bracing caused by veebral compression fracture associated with osteoporosis, tumors, and trauma.

Veebroplasty may also be applied prophylactically to an at-risk veebra between 2 other abnormal veebrae. Veebroplasty does not restore the height of the compressed veebral body. A related procedure, kyphoplasty, is intended to restore lost height by inflating a balloon pump within and between the fracture fragments prior to the infusion of the cement. Both procedures result in similar relief of pain due to veebral compression fractures. The risks of the procedure are low and include extravasation of cement into the epidural space causing myelopathy, or fatal pulmonary embolism from extension of cement into paraspinous veins. Indications for percutaneous veebroplasty Osteoporotic veebral compression fractures more than two weeks old in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine causing moderate to severe pain and unresponsive to conservative therapy. Painful metastasis and multiple myeloma with or without adjuvant radiation or surgical therapy. Painful veebral hemangiomas Veebral osteonecrosis. Reinforcement of a pathologically weak veebral body before a surgical stabilization procedure. Contraindication for percutaneous veebroplasty Contraindications are: - 1. Absolute Osteoporotic veebral fracture that is completely healed or is clearly responding to conservative management. Presence of untreated coagulopathy. Presence of discitis/osteomyelitis (septic or tubercular) or sepsis. 2. Relative Significant compromise of the spinal canal by retropulsed bone fragment or tumor. Fracture older than one year. Greater than 80-90% collapse of the veebral body.",

Many classification schemes have been proposed. In the original scheme of Wright and Moll, five patterns are described; Asymmetric: This type affects around 70% of patients and is generally mild. This type does not occur in the same joints on both sides of the body and usually only involves fewer than 3 joints. Symmetric: This type accounts for around 25% of cases, and affects joints on both sides of the body simultaneously. This type is most similar to rheumatoid ahritis and is disabling in around 50% of all cases. Ahritis mutilans: Affects less than 5% of patients and is a severe, deforming and destructive ahritis.

        "exp": "This is a case of trigger finger, which is most common in is most common in the sixth decade, women, people with diabetes, and the dominant hand. Trigger finger is caused by inflammation and constriction of the retinacular sheath through which the flexor tendons run as they pass from the palm of the hand into the finger. This causes irritation of the tendon, sometimes resulting in the formation of a nodule, which impinges on the pulley, causing pain and restricting movement. Treatment: Coicosteroid injection into the tendon sheath is usually the first line treatment. Up to 57% of cases resolve with one injection, and 86% with two. Surgery--Usually indicated if two coicosteroid injections six weeks apa have failed, or the finger is irreversibly locked in flexion. Surgery to release the pulley is done as a day case through a palmar incision under local anaesthetic. Cure rates approach 100%. Splinting for six weeks can decrease inflammation. This is an option for those wishing to avoid injections or surgery. Congenital triggering usually presents in the first year of life. The digit is locked in flexion or extension. Steroid injections have no role in management; instead, refer to a hand surgeon. Ref: Benson L, Ptaszek A. Injection versus surgery in the treatment of trigger finger.

The predominant symptom is dyspnea, which is usually not apparent in the previously healthy young woman until the disease has advanced. When signs of pulmonary hypertension are apparent from physical findings, chest x-ray, or echocardiography, the diagnosis of recurrent pulmonary embolus must be ruled out. In this case, a normal perfusion lung scan makes pulmonary angiography unnecessary. Restrictive lung disease should be ruled out with pulmonary function testing.

        "question": "A 7yr. old boy with abrupt onset of pain in hip with hip held in abduction. Hernogram is normal. ESR is raised. What is the next line of management:",
        "exp": "USG guided aspiration of hip There are two very common causes of an acute hip/groin pain, which commonly are very challenging to diagnose: septic ahritis and transient synovitis. Septic ahritis and transient synovitis are completely unrelated, although both might manifest with hip pain, restricted range of movement of the hip. Differentiating between these two is vital, because while transient synovitis is a benign self-limiting disorder, the septic ahritis if untreated is catastrophic with permanent damage to the hip. Treatment for septic ahritis and for transient synovitis is entirely different. While transient synovitis can be managed by observation and anti-inflammatory agents; septic ahritis needs aggressive management with intravenous antibiotics with or without surgical debridement. Lets, first see the two conditions and the differences between them: Transient synovitis (also k/a toxic synovitis, observation hip. irritable hip) Its a self-limiting, inflammatory condition of the synovium, that lasts only a sho time (therefore k/a transient) Its the most CO/11111. On cause of hip pain and limp in children under 10 yrs of age. Although the cause of transient synovitis is unclear, evidence suggests it is associated with immune responses to viral or bacterial antigens, mediated through the synol membrane. Synol fluid rapidly accumulates under pressure in the hip joint, and there may be severe pain from capsular distension. The fluid is resorbed within 3-7 days, with no long term sequelae. Presentation is with hip pain or limp. Hip can be held in flexion, abduction and external rotation depending on the degree of effusion. Physical examination is characterized by guarded rotation of the hip joint. Pain can usually be elicited at the extremes of motion, especially abduction and medial rotation. The ESR and C-reactive protein are usually normal but may be mildly elevated. The WBC count is generally normal with a normal differential. Rest is the primary method of treatment (thus it's also k/a observation hip). In most patients the symptoms resolve in 3 to 7 days. Differentiation from septic ahritis: The very impoant distinction between transient synovitis and septic ahritis is in the first instance clinical. The patient with transient synovitis is not sick, appears cheerful and healthy and, if there is fever, it is usually of a low-grade nature. Whereas a child with septic process is seriously ill, with high grade fever. Pain is severe and the patient is unable to bear weight. A patient of transient synovitis may be able to walk with a limp, however depending on the extent of effusion the pain in transient synovitis may also be severe enough as to render the child incapable of walking. In septic ahritis, WBC count, ESR and C-reactive protein are significantly raised. U/S may show joint fluid in both the conditions. \"Within the past 5 years three excellent papers have been published that help differentiate between benign, transient synovitis and the potentially dangerous septic ahritis. In the two studies by Kocher et al - A history of fever, together with - Non-Weight bearing, and - ESR higher than 40 mm, and - A serum WBC count higher than 12000 cells/mm3 all pointed clearly toward septic ahritis. The probability of having septic ahritis with all four predictor was 99. 6%. However, in a study Luhmann et al the probability was only 59% with all four predictors. They found that a history of fever, a WBC> 12000. and a previous health care visit yielded a 71% probability of septic ahritis. \"Current diagnosis & treatment in spos medicine By Patrick J. Mc. Mahon 1/e p210 Now lets come to the question. Here we see that the information supplied is insufficient. ESR is raised but how much, its not given. The WBC count is normal, so we can think in lines of Transient synovitis, but Turek ohopaedics writes about septic ahritis- \"The peripheral WBC count is usually elevated, as is the sedimentation rate, although the diagnosis of septic ahritis should not be excluded simply on the basis of normal values for these two studies. \" So here the diagnosis is unceain. Thus we will proceed with usg guided aspiration of the hip as the next line of management. \"Aspiration of the joint must be done when the diagnosis is unceain. \"- Turek Ohopaedics \"Joint aspiration is mandatory for fluid analysis and culture of the synol fluid in cases of septic ahritis.: \" - T14rek ohopaedics",

The radius revolves on the ulna about an axis which passes through the centre of the head of the radius above and the styloid process of the ulna below, which line if prolonged would pass through the ring finger. In pronation, the hand lies with the palm down and the radius is crossed diagonally over the ulna; the bones are close together. In supination the hand lies with the palm up, the bones lie parallel to one another and widely separated. In the mid-position the radius lies above the ulna and the space between them is at its maximum. The head of the radius rotates in the orbicular ligament, the lower end of the radius revolves around the head of the ulna and rests on the interaicular triangular fibrocailage. The radius is pronated by the pronator teres and pronator quadratus muscles. It is supinated by the brachioradialis, supinator (brevis), and biceps muscles. Some of the other muscles also aid slightly in these movements, especially the flexor carpi radialis in pronation.

C. G. abnormalities. - It stabilizes the myocardium immediately. - It acts within minutes and is characterized by improvement an impoant in point E. C. to G. note appearance. But - It does not affect transcellular movement of potassium. Thus it won't help in reducing the hyperkalemia. Among the agents which cause transcellular (intracellular) movement of potassium. - \"Intravenous insulin is the fastest wav to lower serum potassium levels\". The goals of the therapy for the tit of acute hyperkalemia in chronological order are as follows:? i) Antagonize the affect of IC on excitable cell membranes ii) Redistribution of extracellular potassium into cells iii) Enhance elimination of potassium. from the body i) Antagonize the effect of potassium on excitable cell membrane Calcium directly antagonizes the myocardial effect of hyperkalemia. It does so by reducing the threshold potential of cardiac myocytes. Calcium for injection is available as chloride or gluconate salt. The preferred agent is the gluconate salt since it is less likely than calcium chloride to cause tissue necrosis. The onset of action is < 3 minutes. The duration of action is 30-60 minutes during which time fuher measures may be undeaken to lower pK. ii) Redistribution of potassium into cells:? Insulin Insulin shifts potassium into cells. Potassium shift inside the cells is mediated by Na+ ATPase. I. V. insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium level Q. The onset of action is < 15 minutes and the effect is maximal b/w 30-60 minutes. Dextrose is given along with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. It was believed that administration of dextrose alone, can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin release. The administration of hypeonic dextrose alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasons:- Endogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for a therapeutic effect. - There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypeonicity. ftadrenoceptor agonists These drugs can also cause movement of potassium inside the cell. High dose albuterol shows their effect in 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours. The effect of insulin is additive with that of albuterol. Patients taking nonselective 13 adrenoceptor blockers will be unlikely to manifest the hypokalemic effects of albuterol. - Even among patients not taking fi blockers as many as 40% seem to he resistant to the hypokalemic effect of albuterol. - The mechanism. for this resistance is unknown and currently, there is no basis for predicting which patients will respond. - For this reason albuterol should never be used as a single agent for the treatment of urgent hyperkalemia. Bicarbonate Bicarbonate (as a bolus injection) was used in the emergency t/t of hyperkalemia. Ironically this dogma was based on studies using a prolonged (4-6 hrs) infusion of bicarbonate. It has now been demonstrated that sho term bicarbonate infusion does not reduce pK in patients with dialysis dependent kidney failure, implying that it does not cause IC+ shift into cells. Sodium bicarbonate seems to have no effect to shift IC+ into cells even after several hours. It is likely to be effective especially in combination with a diuretic drug in enhancing urinary r elimination in patients with some kidney function, although it use. for this purpose has not been evaluated. iii) Elimination of potassium from the body Hyperkalemia occurs most often in patients with renal insufficiency. - However renal potassium excretion may be enhanced even in patients with significant renal impairment by increasing the delivery of solute to the distal nephron. Sodium bicarbonate A sodium bicarbonate infusion administered during 4-6 hrs at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine may enhance urinary K+ excretion and would be desirable especially in patients with metabolic acidosis. The risk of volume expansion with the bicarbonate infusion can he mitigated by use of loop acting diuretics which would, be likely to enhance the kaliuresis. Exchange resin Sodium poly. vterene sulfonate is a cation exchange resin. In the lumen of intestine it exchanges sodium for secreted potassium. Most of this exchange takes place in the colon, the site of most potassium secretion in the gut. There are two concerns with the use of resin in the tit of urgent hyperkalemia The first is its slow effect - When given orally. the onset of action is at least 2 hrs and the maximum effect may not be seen. for more than 6 hrs. The second is its adverse effect - It can cause intestinal necrosis Dialysis -\"llemodialysis is the method of choice for removing potassium from the body\". - The rate of potassium removed with peritoneal dialysis is much slower than with hetnodialysis.",

Microscopic examination of a series of peripheral blood smears taken during the course of a staphylococcal infection indicates that the bactericidal capacity of the boy's neutrophils is impaired or absent. What is the most likely cause of this child's illness?",
        "exp": "Patients with chronic granulomatous disease have defective functioning of phagocytic neutrophils and monocytes due to an inability to produce hydrogen peroxide. That is, their phagocytic cells have a decreased oxidative or respiratory burst. The most common cause of chronic granulomatous disease is defective NADPH oxidase, which is an enzyme on the membrane of lysosomes that conves O2 to superoxide and stimulates oxygen burst. This deficiency results in recurrent infections with catalasepositive organisms, such as S. aureus. The classic form of chronic granulomatous disease usually affects boys and causes death before the age of 10. Key findings in chronic granulomatous disease include lymphadenitis, hepatosplenomegaly, eczematoid dermatitis, pulmonary infiltrates that are associated with hypergammaglobulinemia, and defective ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria. A defect in the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) is seen in the autosomal recessive (Swiss) form of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID), while a defect in the IL-2 receptor is seen in the X-linked recessive form of SCID. A developmental defect at the pre-B stage is seen in X-linked agammaglobulinemia of Bruton, while developmental failure of pharyngeal pouches 3 and 4 is characteristic of Di. George's syndrome.",

A: Seminoma Tumours of the testis are classified according to their predominant cellular types: Seminoma (40%) Teratomas (32%) subdivided into: - Teratoma differentiated - Malignant teratoma intermediate - Malignant teratoma undifferentiated - Malignant teratoma trophoblastic (choriocarcinoma is the most lethal form and it is the least common at 1% of the non-seminomatous type) Combined seminoma and teratoma (14%) Interstitial tumours (1. 5%) Risk factors include: Cryptorchidism or testicular maldescent. Klinefelter's syndrome. Family history. Male infeility (increases risk by a factor of three). Low bih weight, young maternal age, young paternal age, multiparity, breech delivery. Infantile hernia. Height - taller men are more at risk of developing germ cell tumours. Testicular microlithiasis (small intratesticular calcifications seen on ultrasound). Diagnosis is usually confirmed by ultrasound. Tissue histology can follow an inguinal orchidectomy. Disease can be staged by thoraco-abdominal CT scanning. Tumour markers are useful in staging and assessing response to treatment. Alpha-fetoprotein is produced by yolk sac elements but not produced by seminomas. Beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin is produced by trophoblastic elements and so may be elevated levels in both teratomas and seminomas. LDH should be measured. Tumour markers are present in 75% of teratomas. Royal Marsden staging of testicular tumours: Stage I - disease confined to the testis. Stage IM - as Stage I but with tumour markers rising after operation. Stage II - para-aoic lymph node involvement with fuher division into Stage IIA with nodes5 cm in diameter. Stage III - the disease has spread above the diaphragm with fuher subdivision into A, B and C as for Stage II. Stage IV - extra lymphatic metastases. - Stage L1 - - Stage L2 - >3 lung metastases but all Stage L3 - >3 lung metastases with 1 or more >2 cm in diameter. Stage H+ - liver metastases.

Management Management of colonoscopic perforation depends upon the size of the perforation, the duration of time since the injury, and the overall condition of the patient A large perforation recognized during the procedure requires surgical exploration. Because the bowel has almost always been prepared prior to the colonoscopy, there is usually little contamination associated with these injuries and most can be repaired primarily. If there is significant contamination, if there has been a delay in diagnosis with resulting peritonitis, or if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, proximal diversion with or without resection is the safest approach. Occasionally, a patient will develop abdominal pain and localized signs of perforation after what was thought to be an uneventful colonoscopy. Many of these patients will have a \"microperforation\" which will resolve with bowel rest, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and close observation. Evidence of peritonitis or any deterioration in clinical condition mandates exploration. Similarly, free retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal air may be discovered incidentally after colonoscopy. In a completely asymptomatic patient, this finding is thought to result from barotrauma and dissection of air through tissue planes without a free perforation. Many of these patients canbe successfully treated with bowel rest & broad-spectrum antibiotics. Surgical exploration is indicated for any clinical deterioration.",

[The \"rim sign, \" originally repoed by Smith in 1995, is described as a rim, ring, or halo of soft tissue visible on CT scans that completely surrounds ureteral stones. The effect is enhanced by the local inflammation a stone produces in the ureteral wall, with subsequent edema at the site of the calculus. The rim sign is generally missing or incomplete with phleboliths. While not absolutely definitive, the rim sign is strong evidence that the calcific density it surrounds is a stone and not a phlebolith. In several studies, more than 75% of all ureteral stones demonstrated a rim sign, while only 2-8% of phleboliths demonstrated it. The rim sign is more likely to be present in small or medium stones up to 5 mm in diameter. Larger stones, bigger 6 mm, tend to lose the rim sign, presumably from stretching and thinning of the ureteral wall around a relatively large calculus. (Reff*",

Low levels of aldosterone stimulation of the renal distal tubule leads to sodium wasting in the urine and H+ retention in the serum.

As the O2 is continuously absorbed by the middle ear mucosa it results in negative middle ear pressure unless the Eustachian tube opens to replenish the ear. Negative pressure leads to transudation of fluid into the middle ear and if the hypoxia continues a mucoid exudate is produced by the glands of middle ear mucosa (glue ear). Majority of children need no treatment. but, if required, surgery is the only effective way of curing glue ear and both ventilation tube (grommet) and adenoidectomy are effective.

At about the fouh week of embryonic life, 4 branchial (or pharyngeal) clefts develop between 5 ridges known as the branchial (or pharyngeal) arches. These arches and clefts contribute to the formation of various structures of the head and neck. The second arch grows downwards and ultimately covers the third and fouh arches. The buried clefts normally disappear around the seventh week of development. If a poion of the cleft remains entrapped and fails to disappear, its remnants form a cyst. Branchial cleft cysts are the most common of congenital neck masses. They are bilateral in about 2-3% of the cases. Usually, they do not appear at bih, but become noticeable much later in life. They are usually lined by squamous epithelium, and contains thick, turbid fluid full of cholesterol crystals. They are usually located at the junction of the upper third and middle third of the sternomastoid muscle at its anterior border. It is a fluctuant swelling that may transilluminate. If they get infected, they may form a deep neck abscess or a draining fistula. USG and fine-needle aspiration both aids diagnosis. The treatment of branchial cleft cysts is surgical excision.",

Option (d) - After vomitting the child has voracious appetite, that leads to a cycle of feeding and vomiting. Option (c) \"Greater awareness of pyloric stenosis has led to earlier identification of patients with fewer instances of chronic malnutrition and severe dehydration\" -Nelson I7/e Option (b) - The diagnosis of pyloric stenosis is usually made by palpation - of the typical olive shaped hard pyloric mass located in right upper quadrant. In healthy infants when palpation is difficult, feeding can help in the diagnosis. After feeding gastric peristalsis waves may be visible. After the infant vomits, the abdominal musculature is more relaxed and the mass is easier to palpate. Sedation can also be used to facilitate examination but is usually unnecessary.

        "exp": "Paget disease The clinical and lab. findings in this elderly male along with characteristic x-ray findings are indicative of Paget ds. Paget disease Paget disease, a relatively common bone disorder, is a chronic progressive disturbance in bone metabolism that primarily effects older persons. Male > Females (3: 2) Pathology The basic pathological process in Paget disease involves the balance between hone resorption and new bone formation (Osteoclastic and osteoblastic bone activity) The disease passes through three stages: 1st - Oeolytic or hot phase - the pathological process is initiated by overactive osteoclastic bone resorption. IInd - Intermediatior Mixed phase - Osteoclastic hone resorption is followed by compensatory increase in osteoblastic new bone formation. 111rd - Cool Phase - this is sclerotic phase in which the osteoblastic activity is greatly in excess of osteoclastic resorption, leading to marked thickening of bony trabeculae and coex. New pagetic bone is structurally disorganized and more susceptible to bowing and fracture. Although most patients are asymptomatic, a variety of symptoms and complications may result directly from bony involvement or secondarily from the expansion of bone and subsequent compression of neural tissue (sensorineural hearing loss in this patient due to compression of choclear nerve from temporal bone involvement) Biochemically the increase in osteoblastic activity is reflected in elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase which can rise to extremely high values. The increase in osteoclastic bone resorption is reflected in high urinary levels of hydroxyproline, which is formed as a result of collagen breakdown. Distribution The distribution of the disease varies from monostotic involvement to widespread disease. Pelvis is the most commonly involved bone followed by femur, skull, tibia, veebrae. Clinical manifestations Asymptomatic patients are often diagnosed by discovery of an elevated alkaline phosphatase level on routine blood chemistry or from an abnormality on a skeletal radiograph obtained for other reasons. Pain is the most common presenting symptom. It occurs due to increased bony vascularity, expanding lytic lesions, fractures, bowing or other deformities of the extremities. Bowing of the femur or tibia causes gait abnormalities and abnormal mechanical stresses with secondary osteoahritis of the hip or knee joints. Back pain results due to enlarged pagetic veebrae, veebral compression fractures, spinal stenosis or kyphosis. Skull involvement may cause headache, symmetric or assymmetric enlargement of the parietal or frontal bones (frontal bossing) and increased head size Cranial expansion may narrow cranial foramine and cause neurological complications including hearing loss from choclear nerve damage from temporal bone involvement, cranial nerve palsies, and softening of the base of the skull (platybasia) and the risk of brainstem compression. Pagetic involvement of the facial bones may cause facial deformities, loss of teeth or other dental conditions. Other complications are - Fractures (most common complication) - Neoplastic transformation: development of bone sarcoma (most commonly osteosarcoma) is a rare but serious complication of Paget disease. - Cardiovascular complications: The extensive aeriovenous shunting and marked increase in blood flow through the vascular pagetic bone leads to a high output state and cardiac enlargement. Diagnosis The diagnosis may be suggested on clinical examination by the enlarged skull with frontal bossing, bowing of an extremity, or sho stature with simian posturing. A warm extremity on palpation may suggest an underlying pagetic bone Radiological findings Radiographic features depend on the stage of the disorder In the early osteolytic phase - active bone resorption is evident as a radioluscent wedged area in long bones termed as 'candle flame' or 'blade of grass'. - in the flat bones such as the calvarium or the iliac bone, purely osteolytic lesion is noted, k/a osteoporosis circumscripta Later phases of new bone formation - Bone remodelling appears radiographically as thickening of the coex, coarse trabeculation and enlargement or expansion of an entire bone or area of a long bone. - Veebral coical thickening of the superior and inferior end plates creates a 'picture frame veebra'. - Diffuse radiodense enlargement of a veebra is referred to as 'ivory veebra'. - Skull x ray shows focal patchy densities - cotton ball appearance, which is quite characteristic of Paget disease. - Pelvic radiograph demonstrate disruption or fusion of the sacro-iliac joints and softening with protrusio acetabuli - Long bones reveal bowing deformities and typical pagetic changes of coical thickening and expansion and areas of lucency and sclerosis. Biochemical findings - T alkaline phosphatase levels (indicative of osteoblastic activity, marker of bone (formation) - T Urinary hydroxyproline levels (marker of bone resorption) [The parallel rise in serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels confirm bone formation and resorption in Paget disease} The degree of bone marker elevation reflects the extent and severity of the disease. - Urinary and serum deoxypyridinoline N-telopeptide, and C-telopeptide levels are products of degradation and are more specific for bone resorption than hydroxyproline. - Serum calcium and phosphate levels are normal Treatment - Paget disease is treated with drugs which suppress the very high rates of bone resorption and secondarily decrease the high rates of bone formation Bisphosphonates - Etidronate - A lendronare - Tiludronate - Risedronate - Pamidronate Calcitonin",

They may be relative or absolute contraindications. They can be considered relative, if the contraindication is provided with additional care, one can overcome the complication. In other words, given the situation, the patient is made fit to undergo extraction, once the underlying condition is treated. On the contrary, there are a few conditions which are absolute contraindications. These factors will be the impediments for extraction, even if care is taken. If extraction is carried out in the presence of such absolute contraindications, the outcome may be even fatal. Hence, it is essential to differentiate between these two types of contraindications. To avoid legal consequences, it is preferable to avoid extraction, if the contraindication is absolute. The contraindications may also be classified as systemic or local factors. The presence of absolute systemic contraindications indicates that this group of diseases exists in an uncontrolled state. No attempt should be made by the dental surgeon to thrust extraction on such patients. By doing so the clinician will be inviting disaster, e. g. metabolic disorders like uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled cardiac problems, leukemia, renal failure and liver disorders like cirrhosis of liver. Local contraindications: The most common local contraindication is an ongoing acute inflammatory or infectious process. The acute infection/inflammation should first be treated before proceeding with the extraction, depending on the location of the acute process. Extraction of a third lower molar during an ongoing acute pericoronitis could lead to a lifethreatening postoperative infection. However, there are also situations where an acute abscess is best drained by extraction of the tooth even in an acute phase. An acute infectious process caused by pulpal disease is resolved most quickly by extraction of the tooth. Therefore an acute infectious and inflammatory process should not be considered as an absolute contraindication for extraction",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Ulnar Nerve Ulnar Nerve I. Lesion at the elbow The term cubital tunnel syndrome is often used for ulnar nerve compression at the elbow. Total paralysis of the nerve, including those branches of the nerve serving the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, causes wasting along medial side of forearm. Paralysis of the nerve also leads to weakness of flexion of fouh and fifth fingers; if proximal poions of these fingers are held steady, patient is unable to flex terminal phalanges. With paralysis of hypothenar muscles, abduction of fifth finger is impossible. Paralysis of interossei and medial two lumbricals causes 'claw hand' deformity, mainly seen in the ulnar fingers. There may be wasting of hypothenar muscles, interossei and medial pa of thenar eminence. Also there is weakness in movement of fingers and abduction to the extended thumb against the palm. There is sensory loss of the dorsal and palmar aspects of the medial side of the hand together with the medial one and a half fingers. With compression of the ulnar nerve, the ulnar nerve is often palpably enlarged in the ulnar groove and for a sho distance proximal to the elbow. II. Lesion at the wrist Cutaneous sensation of hand and fingers is often spared. If lesion is just proximal to the wrist, it causes impaired sensation on the palmar aspects of hand and the fouh and fifth fingers and muscle weakness, especially in the hypothenar eminence. Adductor pollicis will be injured in ulnar nerve injuries so patient will hold the book by using the flexor pollicis longus (supplied by median nerve). This is the basis of book test/froment sign. Positive Tinel's sign on percussion over ulnar nerve at wrist (light percussion over the nerve causes a sensation of \"pins and needles\" in the distribution of the nerve, i. e. ulnar side of hand and fouh and fifth fingers).

The newest addition, a fusion PET-CT scan, allows for detection of metastatic deposits and has added tissue-based resolution of CT scan. A suspicion of colorectal cancer diagnosis warrants rectal examination and colonoscopy with a biopsy of suspicious lesion. Colonoscopy is the investigation of choice if colorectal cancer is suspected provided the patient is fit enough to undergo bowel preparation. - Sigmoidoscopy - Double contrast barium enema is indicated when colonoscopy is contraindicated.",

Vas deferens carries the sperms from epididymis to the urethra where they open by separate openings into the prostatic urethra. Just before opening each vas deferens is joined by ducts of seminal vesicles. Vas deferens and seminal vesicle ducts join to form the ejaculatory duct. The secretions of seminal vesicles form a large part of seminal fluid and contain fructose and a coagulating enzyme called the vesiculase. Now coming to the question. Semen analysis forms an important part of infertility assessment. Low ejaculatory volume is caused by retrograde ejaculation into the bladder or obstruction of the vas deferens or the ejaculatory duct Azoospermia may be seen in testicular failure or obstruction of vas deferens Absence of fructose suggests seminal vesicles agenesis or obstruction. A semen that is low in volume with azoospermia and absence of fructose suggests -> either obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts or congenital absence of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles. The anatomy of the vas deferens & seminal vesicles can be investigated by vasography (where contrast medium is injected into the vas deferens) or TRUS (Trans rectal ultrasonography), however TRUS is superior to vasography and is the investigation of choice.

But ceain lung volumes e. g., RV, FRC and TLC cannot be measured by spirometer because they include the volume of the gas left in the lung (i. e., this air cannot come out of the lung, however. forcefully one may expire). Two techniques are commonly used to measure the lung volumes. - Helium dilution method. - Body plethysmography. Helium dilution method In the helium dilution method, the subject repeatedly breathes in and out from a reservoir with a known volume of gas containing a trace amount of helium. The helium is diluted by the gas previously present in the lungs and very little is absorbed into the pulmonary circulation. From knowledge of the reservoir volume and the initial and final helium concentrations, the volume of the gas present in the lungs can he calculated. The helium dilution method may underestimate the volume of gas in lungs if there are slowly communicating airspaces such as bullae. In this situation, lung volumes can be measured more accurately with a body plethysmography a sealed box in which patient sits while panting against a closed mouthpiece. Because there is no airflow into or out of the plethysmography the pressure changes in the thorax during panting cause compression and rarefaction of gas in the lungs and simultaneous rarefaction and compression of gas in the plethysmograph. By measuring the pressure changes in the plethysmograph and at the mouthpiece the volume of gas in the thorax can he calculated using Boyle's law.",

But since vagus nerve is also the motor supply of stomach and the antropyloroduodenal segment a truncal vagotomy leads to gastric stasis. Gastric stasis is prevented by adding a drainage procedure to the truncal vagotomy (Vagotomy & drainage - V+ D). Drainage procedure used are: Gastrojejunostomy Pyloroplasty In Highly selective vagotomy (also known as parietal cell vagotomy or proximal gastric vagotomy) the vagal innervation to the antrum and pylorus (nerves of Latarjet) are preserved, only the vagal supply to the proximal two- thirds of the stomach (where essentially all the parietal cells are located) is cut.

        "exp": "Osteoporosis is a loss of the bone mass. It is impoant to note that the mineralization of the bone is normal. This loss of bone mass means there is an increasing likelihood of fracture with increasing age. Due to the accelerated loss of bone mass following the menopause, elderly women are at a higher risk of osteoporosis than men. There are numerous risk factors for the development of osteoporosis. Among them are Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups, female sex, increasing age, early menopause, smoking, excess alcohol, coicosteroid use, hypogonadism and rheumatoid ahritis. The reduced bone mass of osteoporosis may result in veebral crush fractures, the majority of which are asymptomatic. The extent of osteoporosis is best investigated with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. This gives a T score, which is the number of standard detions the patient's bone mineral density differs from the population average for a young healthy adult. The World Health Organization defines osteoporosis as a T score of -2. 5 or greater (i. e. the bone mineral density of more than 2. 5 standard detion below that of the average for a young healthy adult). A T score of between -1. 5 and -2. 5 is defined as osteopenia. Spinal x-rays (A) are useful to assess veebral crush fractures but cannot assess extent of osteoporosis. Full blood count, bone and liver biochemistry tests (C) are not affected by osteoporosis, making this answer incorrect.
