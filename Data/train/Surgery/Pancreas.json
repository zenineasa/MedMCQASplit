Continuity of the biliary and GI tract is established by performing hepaticojejunostomy, pancreaticojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy (Figure below). The 5-year survival rate is higher for periampullary carcinoma (30%) than that for pancreatic head lesions (10%). Most centers do not give irradiation routinely before or after surgery, because pancreatic cancers do not respond well to radiotherapy. Endoscopically placed stents alone are used only in palliative circumstances in patients with limited life expectancy. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure). A: Preoperative anatomic relationships showing a tumor in the head of the pancreas. B: Postoperative reconstruction showing pancreatic, biliary, and gastric anastomoses. A cholecystectomy and bilateral truncal vagotomy are also part of the procedure. In many cases, the distal stomach and pylorus can be preserved, and vagotomy is then unnecessary",
