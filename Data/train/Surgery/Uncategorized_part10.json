Perform VCUG and renal-bladder ultrasonography in any child with documented UTI before age 5 years, any child with pyelonephritis, and any male child with a symptomatic UTI. A renal-bladder ultrasonography may be used to screen older children with UTI. If ultrasonographic findings are abnormal, conduct fuher workup studies with VCUG to rule out VUR. During the initial workup in a patient with suspected reflux, perform the standard VCUG, which provides clear anatomic detail and allows accurate grading of the reflux degree. By filling and emptying the bladder several times (cycling) with the catheter still in the bladder, as described by Lebowitz, the yield of identifying VUR is clearly enhanced. The conventional cystography provides more anatomical accuracy than nuclear cystography; however, nuclear cystography is advantageous (used widely to monitor VUR) because of lower radiation exposure and increased sensitivity.",

        "question": "Not true about mucinous cystadenoma pancreas?",
        "exp": "Ans is 'a' i.e. Microcystic adenoma Mucinous cystadenoma are macrocystic adenomas. Serous cystadenomas are microcystic adenomas. Cystic neoplasm of Pancreas Cystic neoplasms are of the following types: Common types? a. Serous cystadenomas (approx. 25-30% of all cystic neoplasms) b. Mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas (approx 40-50% of all cystic neoplasms) Uncommon types? c. intraductal papillary mutinous tumor (approx.10% of all cystic neoplasms) solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (about 5-10% of all cystic neoplasms) Serous cystadenomas Serous cystadenomas are benign tumors without malignant potential. (Serous cystadenocarcinoma has been repoed very rarely (<1%) They have a spongy appearance, composed of multiple small cysts (microcystic). May contain central stellate fibrotic scar that may calcify (sunburst calcification) and it is highly specific and considered to be viually pathognomonic of serous cystadenoma. The cyst is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. They do not produce mucin These lesions thus contain thin serous fluid that does not stain positive for mucin and is low in CEA ( Common in females (F:M ratio is 2:1), usually in 7th decade of life. Common in the head/ uncinate process region.(50% in the head/uncinate process, and 50% in the neck, body, or tail) Serous cystadenomas do not have malignant potential, hence operated only when symptomatic. Mucionous cystic neoplasms (cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma) Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) encompass a spectrum ranging from benign but potentially malignant (i.e. cystadenomas) to carcinoma with a very aggressive behavior (i.e. cystadenocarcinomas); suggesting a gradual malignant transformation. MCNs are composed of large thick-walled, septate cysts (macrocystic) with no connection to the ductal system. (difference from IPMN where tumor is connected to the ductal system) The cysts are lined by tall columnar epithelium that fills the cyst with viscous mucin. MCNs are characterised by the presence of ovarian-type stroma which is a key pathologic feature distinguishing these lesions. This stroma is not only morphologically similar to that of the ovarian coex, but also expresses oestrogen and progesterone receptors that are detectable by immunohistochemistry Females are much more commonly affected than males (ratio 9:1), with mean age of 50 years. MCNs predominantly involve the body and tail of the pancreas. High CEA levels in the fluid (>200 ng/mL) may suggest malignant transformation. Resection is the treatment of choice for MCNs as the best way to distinguish the entirely benign form (mucinous cystadenoma) from its malignant counterpa (mucinous cystadenocarcinoma) is pathologic assessment after complete surgical removal. Because most MCNs are located in the body and tail of the pancreas, distal pancreatectomy is the most common treatment. IPMNs IPMNs are similar to MCNs in that they are cystic tumors that secrete mucin. The epithelial lining of the cyst is by tall columnar mucin producing cells that frequently forms papillary projections. Two major differences from MCNs is: - IPMNs extensively involve the main pancreatic ducts or the major side branches (or both); whereas MCNs do not connect to the pancreatic duct system. - IPMNs lack the 'ovarian' stroma seen in MCNs. Mucin production by cells leads to intraductal mucin accumulation and subsequent cystic dilation. This mucin production may be so great that mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater. On ERCP, mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater, a so-called fish-eye lesion, that is viually diagnostic of IPMN Like MCNs IPMNs can range from benign (IPMN adenomas) to malignant (IPMN carcinomas) In contrast to mucinous cystic neoplasms, IPMNs arise more frequently in men than in women, and they involve the head of the pancreas more often than the tail. Age group: seventh to eighth decade of life Surgery is the treatment of choice. Solid- Pseudopapillary tumor Solid-pseudopapillary tumors are rare and typically occur in young women These are well encapsulated, typically large lesions (>10 cm), and may occur anywhere within the pancreas.",

        "question": "If caecum is involved as a pa of the wall of hernial sac and is not its content, then it will be known as: September 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Sliding hernia Indirect inguinal hernia An indirect inguinal hernia follows the tract through the inguinal canal. This results from a persistent process vaginalis. The inguinal canal begins in the intra-abdominal cavity at the internal inguinal ring, located approximately midway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior iliac spine. The canal courses down along the inguinal ligament to the external ring, located medial to the inferior epigastric aeries, subcutaneously and slightly above the pubic tubercle. Contents of this hernia then follow the tract of the testicle down into the scrotal sac. Direct hernia A direct inguinal hernia usually occurs due to a defect or weakness in the transversalis fascia area of the Hesselbach triangle. The triangle is defined inferiorly by the inguinal ligament, laterally by the inferior epigastric aeries, and medially by the conjoined tendon. Femoral hernia The femoral hernia follows the tract below the inguinal ligament through the femoral canal. The canal lies medial to the femoral vein and lateral to the lacunar (Gimbernat) ligament. Because femoral hernias protrude through such a small defined space, they frequently become incarcerated or strangulated. Umbilical hernia The umbilical hernia occurs through the umbilical fibromuscular ring, which usually obliterates by 2 years of age. They are congenital in origin and are repaired if they persist in children older than age 2-4 years. Richter hernia The Richter hernia occurs when only the antimesenteric border of the bowel herniates through the fascial defect. The Richter hernia involves only a poion of the circumference of the bowel. As such, the bowel may not be obstructed, even if the hernia is incarcerated or strangulated, and the patient may not present with vomiting. The Richter hernia can occur with any of the various abdominal hernias and is paicularly dangerous, as a poion of strangulated bowel may be reduced unknowingly into the abdominal cavity, leading to perforation and peritonitis Incisional hernia This iatrogenic hernia occurs in 2-10% of all abdominal operations secondary to breakdown of the fascial closure of prior surgery. Even after repair, recurrence rates approach 20-45%. Spigelian hernia This rare form of abdominal wall hernia occurs through a defect in the spigelian fascia, which is defined by the lateral edge of the rectus muscle at the arcuate line (costal arch to the pubic tubercle). Obturator hernia This hernia passes through the obturator foramen, following the path of the obturator nerves and muscles. Obturator hernias occur with a female-to-male ratio of 6:1, because of a gender-specific larger canal diameter. Because of its anatomic position, this hernia presents more commonly as a bowel obstruction than as a protrusion of bowel contents Sliding hernia As a result of slipping of the posterior parietal peritoneum on the underlying retroperitoneal structures, the posterior wall of the sac is not formed of peritoneum alone, but by the sigmoid colon and its mesentery on the left, the caecum on the right and, sometimes on either side by a poion of the bladder.",

Estrogens also increase osteocyte survival by inhibiting apoptosis. However, the major effect of estrogens is to decrease the number and activity of osteoclasts. Much of the action of estrogens on osteoclasts appears to be mediated by altering cytokine (both paracrine and autocrine) signals from osteoblasts. Estrogens decrease osteoblast and stromal cell production of the osteoclast-stimulating cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and increase the production of IGF-1, bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-6, and transforming growth factor (TGF) Beta which are antiresorptive.

Signs and symptoms Tiredness (a non-specific symptom often present in liver disease) Severe jaundice with intense itching. Malabsorption (especially of fat) and steatorrhea, leading to decreased levels of the fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E and K. Signs of cirrhosis Ascending cholangitis? The diagnosis is by imaging of the bile duct, usually in the setting of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which shows characteristic changes (\"beading\") of the bile ducts. Another option is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The differential diagnosis can include primary biliary cirrhosis, drug induced cholestasis, cholangiocarcinoma, and HIV-associated cholangiopathy. PSC is often listed as a manifestation of ulcerative colitis outside the colon. PSC differs from these manifestations in that, unlike most other manifestations, PSC continues in spite of surgical removal of the colon. Standard treatment includes ursodiol. Treatment also includes medication to relieve itching (antipruritics) and bile acid sequesterants (cholestyramine) etc.",

The combination of hypercalcemia and acute renal failure raises the possibility of multiple myeloma as the bone breakdown secondary to tumor involvement releases large amounts of calcium to the extracellular fluid and hypercalcemia ensues. The renal failure in myeloma is primarily related to hypercalcemia combined with proteinaceous cast formation within the renal tubules, producing a form of intratubu- lar obstruction as well as a tubular inflammatory lesion. The major diagnostic clue is the finding of dipstick mildly positive urine with a sulfosalicylic acid strongly positive urine. Dipstick testing does not detect the negatively charged light-chain proteins, only the alburnin. Renovascular lesions and thrombotic renal disease could present with this picture, although they should not be asso- ciated with hypercalcemia and severe back pain, and findings upon examination of the urine would not include proteins.

C: Excellent prognosisPapillary carcinoma is a relatively common well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma.Despite its well-differentiated characteristics, papillary carcinoma may be ovely or minimally invasive. In fact, these tumors may spread easily to other organs. Papillary tumors have a propensity to invade lymphatics but are less likely to invade blood vessels.Papillary carcinoma appears as an irregular solid or cystic mass in a normal thyroid parenchyma. They are very seldom encapsulatedThyroid cancers are more often found in patients with a history of low- or high-dose external irradiation. Papillary tumors of the thyroid are the most common form of thyroid cancer to result from exposure to radiation.The life expectancy of patients with this cancer is related to their age. The prognosis is better for younger patients than for patients who are older than 45 years of patients with papillary cancers, about 11% present with metastases outside the neck and mediastinum.FNAB is considered the best first-line diagnostic procedure for a thyroid nodule; FNAB is a safe and minimally invasive procedure.Surgery is the definitive management of thyroid cancer, and various types of operations may be performed.Lobectomy with isthmectomySubtotal thyroidectomyThis is a near-total thyroidectomyPatients younger than 40 years who have papillary thyroid carcinoma nodules that are smaller than 1 cm, well-defined, minimally invasive, and isolated may be treated with hemithyroidectomy and isthmectomyTotal thyroidectomyPerform a total thyroidectomy (removal of all thyroid tissue but preserving the contralateral parathyroid glands) in patients who are older than 40 years with papillary carcinoma and in any patient with bilateral disease Compared with most cancers the prognosis in differentiated thyroid carcinoma is excellent.",

Bile leakage presents themselves in the postoperative period by pain and fever, with or without abnormal liver function tests and jaundice. Other manifestations include external discharge of bile through the drain or surgical incision or biliary peritonitis or biloma or cholangitis. Initial investigation of these patients includes U/S or CT (preferably CT) for detection of any fluid collection. Any biliary collection or subhepatic abscess should be promptly drained. Minor collection, after percutaneous drainage, needs no fuher treatment, if the patient improves. However, in the presence of any major leak, jaundice, signs of cholangitis, the patient should be investigated with an ERC (or PTC) to establish the presence, extent and severity of bile duct injury. Management of Cystic duct bile leaks are usually due to slipping of ligature or clip. can be managed by endoscopic sphincterotomy and stenting (the principle behind is that if the bile is allowed to flow through the normal tract, any fistulous communication would heal spontaneously) The above mentioned management of cystic duct leak is given in Sabiston; Blumga's Surgery of the liver and biliary tract; Textbook of Liver & biliary, surgery by William C Meyer and in Maingot's abdominal operations. But Maingot adds ? \"However in patients who develop this complication after laproscopic surgery, the author ours relaparoscopy with suction of extravasated bile and ligature of the cystic duct stump by a catgut endoloop. A laproscopic approach appears to be more direct and definitive and avoids the risk, albeit small of endoscopic sphincterotomy and stenting.\" Management of bile duct injuries the basic approach is biliary decompression, either by endoscopic sphincterotomy & stenting or by transhepatic catheters Some fistulas may close spontaneously by biliary decompression - For the major injuries (like complete transection of CBD or hepatic ducts) not responding, definitive repair is done. But definitive repair is delayed 6 to 8 weeks until acute inflammation has resolved. Definitive repair includes - Roux-en-V choledochojejunostomy or - hepaticojejunostomy All patients with biliary leak should be well nourished and kept free of infection. Also know the management, if bile duct injury is recognized at the time of cholecystectomy. Management of the Bile Duct Injury Recognized at the Time of Cholecystectomy A small, non-cautery-based paial lateral bile duct injury 4 can be managed with placement of a T tube. If the biliary injury is more extensive, or if there is significant thermal damage owing to cautery-based trauma, or if the injury involves more than 50% of the circumference of the bile duct wall 4 an end-to-side choledochojejunostomy with a Roux-en-Y loop of jejunum should be performed. Injury to isolated hepatic ducts smaller than 3 mm or those draining a single hepatic segment 4 can be safely ligated.",

Approximately 5 to 7% of carotid body tumors are malignant. The risk of malignancy is greatest in young patients with familial tumors. Clinical features Usually unilateral* Present most commonly in the 5th decade* and approximately 10% have family history. The pt. often presents with a long history of several years of a slowly enlarging painless lump* at the carotid bifurcation.

A bruit may also be present. Investigation Doppler study Carotid angiogram FNAC & biopsy are Ca Treatment Because these tumors rarely metastasize and their overall rate of growth is slow, the need for surgical removal must be considered carefully as complication of surgery are potentially serious. The operation is best avoided in elderly patients. Schwaz 8/e writes - \"The treatment of choice of carotid body tumors is surgical excision.

The clinical symptoms are because of the effects of hypoglycaemia (sweating, tremor, palpitations, confusion, headache, disorientation, visual difficulties, irrational behavior, or even coma) The diagnosis of insulinoma requires the demonstration of an elevated plasma insulin level at the time of hypoglycemia. This is because insulinomas do not reduce the secretion of insulin in the presence of hypoglycaemia. Whereas in a normal person, insulin levels would decrease with decrease in blood glucose levels. The most reliable test to diagnose insulinoma is a fast up to 72 h with serum glucose, and insulin measurements every 4-8 h. The test is terminated if the the patient becomes symptomatic or glucose levels are <40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L). Diagnosis of insulinoma is made if: - A serum insulin level of 6 microunit/mL or more in the presence of blood glucose values below 40 mg/dL - ratio of plasma insulin to glucose is > 0.3 In addition to the above criteria, some other measurements are also required before making the diagnosis of insulinoma - C-peptide level - serum proinsulin level, - serum sulfonylurea levels These additional tests are used because any hidden use of insulin or oral hypoglycemics taken by the patient would resemble insulinoma causing high levels of insulin in presence of hypoglycaemia. The combination of elevated proinsulin levels (normal in exogenous insulin/hypoglycemic agent users), elevated C-peptide levels (low in exogenous insulin users), antibodies to insulin (positive in exogenous insulin users), and measurement of sulfonylurea levels in serum or plasma will allow the correct diagnosis to be made.",

Veebroplasty and kvphoplasty Veebroplasty and kyphoplasty are interventional radiologic procedures for the treatment of the intense pain refractory to medical management or bracing caused by veebral compression fracture associated with osteoporosis, tumors, and trauma. Veebroplasty and kyphoplasty involve intraosseous injection of acrylic cementpolymethyl methacrylate under local anesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance. Pain reduction or elimination is immediate, and the risk of complications is low. Neither veebroplasty nor kyphoplasty are intended for the treatment of interveebral disc disease or ahritis. Veebroplasty may also be applied prophylactically to an at-risk veebra between 2 other abnormal veebrae. Veebroplasty does not restore the height of the compressed veebral body. A related procedure, kyphoplasty, is intended to restore lost height by inflating a balloon pump within and between the fracture fragments prior to the infusion of the cement. Both procedures result in similar relief of pain due to veebral compression fractures. The risks of the procedure are low and include extravasation of cement into the epidural space causing myelopathy, or fatal pulmonary embolism from extension of cement into paraspinous veins. Indications for percutaneous veebroplasty Osteoporotic veebral compression fractures more than two weeks old in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine causing moderate to severe pain and unresponsive to conservative therapy. Painful metastasis and multiple myeloma with or without adjuvant radiation or surgical therapy. Painful veebral hemangiomas Veebral osteonecrosis. Reinforcement of a pathologically weak veebral body before a surgical stabilization procedure. Contraindication for percutaneous veebroplasty Contraindications are : - 1. Absolute Osteoporotic veebral fracture that is completely healed or is clearly responding to conservative management. Presence of untreated coagulopathy. Presence of discitis/osteomyelitis (septic or tubercular) or sepsis. 2. Relative Significant compromise of the spinal canal by retropulsed bone fragment or tumor. Fracture older than one year. Greater than 80-90% collapse of the veebral body.",

Patients on parenteral hyperalimentation with extensive burns, sepsis, major operations, multiple trauma or prolonged illness with multiple organ system failure are at risk for developing acalculous cholecystitis.* Harrison writes* \"An increased risk for the development of acalculous cholecystitis is especially associated with serious trauma or burns, with the postpaum period following prolonged labor, and with ohopedic and other nonbiliary major surgical operations in the post operative period. It may possibly complicate periods of prolonged parenteral hyperalimentation. For some of these cases, biliary sludge in the cystic duct may be responsible. Other precipitating factors include- vasculitis- obstructing adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder- diabetes mellitus- torsion of the gall bladder- unusual bacterial infections of the gall bladder (eg. Leptospira, Streptococcus, Salmonella, or Vibrio cholera), andparasitic infestation of gallbladder.* Acalculous cholecystitis may also be seen with a variety of other systemic disease processes- sarcoidosis - syphilis- cardiovascular disease - actinomycosis- tuberculosis* Clinical manifestation- is indistinguishable from those of calculuos cholecystitis, however, the setting of cholecystitis in severe underlying illness is characteristic of acalculous cholecystitis.* U/S & CT examinations show a large, tense, static gallbladder without stones and with evidence of poor emptying over a prolonged period. Ultrasonography is usually the diagnostic test of choice, as it can be done bedside in the intensive care unit.* ManagementThe complication rate of acalculous cholecystitis is more than calculous cholecystitis.- Acalculous cholecystitis requires urgent intervention.- Percutaneous ultrasound or CT guided cholecystostomy is the treatment of choice for these patients, as they are unfit for surgery.- If the diagnosis is unceain, percutaneous cholecystostomy is both diagnostic and therapeutic. About 90% of patients will improve with the percutaneous cholecystostomy. However, if they do not improve, other steps, such as open cholecystostomy or cholecystectomy, may be required.If needed cholecystectomy can be done after the patient has recovered from the underlying disease.",

This type does not occur in the same joints on both sides of the body and usually only involves fewer than 3 joints. Symmetric: This type accounts for around 25% of cases, and affects joints on both sides of the body simultaneously. This type is most similar to rheumatoid ahritis and is disabling in around 50% of all cases. Ahritis mutilans: Affects less than 5% of patients and is a severe, deforming and destructive ahritis. This condition can progress over months or years causing severe joint damage. Ahritis mutilans has also be called chronic absorptive ahritis, and may be seen in rheumatoid ahritis as well. Spondylitis: This type is characterised by stiffness of the spine or neck, but can also affect the hands and feet, in a similar fashion to symmetric ahritis.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' ie. Excision biopsy of the node Pts age and history of chronic smoking & hoarseness are pointing towards laryngeal cancer & lung cancer (lung cancer can cause hoarseness of voice by involving the recurrent laryngeal nerve). But laryngeal cancer does not drain to supraclavicular lymph node. So no need of doing a laryngoscopy. Supraclavicular lymph node drains from following areas ? a Retroperitoneal space d testis b Lung e ovaries c breasts f GIT. An enlarged supraclavicular lymph node is always abnormal, so whenever we find one we do an excisional biopsy to know the histology (it would point towards the primary cause). Harrison writes - \" The indications for lymph node biopsy are imprecise yet it is a valuable diagnostic tool. The decision to biopsy may be made early in a pts. evaluation or delyayed for upto 2 weeks. Prompt biopsy should occur if the pts. history and physical finding suggest a malignancy, examples include a solitary hard, nontender, cervical node in an older pt. who is a chronic user of tobacco; Supraclavicular adenopathy and solitary or generalized denopathy that is firm, movable and suggestive of lymphoma.\"",

        "exp": "This is a case of trigger finger, which is most common in is most common in the sixth decade, women, people with diabetes, and the dominant hand. Trigger finger is caused by inflammation and constriction of the retinacular sheath through which the flexor tendons run as they pass from the palm of the hand into the finger. This causes irritation of the tendon, sometimes resulting in the formation of a nodule, which impinges on the pulley, causing pain and restricting movement. Treatment: Coicosteroid injection into the tendon sheath is usually the first line treatment. Up to 57% of cases resolve with one injection, and 86% with two. Surgery--Usually indicated if two coicosteroid injections six weeks apa have failed, or the finger is irreversibly locked in flexion. Surgery to release the pulley is done as a day case through a palmar incision under local anaesthetic. Cure rates approach 100%. Splinting for six weeks can decrease inflammation. This is an option for those wishing to avoid injections or surgery. Congenital triggering usually presents in the first year of life. The digit is locked in flexion or extension. Steroid injections have no role in management; instead, refer to a hand surgeon. Ref: Benson L, Ptaszek A. Injection versus surgery in the treatment of trigger finger.

        "exp": "USG guided aspiration of hip There are two very common causes of an acute hip/groin pain, which commonly are very challenging to diagnose: septic ahritis and transient synovitis. Septic ahritis and transient synovitis are completely unrelated, although both might manifest with hip pain, restricted range of movement of the hip. Differentiating between these two is vital, because while transient synovitis is a benign self-limiting disorder, the septic ahritis if untreated is catastrophic with permanent damage to the hip. Treatment for septic ahritis and for transient synovitis is entirely different. While transient synovitis can be managed by observation and anti-inflammatory agents; septic ahritis needs aggressive management with intravenous antibiotics with or without surgical debridement. Lets, first see the two conditions and the differences between them: Transient synovitis (also k/a toxic synovitis, observation hip. irritable hip) Its a self-limiting, inflammatory condition of the synovium, that lasts only a sho time (therefore k/a transient) Its the most CO/11111On cause of hip pain and limp in children under 10 yrs of age. Although the cause of transient synovitis is unclear, evidence suggests it is associated with immune responses to viral or bacterial antigens, mediated through the synol membrane. Synol fluid rapidly accumulates under pressure in the hip joint, and there may be severe pain from capsular distension. The fluid is resorbed within 3-7 days, with no long term sequelae. Presentation is with hip pain or limp. Hip can be held in flexion, abduction and external rotation depending on the degree of effusion. Physical examination is characterized by guarded rotation of the hip joint. Pain can usually be elicited at the extremes of motion, especially abduction and medial rotation. The ESR and C-reactive protein are usually normal but may be mildly elevated. The WBC count is generally normal with a normal differential. Rest is the primary method of treatment (thus it's also k/a observation hip). In most patients the symptoms resolve in 3 to 7 days. Differentiation from septic ahritis: The very impoant distinction between transient synovitis and septic ahritis is in the first instance clinical. The patient with transient synovitis is not sick, appears cheerful and healthy and, if there is fever, it is usually of a low-grade nature. Whereas a child with septic process is seriously ill, with high grade fever. Pain is severe and the patient is unable to bear weight. A patient of transient synovitis may be able to walk with a limp, however depending on the extent of effusion the pain in transient synovitis may also be severe enough as to render the child incapable of walking. In septic ahritis, WBC count, ESR and C-reactive protein are significantly raised. U/S may show joint fluid in both the conditions. \"Within the past 5 years three excellent papers have been published that help differentiate between benign, transient synovitis and the potentially dangerous septic ahritis. In the two studies by Kocher et al - A history of fever, together with - Non-Weight bearing, and - ESR higher than 40 mm, and - A serum WBC count higher than 12000 cells/mm3 all pointed clearly toward septic ahritis. The probability of having septic ahritis with all four predictor was 99.6%. However, in a study Luhmann et al the probability was only 59% with all four predictors. They found that a history of fever, a WBC> 12000. and a previous health care visit yielded a 71% probability of septic ahritis. \"Current diagnosis & treatment in spos medicine By Patrick J. McMahon 1/e p210 Now lets come to the question. Here we see that the information supplied is insufficient. ESR is raised but how much, its not given. The WBC count is normal, so we can think in lines of Transient synovitis, but Turek ohopaedics writes about septic ahritis- \"The peripheral WBC count is usually elevated, as is the sedimentation rate, although the diagnosis of septic ahritis should not be excluded simply on the basis of normal values for these two studies.\" So here the diagnosis is unceain. Thus we will proceed with usg guided aspiration of the hip as the next line of management. \"Aspiration of the joint must be done when the diagnosis is unceain.\"- Turek Ohopaedics \"Joint aspiration is mandatory for fluid analysis and culture of the synol fluid in cases of septic ahritis.: \" - T14rek ohopaedics",

Surgical Pathology & Cytopathology writes - \"There may be crypt architectural distortion and branching similar to that evident in idiopathic irritable bowel syndrome (IBD), but without the dense lamina propria inflammation\".\nSolitary Rectal Ulcer Syndrome\n\nThe pathogenesis of mucosal prolapse syndrome or solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is unclear. It has been postulated that there is a dysfunction of the neuromuscular control of defecation. This necessitates an increase in intraabdominal pressure to achieve expulsion of the stool. The pressure then forces a rectal mucosal fold to prolapse into the anal canal. Localized ischemia of the prolapsed mucosa as a result of local vascular compromise then produces the characteristic histological change of SRUS.\nSRUS affects both sexes, over a wide range, but is most common in women 20-40 years of age.\nMost lesions occur on the anterior or anterolateral rectal wall, but SRUS may involve the bowel anywhere from the sigmoid to the anorectal junction.\nDespite the designation solitary rectal ulcer, in 10 to 15% of cases multiple ulcers may be present within a single patch of diseased mucosa.\nEndoscopically only about half of the patients with SRUS have an actual ulcer. The remaining patients have an area of mucosal erythema, mucosal nodules, or frank polyps, which may or may not have surface ulceration.\nThe histological features can be correlated to the underlying pathogenesis of the disorder. Prolapsed mucosa becomes ischemic due to compression of the vascular supply, particularly the small veins. This leads to detachment of the surface epithelium and withering of the superficial portion of the crypts, similar to ischemia from any cause. Since the prolapse is typically intermittent, during intervals of normal blood flow regrowth of the mucosa is stimulated, resulting in mucosal hyperplasia due to elongation of the crypts. As an additional response to the ischemic injury, fibrosis of the lamina propria occurs. There may be crypt architectural distortion and branching similar to that evident in idiopathic irritable bowel syndrome, but without the dense lamina propria inflammation. The muscularis mucosa also becomes thickened and disorganized and tongues of muscle extend upwards from the muscularis mucosa to the surface epithelium.\nIn some cases the ischemia is severe enough to lead to erosion or ulceration, often with a scanty overlying pseudo membrane.

It is often associated with a Banka lesion of the glenoid (stripping of the glenoidal labrum along with the periosteum from the anterior surface of the glenoid and scapular neck). Plain film Best seen following re-location of the joint, and better appreciated on internal rotation views. It appears as a sclerotic veical line running from the top of the humeral head towards the shaft. If large then a wedge defect may be evident. CT and MRI Both MRI and CT are very sensitive to this lesion, which appears as a region of flattening or a wedge shaped defect (with bone marrow oedema on MRI acutely) seen involving the posterolateral humeral head above the level of the coracoid. This is usually seen in the most superior few slices, were the humeral head should be rounded. It is impoant to note that below the level of the coracoid the humeral head normally flattens out posterolaterally, and this should not be misinterpreted as a Hill-Sachs lesion",

Aeriography would help identify major aerial and parenchymal injuries.Aerial thrombosis and avulsion of the renal pedicle are best diagnosed by aeriography. Also know: Best imaging study to detect and stage renal and retroperitoneal injuries is - computed tomography with contrast media. It can define the size and extent of the retroperitoneal hematoma, renal lacerations, urinary extravasation, and renal aerial and venous injuries; additionally, it can detect other intra-abdominal injuries. Management: Blunt injuries--Minor renal injuries from blunt trauma account for 85% of cases and do not usually require operation. Bleeding stops spontaneously with bed rest and hydration. Cases in which operation is indicated include those associated with persistent retroperitoneal bleeding, urinary extravasation, evidence of nonble renal parenchyma, and renal pedicle injuries (less than 5% of all renal injuries). Aggressive preoperative staging allows complete definition of injury before operation. Penetrating injuries--Penetrating injuries should be surgically explored. A rare exception to this rule is when staging has been complete and only minor parenchymal injury, with no urinary extravasation, is noted. In 80% of cases of penetrating injury, associated organ injury requires operation; thus, renal exploration is only an extension of this procedure. In the above question, the patient had non pulsatile hematoma. A pulsatile or expanding hematoma is an indication for surgical exploration.",

D: Hypeonia The history in patients with rickets may include the following: Generalized muscular hypotonia of an unknown mechanism is observed in most patients with clinical (as opposed to biochemical and radiographic) signs of rickets. Craniotabes manifests early in infants with vitamin D deficiency, although this feature may be normal in infants, especially for those born prematurely. If rickets occurs at a later age, thickening of the skull develops. This produces frontal bossing and delays the closure of the anterior fontanelle. In the long bones, laying down of uncalcified osteoid at the metaphases leads to spreading of those areas, producing knobby deformity, which is visualized on radiography as cupping and flaring of the metaphyses. Weight bearing produces deformities such as bowlegs and knock-knees. In the chest, knobby deformities results in the rachitic rosary along the costochondral junctions. The weakened ribs pulled by muscles also produce flaring over the diaphragm, which is known as Harrison groove. The sternum may be pulled into a pigeon-breast deformity. In more severe instances in children older than 2 years, veebral softening leads to kyphoscoliosis. The ends of the long bones demonstrate that same knobby thickening. At the ankle, palpation of the tibial malleolus gives the impression of a double epiphysis (Marfan sign). Because the softened long bones may bend, they may fracture one side of the coex (i.e., greenstick fracture).",

It functions as a side-to-side portocaval shunt.\nA catheter is introduced through the jugular vein and, under radiologic control, positioned in the hepatic vein. From this point, the portal vein is assessed through the liver, the tract is dilated, and the channel is kept open by inserting an expandable metal stent, which is left in place.\nTIPS is of great value in controlling refractory variceal bleeding due to portal hypertension.\nIts major disadvantage is restenosis over a period of months, requiring revision or a second TIPS operation.\nDue to restenosis, TIPS is used only for short-term portal decompression - Thus TIPS serves a useful role as a 'bridge' for those patients with end stage liver disease awaiting transplantation i.e. the patient is protected from bleeding in the interim period when the things get ready for transplantation.\nAnother group of patients in whom TIPS may be advantageous include those with advanced hepatic functional decompensation who are unlikely to survive long enough for the TIPS to malfunction.\nTIPS is also effective in medically intractable ascites and Budd-Chiari syndrome.",

The radius revolves on the ulna about an axis which passes through the centre of the head of the radius above and the styloid process of the ulna below, which line if prolonged would pass through the ring finger. In pronation, the hand lies with the palm down and the radius is crossed diagonally over the ulna; the bones are close together. In supination the hand lies with the palm up, the bones lie parallel to one another and widely separated. In the mid-position the radius lies above the ulna and the space between them is at its maximum. The head of the radius rotates in the orbicular ligament, the lower end of the radius revolves around the head of the ulna and rests on the interaicular triangular fibrocailage. The radius is pronated by the pronator teres and pronator quadratus muscles. It is supinated by the brachioradialis, supinator (brevis), and biceps muscles. Some of the other muscles also aid slightly in these movements, especially the flexor carpi radialis in pronation. In fractures the preservation of the interosseous space is essential for the proper performance of pronation and supination.",

        "exp": "Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder in which circulating acetylcholine receptor- binding antibodies are found in approximately 90% of cases, less commonly, when the patient demonstrates isolated eye disease. Other nonspecific evidence of autoimmune disease includes elevated ANAs, presence of abnormal immune complexes, and an association with the hypothyroidism related to lymphocytic thyroiditis, also an autoimmune disorder. The earliest signs of myasthenia gravis are ptosis and weakness of the extraocular muscles, followed by dysphagia and facial muscle weakness. The distinguishing hallmark of this disease is rapid fatiguing of the involved muscles. The conduction velocity of the motor nerve is normal in this condition. When the involved muscle is repetitively stimulated for diagnostic purposes, the EMG shows a decremental response, which can be reversed by the administration of cholinesterase inhibitors. In older children this test is accomplished with edrophonium chloride, but it should be avoided in young infants, as cardiac arrhythmias may result (neostigmine would be used instead). Cholinesterase inhibitors are the primary therapeutic agents, and intramuscular neostigmine methylsulfate, oral neostigmine bromide, and oral pyridostigmine are available. Other therapeutic modalities for myasthenia gravis include immunosuppression, plasmapheresis, thymectomy (an enlarged thymus is frequently seen on chest x-ray), and treatment of hypothyroidism.

        "exp": "Insulin + glucose [Ref : Harrison 17/e p. 2841 Tall T waves on ECG indicate cardiac manifestation of hyperkalemia. - Intravenous calcium gluconate is the first drug to be administered in a patient with hyperkalemia having E.C.G. abnormalities. - It stabilizes the myocardium immediately. - It acts within minutes and is characterized by improvement an impoant in point E.C. to G. note appearance. But - It does not affect transcellular movement of potassium. Thus it won't help in reducing the hyperkalemia. Among the agents which cause transcellular (intracellular) movement of potassium. - \"Intravenous insulin is the fastest wav to lower serum potassium levels\". The goals of the therapy for the tit of acute hyperkalemia in chronological order are as follows:? i) Antagonize the affect of IC on excitable cell membranes ii) Redistribution of extracellular potassium into cells iii) Enhance elimination of potassium. from the body i) Antagonize the effect of potassium on excitable cell membrane Calcium directly antagonizes the myocardial effect of hyperkalemia. It does so by reducing the threshold potential of cardiac myocytes. Calcium for injection is available as chloride or gluconate salt. The preferred agent is the gluconate salt since it is less likely than calcium chloride to cause tissue necrosis. The onset of action is < 3 minutes. The duration of action is 30-60 minutes during which time fuher measures may be undeaken to lower pK. ii) Redistribution of potassium into cells :? Insulin Insulin shifts potassium into cells. Potassium shift inside the cells is mediated by Na+ ATPase. I.V. insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium level Q. The onset of action is < 15 minutes and the effect is maximal b/w 30-60 minutes. Dextrose is given along with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. It was believed that administration of dextrose alone, can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin release. The administration of hypeonic dextrose alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasons:- Endogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for a therapeutic effect. - There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypeonicity. ftadrenoceptor agonists These drugs can also cause movement of potassium inside the cell. High dose albuterol shows their effect in 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours. The effect of insulin is additive with that of albuterol. Patients taking nonselective 13 adrenoceptor blockers will be unlikely to manifest the hypokalemic effects of albuterol. - Even among patients not taking fi blockers as many as 40% seem to he resistant to the hypokalemic effect of albuterol. - The mechanism .for this resistance is unknown and currently, there is no basis for predicting which patients will respond. - For this reason albuterol should never be used as a single agent for the treatment of urgent hyperkalemia. Bicarbonate Bicarbonate (as a bolus injection) was used in the emergency t/t of hyperkalemia. Ironically this dogma was based on studies using a prolonged (4-6 hrs) infusion of bicarbonate. It has now been demonstrated that sho term bicarbonate infusion does not reduce pK in patients with dialysis dependent kidney failure, implying that it does not cause IC+ shift into cells. Sodium bicarbonate seems to have no effect to shift IC+ into cells even after several hours. It is likely to be effective especially in combination with a diuretic drug in enhancing urinary r elimination in patients with some kidney function, although it use .for this purpose has not been evaluated. iii) Elimination of potassium from the body Hyperkalemia occurs most often in patients with renal insufficiency. - However renal potassium excretion may be enhanced even in patients with significant renal impairment by increasing the delivery of solute to the distal nephron. Sodium bicarbonate A sodium bicarbonate infusion administered during 4-6 hrs at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine may enhance urinary K+ excretion and would be desirable especially in patients with metabolic acidosis. The risk of volume expansion with the bicarbonate infusion can he mitigated by use of loop acting diuretics which would, be likely to enhance the kaliuresis. Exchange resin Sodium poly.vterene sulfonate is a cation exchange resin. In the lumen of intestine it exchanges sodium for secreted potassium. Most of this exchange takes place in the colon, the site of most potassium secretion in the gut. There are two concerns with the use of resin in the tit of urgent hyperkalemia The first is its slow effect - When given orally. the onset of action is at least 2 hrs and the maximum effect may not be seen .for more than 6 hrs. The second is its adverse effect - It can cause intestinal necrosis Dialysis -\"llemodialysis is the method of choice for removing potassium from the body\". - The rate of potassium removed with peritoneal dialysis is much slower than with hetnodialysis.",

The symptoms are produced due to excessive secretion of insulin causing hypoglycemia Most of the insulinomas are solitary and benign, Only about 10-15% of insulinomas are malignant. (keep in mind that all other endocrine tumours of pancreas are usually malignant). Symptoms of insulinoma ? - The most common symptom is due to the effect of hypoglycemia on the central nervous system. - These symptoms are - confusion, disorientation, visual difficulties, irrational behaviour, coma Other symptoms are due to increased secretion of catecholamines which includes sweating, tremor and palpitations. Classic diagnostic criteria is - Whipple's triad - Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia during fasting. - Blood glucose below 2.8 mmol/L (50mg/d1) during symptomatic episodes. - Relief of symptoms by intravenous administration of Glucose. The most useful diagnostic test and the only one indicated in almost all patients is demonstration of fasting hypoglycemia in the presence of inappropriately high level of insulin. - The patient is fasted for 72 hrs or till the symptoms of hypoglycemia develop. - When hypoglycemia develops, serum level of insulin is measured. A ratio of plasma insulin to glucose > 0.3 is diagnostic. Localization of the tumour Once the diagnosis has been made, localization of the tumour is must for surgery. The most impoant examination for localization of tumour is intraoperative ultrasound, which can indentify pancreatic tumour in all cases. It is more sensitive than any other method Other impoant methods of localization ? High resolution CT and MRI. Endoscopic ultrasound examination of pancreas. - Selective aeriography T/T - Surgical excision is the t/t of choice ? - Since most insulinomas are benign simple enucleation is done.",

Despite its well-differentiated characteristics, papillary carcinoma may be ovely or minimally invasive. In fact, these tumors may spread easily to other organs. Papillary tumors have a propensity to invade lymphatics but are less likely to invade blood vessels. Papillary carcinoma appears as an irregular solid or cystic mass in a normal thyroid parenchyma. They are very seldom encapsulated Thyroid cancers are more often found in patients with a history of low- or high-dose external irradiation. Papillary tumors of the thyroid are the most common form of thyroid cancer to result from exposure to radiation. The life expectancy of patients with this cancer is related to their age. The prognosis is better for younger patients than for patients who are older than 45 years of patients with papillary cancers, about 11% present with metastases outside the neck and mediastinum. FNAB is considered the best first-line diagnostic procedure for a thyroid nodule; FNAB is a safe and minimally invasive procedure. Surgery is the definitive management of thyroid cancer, and various types of operations may be performed. Lobectomy with isthmectomy Subtotal thyroidectomy This is a near-total thyroidectomyPatients younger than 40 years who have papillary thyroid carcinoma nodules that are smaller than 1 cm, well-defined, minimally invasive, and isolated may be treated with hemithyroidectomy and isthmectomy Total thyroidectomy Perform a total thyroidectomy (removal of all thyroid tissue but preserving the contralateral parathyroid glands) in patients who are older than 40 years with papillary carcinoma and in any patient with bilateral disease Compared with most cancers the prognosis in differentiated thyroid carcinoma is excellent.",

On the other hand heparin induced thrombocytopenia is strongly associated with thrombosis which frequently leads to diagnosis of heparin induced thrombocytopenia\". -Thrombosis in heparin induced thrombocytopenia is associated with a moality of approximately 20-30% with an equal percentage of patients becoming permanently disabled by amputation, stroke or other causes. - Thromboembolic complications can be venous, aerial both and include deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism myocardial infarction, thrombotic stroke and occlusion of limb aeries. The mechanism underlying heparin induced thrombocytopenia is an immune response. The principal antigen is a complex of heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4).

As a result, the treatment of choledochal cyst is surgical excision followed by biliary enteric reconstruction. There is no role for internal drainage by cystenterostomy, which leaves the cyst wall intact and leads to the inevitable development of cholangitis. Rarely, choledachal cyst can lead to the development of biliary tract malignancy. This provides a fuher rationale for complete cyst excision.\" Thus we infer that a bypass procedure will inevitably lead to strictures and recurrent cholangitis. This can be prevented by complete excision of cyst and reconstruction procedure. Though by complete excision we also prevent malignancy (which may occur in future), but this is an added advantage",

The most common cause of chronic granulomatous disease is defective NADPH oxidase, which is an enzyme on the membrane of lysosomes that conves O2 to superoxide and stimulates oxygen burst. This deficiency results in recurrent infections with catalasepositive organisms, such as S. aureus. The classic form of chronic granulomatous disease usually affects boys and causes death before the age of 10. Key findings in chronic granulomatous disease include lymphadenitis, hepatosplenomegaly, eczematoid dermatitis, pulmonary infiltrates that are associated with hypergammaglobulinemia, and defective ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria. A defect in the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) is seen in the autosomal recessive (Swiss) form of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID), while a defect in the IL-2 receptor is seen in the X-linked recessive form of SCID.

This finding is known as the silk sign and is highly suggestive of an inguinal hernia. The silk sign is paicularly impoant in young children and infants, in whom palpation of the external inguinal ring and inguinal canal is difficult because the patients' small size.Operation is the treatment of choice.The basic operation is inguinal herniotomy, which entails dissecting out and opening the hernia sac, reducing any contents and then transfixing the neck of the sac and removing the remainder.",

This results in functional neurological defecit that exceeds the actual tissue disruption. This condition is refered to as spinal shock. The presence of spinal shock causes the absence of all reflexesQ. And it typically lasts upto 24- 48 hours after the injuryQ. The bulbocavernosus reflex is the reflex that returns first, thus marking the end of spinal shockQ. This point has prognostic impoance because recovery from a complete neurological deficit that is still present at the end of spinal shock is extremely unlikely. In other words, a total absence of sensation & voluntary motor functions caudal to the level of spinal cord injury in the absence of spinal shock (i.e. bulbocavernosus reflex has recovered) is indicative of complete spinal cord injury and there is viually no likelihood of functional spinal cord recovery.",

        "question": "Most radiosensitive testicular tumour is: March 2008",

A: Seminoma Tumours of the testis are classified according to their predominant cellular types: Seminoma (40%) Teratomas (32%) subdivided into: - Teratoma differentiated - Malignant teratoma intermediate - Malignant teratoma undifferentiated - Malignant teratoma trophoblastic (choriocarcinoma is the most lethal form and it is the least common at 1% of the non-seminomatous type) Combined seminoma and teratoma (14%) Interstitial tumours (1.5%) Risk factors include: Cryptorchidism or testicular maldescent. Klinefelter's syndrome. Family history. Male infeility (increases risk by a factor of three). Low bih weight, young maternal age, young paternal age, multiparity, breech delivery. Infantile hernia. Height - taller men are more at risk of developing germ cell tumours. Testicular microlithiasis (small intratesticular calcifications seen on ultrasound). Diagnosis is usually confirmed by ultrasound. Tissue histology can follow an inguinal orchidectomy. Disease can be staged by thoraco-abdominal CT scanning. Tumour markers are useful in staging and assessing response to treatment. Alpha-fetoprotein is produced by yolk sac elements but not produced by seminomas. Beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin is produced by trophoblastic elements and so may be elevated levels in both teratomas and seminomas. LDH should be measured. Tumour markers are present in 75% of teratomas. Royal Marsden staging of testicular tumours: Stage I - disease confined to the testis. Stage IM - as Stage I but with tumour markers rising after operation. Stage II - para-aoic lymph node involvement with fuher division into Stage IIA with nodes5 cm in diameter. Stage III - the disease has spread above the diaphragm with fuher subdivision into A, B and C as for Stage II. Stage IV - extra lymphatic metastases. - Stage L1 - - Stage L2 - >3 lung metastases but all Stage L3 - >3 lung metastases with 1 or more >2 cm in diameter. Stage H+ - liver metastases.
