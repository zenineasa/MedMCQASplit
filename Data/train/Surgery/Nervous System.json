        "exp": "Ans. a (Middle meningeal artery). (Ref: B & L, Surgery, 25th/ 303). Extradural haematoma (EDH)# It is a neurosurgical emergency. An EDH is nearly always associated with a skull fracture and is more common in young male patients. The skull fracture is asso- ciated with tearing of a meningeal artery and a haematoma accumulates in the space between bone and dura. The most common site is temporal, as the pterion is not only the thinnest part of the skull but also overlies the largest meningeal artery - the middle meningeal.# An EDH may also occur in other regions such as frontal as well as in the posterior fossa. They are not always arte- rial: disruption of a major dural venous sinus can result in an EDH. The force required to sustain a skull fracture can be surprisingly small - a fall from standing or a single blow to the head.# The classical presentation of an EDH, occurring in less than one-third of cases, is initial injury followed by a lucid interval when the patient complains of a headache but is fully alert and orientated with no focal deficit. After minutes or hours a rapid deterioration occurs, with contralateral hemiparesis, reduced conscious level and ipsilateral pupillary dilatation as a result of brain compression and herniation.

Pa raises tissue pH, increases cerebrovascular resistance, decreases cerebral blood flow, and consequently reduces intracerebral pressure (ICP).

The metabolic compensation to induced hypocapnia leads to normalization of the pH by loss of bicarbonate (metabolic acidosis), and over 8-24 h the beneficial effects of the hypocapnia will have been lost. The partial pressures of carbon dioxide should be allowed to slowly return to normal and should be held in reserve in case unanticipated increases in ICP require another pulse of short-term reduction.

Pituitary microadenomas are less than 1 cm in size and macroadenomas are more than 1 cm. Microadenomas present with endocrine effects, whereas macroadenomas present with visual field defects. Majority of the adenomas are prolactinomas (30%), 20% are non-functioning, 15% secrete GH and 10% secrete ACTH. Baseline assessment of serum prolactin, FSH and LH, TFT and Fasting serum GH and cortisol is necessary. Prolactinomas are initially managed with dopamine agonists like bromocriptine and cabergoline. Compression of the chiasm with evidence of visual compromise, encasement of nearby cavernous sinus or carotid arteries are the indications of surgical intervention. Surgical resection is usually performed through transsphenoidal approach using a microscope or endoscope inserted through nose.

The lesion appears as a hyperdense biconvex mass between the skull and brain on CT scan. Clinical presentation is highly variable and outcome largely depends on promptness of diagnosis and surgical evacuation. The typical history is one of head trauma followed by a momentary alteration in consciousness and then a lucid interval lasting for up to a few hours. This is followed by a loss of consciousness, dilation of the pupil on the side of the epidural hematoma, and then compromise of the brainstem and death.

Intrathecal administration of low quantities of Fluorescein can also be used. If the leak is present it can be seen in the nasal cavity with a 490 nm light generated by a special optical filter. Dye injection is done using Barbolage technique in which 1-2 drops of 5% Fluorescein is diluted with the patients own CSF, and then injected partially, then CSF is withdrawn further diluting the dye and then reinjecting the dye.# CSF contains glucose which can be demonstrated by oxidase peroxidase paper strip or biochemical tests. Beta 2 transferrin is specific for CSF.> Analysis of the collected nasal fluid can be both problematic and useful. Analysis of nasal fluid is problematic because simple testing such as observing how the drainage dries on paper (Ring sign) or measuring the sugar content (reflecting the elevated glucose content of CSF) may not be valid.> Presence of the enzyme Beta2-transferrinase is only found in CSF, but requires the collection of several milliliters of fluid to be sent for highly specialized laboratory testing.> To confirm or further identify the route of CSF rhinorrhea, three forms of imaging are available.> Isotope cisternogram is the most sensitive, but least specific form of imaging. Nuclear medicine study consists of placing a low yield radioactive isotope in the subarachnoid space via a lumber puncture or spinal tap. Presence of isotope containing CSF in the nose is confirmed by measuring radioactivity within the nasal cavity or on cotton pledgets placed at probable sites of cerebral spinal fluid drainage from the cranial cavity. Contrast CT cisternography is a more specific, but a less sensitive form of imaging for CSF rhinorrhea. Requires an active leakage of CSF to the nose and involves the placement of an agent opaque to CT imaging within the subarachnoid space. Coronal CT scan is then performed to image the defect within the floor of the anterior or middle cranial fossa, and the route of drainage into the nose.> Magnetic resonance imaging is a non-radiographic procedure utilizing the detection of electromagnetic energy released from the hydrogen atom as the electron circling the nucleus descends to a lower energy level. Soft tissue contains various amounts of water and the physics of detecting changes in energy rather than density (as in the case of CT) significantly favor the former. MR imaging is the examination of choice tor visualizing potential brain anomalies, such as encephaloceles (herniation of brain into the nose or ear). MR also permits the identification of CSF draining into the nose without the use of contract, but does not visualize well bony detect in the skull base or currently lacks the detail provided by CT cisternography.",

By intracranial pressure> An alternative definition of CPP is: CPP = MAP-ICP CPP=MAP-ICPwhere: MAP is mean arterial pressure ICP is intracranial pressure JVP is jugular venous pressure> More specifically, cerebral perfusion pressure can be defined as: CPP = MAP-ICP CPP = MAP - ICP (if ICP is higher than JVP)or CPP = MAP-JVP CPP = MAP - JVP (If JVP is higher than ICP).> Physiologically, increased ICP causes decreased blood perfusion of brain cells by mainly two mechanisms: Increased ICP constitutes an increased interstitial hydrostatic pressure that, in turn, causes a decreased driving force for capillary filtration from intracerebral blood vessels. Increased ICP compresses cerebral arteries, causing increased cerebrovascular resistance (CVR). FLOW Ranging from 20ml 100g-1 min-1 in white matter to 70ml 100g-1 min-1 in grey matter.> Autoregulation: Under normal circumstances a MAP between 60 to 160 mm. Hg and ICP about 10 mm. Hg (CPP of 50-150 mm. Hg) sufficient blood flow can be maintained with autoregulation. Although the classic 'autoregulation curve' suggests that CBF is fully stable between these blood pressure values (known also as the limits of autoregulation), CBF may vary as much as 10% below and above its average within this range. Outside of the limits of autoregulation, raising MAP raises CPP and raising ICP lowers it (this is one reason that increasing ICP in traumatic brain injury is potentially deadly). In trauma some recommend CPP not go below 70 mm. Hg. Recommendations in children is at least 60 mm. Hg. Within the autoregulatory range, as CPP falls there is, within seconds, vasodilatation of the cerebral resistance vessels, a fall in cerebrovascular resistance and a rise in cerebral-blood volume (CBV), and therefore CBF will return to baseline value within seconds. These adaptations to rapid changes in blood pressure (in contrast with changes that occur over periods of hours or days) are known as dynamic cerebral autoregulation.",
