Harrison writes - \"The symptom of chronic pseudoobstruction are chronic or intermittent constipation, crampy abdominal pain, anorexia and bloating. Abdominal xrays reveal gaseous distention of the large and small bowel and occasionally of the stomach. Air-fluid levels are unusual and should raise the possibility of mechanical obstruction.\" Acute pseudoobstruction involves only the colon and presents with features of colonic obstruction (as described before). Air fluid level is also not a feature of colonic obstruction. About the fluid levels remember the following points upto 3 to 5 fluid levels less than 2.5 cm in length may be normal. multiple air-fluid levels are feature of mechanical small intestinal obstruction and paralytic ileus.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' ie. Subtotal Gastrectomy Management of Gastric carcinoma Surgical resection of stomach is the only curative treatment. It is also the best way of palliation in non-curable cases. So it's done in almost every case. Exceptions to surgery are - patients who cannot tolerate an abdominal operation and patients with overwhelming metastasis. The surgical objective should be to remove the tumor, and adjacent uninvolved margin of stomach and duodenum, the regional lymph nodes, and, if necessary, poions of involved adjacent organs. Radical subtotal gastrectomy is the standard operation for gastric cancer. -It removes distal 75% of the stomach, including the pylorus and 2 cm. of duodenum, the greater and the lesser omentum and the associated lymphatic tissue. Reconstruction is usually by Billroth II anastomosis - For curative treatment, all the margins (proximal, distal and radial) should be negative and an adequate lymphadenectomy performed. Margins are checked by frozen section biopsy. Total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy is done (splenectomy is plus/minus) - for proximal gastric carcinoma - for extensive tumors (eg. Linitis plastica) to obtain negative margins for distal gastric carcinoma Esophagogastrectomy with splenectomy is done for tumor of the cardia. Adequate lymphadenectomy must be done in all curable cases. Adjuvant Chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil & leucovorin) + Radiation therapy - their role is not very well proven Gastric Ca is relatively radioresistant tumor and radiotherapy alone has no role in treatment. The best it can be used for palliation of pain and bleeding. So in this patient Kallu, curative treatment is done by radical subtotal gastrectomy. Involvemetn of lymph nodes is no indication against curative treatment. Schwaz writes - \"It should be strongly emphasized that many patients with positive lymph nodes are cured by adequate surgery. It should also be stressed that often lymph nodes that appear to be involved with tumor turn out to be benign or reactive on pathological examination. Therefore therapeutic nihilism should be avoided, and in the low risk patients an aggressive attempt to resect all tumours should be made.\"",

Summary This year's Nobel Laureates have made a series of ground breaking discoveries concerning embryonic stem cells and DNA recombination in mammals. Their discoveries led to the creation of an immensely powerful technology referred to as gene targeting in mice. It is now being applied to viually all areas of biomedicine - from basic research to the development of new therapies. Gene targeting is often used to inactivate single genes. Such gene \"knockout\" experiments have elucidated the roles of numerous genes in embryonic development, adult physiology, aging and disease. To date, more than ten thousand mouse genes (approximately half of the gene in the mammalian genome) have been knocked out. Ongoing international effos will make \"knockout mice\" for all genes available within the near future. With gene targeting it is now possible to produce almost any type of DNA modification in the mouse genome, allowing scientists to establish the roles of individual genes in health and disease. Gene targeting has already produced more than five hundred different mouse models of human disorders, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and cancer.",

Appendectomy. Obstruction in a patient with malrotation can occur because of mid gut volvulus or because of bands (Ladd's band). Midgut volvulus can occur at any age, although it is seen most often in the first few weeks of life. Bilious vomiting is usually the first sign of volvulus, and all infants with bilious vomiting must be evaluated rapidly to ensure that they do not have intestinal malrotation with volvulus. When volvulus is suspected, early surgical intervention is done to avoid or reverse the ischemic process. Surgery: Volvulus occurs clockwise, and it is therefore untwisted counterclockwise. (This can be remembered by using the memory aid \"Turn back the hands of time.\") Subsequently, Ladd's procedure is performed. This operation does not correct the malrotation but does broaden the narrow mesenteric pedicle to prevent volvulus from recurring. Steps done in Ladd's procedure are: - duodenal and cecal bands are divided, - Broadening of the mesentery - The appendix is removed to avoid diagnostic errors in later life. This maneuver brings the straightened duodenum into the right lower quadrant and the cecum into the left lower quadrant. Note that: A subset of patients with malrotation can also present with incomplete obstruction or chronic obstruction. (so the patient here in this question has either incomplete volvulus or obstruction because of-duodenal hand) Ladd's procedure is performed to prevent voluvulus ; however, volvulus can still occur rarely after Ladd's procedure.",

Normal findings on chest and abdominal radiographs do not exclude splenic injury. USG/Focused abdominal sonar for trauma (FAST) is commonly used as the bedside investigation of choice for detection of intra-abdominal blood in abdominal trauma. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is especially useful in the hypotensive, unstable patient with multiple injuries as a means of excluding intrabdominal bleeding. DPL has been largely replaced by FAST. It is extremely sensitive to the presence of intra-peritoneal bleeding, being able to pick up just 20m1 of blood (Sensitivity 85-98%) Relative contraindications to DPL include near term pregnancy (DPL should be carried out supra-umbilically in this situation), presence of a coagulopathy, cirrhosis, and multiple prior abdominal operations. A DPL is deemed positive if blood or bowel contents are aspirated from the abdomen. It is also determined to be positive if on analysis of the dialysate, greater than 100,000 RBC/mml or 5000 WBC/ mm3 are found. False positives on DPL may occur from abdominal wall bleeding from a traumatic catheter placement and from pelvic fractures. CT is the modality of choice for evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma in stable patient because it is not only sensitive, but also has a high specificity. In addition to being able to identify the presence of intra-abdominal fluid, individual organ damage can be identified. Retroperitoneal trauma may be identified and tril trauma not requiring laparotomy may be diagnosed as such.",

        "exp": "The decision to intervene should be based on signs, symptoms,\u00a0 and\u00a0 functional\u00a0 impairment.\u00a0The\u00a0decision\u00a0need not be made hastily because ZMC fractures are not emergencies and treatment can be delayed, if necessary. However, during the first week following trauma, the soft tissue\u00a0 undergoes\u00a0 changes\u00a0 consistent\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 usual sequence of wound healing. The form that they will ultimately\u00a0 take\u00a0 depends\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 underlying\u00a0 bony architecture. Optimally,\u00a0 fractures\u00a0 are\u00a0 treated\u00a0 before the onset of edema from the traumatic incident. In practice, however, such timing of treatment is rarely possible.\u00a0\nWhen\u00a0 edema\u00a0 is\u00a0 moderate\u00a0 to\u00a0 severe,\u00a0 postponement\u00a0 of surgery\u00a0 for\u00a0 several\u00a0 days\u00a0 makes\u00a0 thorough\u00a0 examination and\u00a0 surgical\u00a0 treatment\u00a0 reliable\u00a0 and\u00a0 much\u00a0 easier\u00a0 tasks. Therefore,\u00a0 postponement\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 decision\u00a0 to\u00a0 operate until\u00a0 facial\u00a0 edema\u00a0 resolves\u00a0 is\u00a0 recommended\u00a0 when\u00a0 the necessity for intervention is questionable. This approach may\u00a0 be\u00a0 used\u00a0 in\u00a0 fractures\u00a0 that\u00a0 are\u00a0 minimally\u00a0 displaced, when\u00a0 radiographic\u00a0 examination\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 internal\u00a0 orbit shows\u00a0 no\u00a0 major\u00a0 defects.\u00a0 However,\u00a0 if\u00a0 the\u00a0 radiographic findings\u00a0 are\u00a0 so\u00a0 dramatic\u00a0 that\u00a0 intervention\u00a0 is\u00a0 definitely necessary, it may be advantageous to perform the surgery\u00a0regardless of the facial edema present, because the final soft\u00a0 tissue\u00a0 contour\u00a0 may\u00a0 be\u00a0 superior\u00a0 to\u00a0 that\u00a0 which\u00a0 may occur when surgery is postponed. If the surgeon decides not to intervene, the patient should be observed for 2 to 3 weeks and a soft diet should be prescribed.\nOne should always remember that if a force is sufficient to produce a fracture of the zygoma, it is also sufficient\u00a0 to\u00a0 produce\u00a0 intracranial\u00a0 injuries.\u00a0 ZMC\u00a0 fractures are not life-threatening injuries and should not be given\u00a0priority over more acute problems. Treatment need not be hastened if the neurologic state of the patient is in\u00a0question\u00a0 because\u00a0 zygomatic\u00a0 fractures\u00a0 can\u00a0 be\u00a0 satisfactorily\u00a0 treated\u00a0 in\u00a0 several\u00a0 days,\u00a0 after\u00a0 the\u00a0 facial\u00a0 edema\u00a0 has resolved.\nRef: Fonseca 4th ed page no 363",

He describes a rapidly evolving weakness affecting his legs and feet staing 2 days ago. On physical examination he cannot move his feet or ankles and he can barely raise his thighs off the bed. He has symmetrical hyporeflexia of the legs, but his sensorium is completely intact. Scanning his cha, the physician notes that he was treated 10 days previously for an upper respiratory tract infection. The immunological response producing the patient's symptoms is most intense at which of the following locations?",
        "exp": "The patient has developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, also known as inflammatory polyneuropathy. This presentation is classic-rapidly evolving limb weakness with symmetrical hyporeflexia but normal sensation. The syndrome frequently follows viral infections and may evolve into complete paralysis with respiratory failure. Guillain-Barre syndrome is thought to be an autoimmune disease. The clinical course is correlated with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate and demyelination of peripheral nerves, especially spinal and cranial motor nerve roots. Inflammation localized to a small poion of spinal cord (lateral coicospinal tracts) or cerebral coex (precentral gyrus) may occur in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or in multiple sclerosis (MS). PML occurs in the immunosuppressed, and MS presents with hyperreflexia (upper motor neuron signs). The classic autoimmune disease involving the neuromuscular junction is myasthenia gravis. Although the weakness caused by myasthenia gravis may affect the legs, extraocular muscles are involved in the majority of cases, and isolated limb weakness is rare.

During the day, this may present as increased frequency of urination (polyuria). At night, in some children, it presents as bedwetting (enuresis). Most children require a split-dose (every 12 hours) of insulin to maintain good glycemic control. Emotional stress of chronic disease is an unlikely cause of enuresis. A urinary tract infection typically presents as other signs and symptoms, such as unexplained fever and abdominal complaints. If an evening dosage of insulin is too high, hypoglycemia (without obvious signs or symptoms) may occur during sleep, resulting in the release of counter regulatory hormones and an elevated blood sugar in the morning. These events, termed the Somogyi phenomenon, are unlikely to cause enuresis. Hypoglycemia may be associated with early morning lethargy, pallor, sweating, and a seizure. Enuresis is not a feature.",

They are generally divided into two types: (1) simple or capillary lymphangioma and (2) cavernous lymphangioma or cystic hygroma. They are thought to represent isolated and sequestered segments of the lymphatic system that retain the ability to produce lymph. As the volume of lymph inside the cystic tumor increases, they grow larger within the surrounding tissues. Most of these benign tumors are present at bih, and 90% of them can be identified by the end of the first year of life. The cavernous lymphangioma almost invariably occur in the neck or the axilla and rarely in the retroperitoneum. The simple capillary lymphangioma also tend to occur subcutaneously in the head and neck region as well as the axilla. Rarely, however, they can be found in the trunk within the internal organs or the connective tissue in and around the abdominal or thoracic cavities. The treatment of lymphangioma is surgical excision, taking care to preserve all normal surrounding infiltrated structures. Lymphangiosarcoma is a rare tumor that develops as a complication of long-standing (usually more than 10 years) lymphedema. Clinically, patients present with acute worsening of the edema and appearance of subcutaneous nodules that have a propensity toward hemorrhage and ulceration. The tumor can be treated, as other sarcomas, with preoperative chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgical excision, which usually takes the form of radical amputation.

B: May lead to lung infarction Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) most commonly involves the deep veins of the leg or arm, often resulting in potentially life-threatening emboli to the lungs. Emboli travel from the lower limb large veins and vena cava, through the right hea and lodges into the pulmonary aeries. This may totally occlude perfusion to all or pa of one or both lungs (pulmonary emboli). Acute right hea obstruction may lead to sudden collapse and death. Lung infarction is rare as the lung has a dual blood supply (bronchial and pulmonary aeries) Factors have been identified as known risk factors for the development of venous thrombosis. The single most powerful risk marker remains a prior history of DVT with up to 25% of acute venous thrombosis occurring in such patients. However, recurrent thrombosis may actually be the result of primary hypercoagulable states.

Ultrasound and CT can be utilized to make the diagnosis in equivocal cases. Lets also see the management of appendicitis: Management of appendicitis: The treatment of appendicitis is appendectomy. (It can be done open or laparoscopically) Prophylactic antibiotics are indicated preoperatively. Postoperative antibiotic coverage is of no use in simple (uncomplicated) acute appendicitis. If perforated or gangrenous appendicitis is found, antibiotics are continued until the patient is afebrile and has a normal white blood cell count. Perforated Appendicitis (Maingot's 11/e p603) Rupture is suspected in the presence of fever with a temperature of >39degC (102degF) and a white blood cell count of >18,000 cells/mm3. The management of perforation depends on the nature of the perforation. If the perforation is free causing intraperitoneal dissemination of pus and fecal material, urgent laparotomy is done for appendectomy and irrigation and drainage of the peritoneal cavity. If the perforation is contained it would result in an appediceal mass or abscess. This is managed as described under. Appendiceal Abscess/ Mass Patients who present late in the course of appendicitis with a palpable or radiographically documented mass (abscess or phlegmon) are treated with? conservative therapy and interval appendectomy 6 to 10 weeks later. (conservative management includes intravenous antibiotics and fluids as well as bowel rest.) - Patients with large abscesses, greater than 4 to 6 cm in size, and especially those patients with abscess and high fever, benefit from abscess drainage. Patients who continue to have fever, persistent pain and leukocytosis or develop complications like bowel obstruction after several days of nonoperative treatment are likely to require immediate appendectomy during the same hospitalization, whereas those who improve promptly may be considered for interval appendectomy.

These injuries are common in both rural and urban environments and result from motor vehicle crashes, domestic violence, spoing events, and accidents involving bicycle handlebars. The clinical presentation of splenic injury is highly variable. Most patients with minor focal injury to the spleen complain of left upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Left shoulder tenderness may also be present as a result of subdiaphragmatic nerve root irritation with referred pain. With free intraperitoneal blood, diffuse abdominal pain, peritoneal irritation, and rebound tenderness are more likely. If the intra-abdominal bleeding exceeds 5-10% of blood volume, clinical signs of early shock may manifest. Hypotension in a patient with a suspected splenic injury, especially if young and previously healthy, is a grave sign and a surgical emergency.",

Microscopically, the tumor is composed of thin, irregular, trabeculae within a cellular granulation tissue containing osteoblasts and osteoclasts.Trabeculae are more mature in the center, which is often paially calcified. Reactive, sclerotic bone surrounds the nidus. Clinical features of osteoid osteoma The tumor occurs between 10-30 years of age and is more common in males. The diaphysis of long bones is involved, most common bone involved is the tibia followed by femur. Posterior elements of the veebrae may also be involved. The presenting complaint is a nagging pain, worst at night, and is relieved by salicylates or other NSAIDs, a diagnostic feature. On X-ray, there is a small radiolucent area (nidus) surrounded by dens sclerosis. X-ray, in some cases, show local sclerotic thickening of the shaft that may obscure the small central nidus within the area of rarefaction. Bone scan shows increased uptake in the nidus.

        "question": "In cases of burn, which is the fluid of choice in the first 24 hours?",
        "exp": "Proper fluid management is critical to survival in a burn patient.\nThe hypovolemic shock in burn patient is special in the sense that the total body water remains unchanged in a burn patient. The thermal injury leads to a massive fluid shift from the intravascular compartment to the extravascular compartment (interstitial + intracellular) leading to edema formation (in both burned parts and non burned parts of the body)\nThis fluid shift is maximum in the first 24 hrs.\nFluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution - Ringer's lactate solution (RL) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extravascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume.\nThe quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i.e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas)\nhalf of the calculated fluid is given in the first 8 hrs and a half in next 16 hrs.\nColloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capillaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning)\nA number of parameters are widely used to assess burn resuscitation, but the most common remains the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patient, the target MAP is 60 mmHg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients.\nThere is no use of diuretics in burn resuscitation.\nChildren under 20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",

The typical scar is 1.5 to 2 cm long and should be completely excised. The proximal and distal urethra can be mobilized for a tension-free, end-to-end anastomosis. This is a highly successful procedure in more than 95% of cases. Endoscopic incision (urethrotomy) through the scar tissue of an obliterated urethra is a hopeless procedure and uniformly fails. Partial urethral narrowing can initially be treated by endoscopic incision with higher success.

Further, patients who have had repeated endoscopic procedures are also more likely to require complex reconstructive procedures such as grafts\" \u2014 Campbell's Urology\n\"Urethroplasty should be considered when the stricture has arisen following trauma, and when a stricture has recurred following endoscopic treatment. \"- Bailey\nUrethroplasty can be of two types:\n\n\nexcision and end-to-end anastomosis- done for short stricture segments (\u22642 cm)\n\n\npatch urethroplasty- for longer segments",

        "exp": "Positive family history is definitively the most significant risk factor of developing breast cancer among the ones mentioned in the list. About 5% to 10% of cases are attributable to inheritance of autosomal dominant genes. Most hereditary cases of breast cancer are due to two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are tumor suppressor genes probably involved in DNA repair. There are additional rare \"susceptibility\" genes, namely those causing Li-Fraumeni syndrome (mutations of p53), Cowden syndrome (mutations of a gene on chromosome 10), and ataxia-telangiectasia (mutations of ATM gene). Note, however, that 80% to 90% of women with breast cancer do not have a positive family history. The role of exogenous estrogens, including those administered with bih control pills or postmenopausal replacement therapy, is still debated. If there is any associated risk for breast cancer, this is minimal. There is no convincing evidence linking caffeine consumption or cigarette smoking to breast cancer.

Carbon monoxide (CO) diffusing capacity provides an estimate of the rate at which oxygen moves by diffusion from alveolar gas to combine with hemoglobin in the red blood cells. It is interpreted as an index of the surface area engaged in alveolar-capillary diffusion. Measurement of diffusing capacity of the lung is done by having the person inspire a low concentration of carbon monoxide. The rate of uptake of the gas by the blood is calculated from the difference between the inspired and expired concentrations. The test can be performed during a single 10-second breath holding or during 1 minute of steady-state breathing. The diffusing capacity is defined as the amount of carbon monoxide transferred per minute per millimeter of mercury of driving pressure and correlates with oxygen transpo from the alveolus into the capillaries. Primary parenchymal disorders, anemia, and removal of lung tissue decrease the diffusing capacity. Conversely, polycythemia, congestive hea failure, and intrapulmonary hemorrhage tend to increase the value for diffusing capacity. In this patient, the possibility of Goodpasture syndrome would be considered.",

Increased ICP One of the most damaging aspects of brain trauma and other conditions, directly correlated with poor outcome, is an elevated intracranial pressure. The body's response to a decrease in CPP is to raise blood pressure and dilate blood vessels in the brain. This results in increased cerebral blood volume, which increases ICP, lowering CPP fuher and causing a vicious cycle. Neurologic changes seen in increased ICP are mostly due to hypoxia and hypercapnea and are as follows: decreased LOC, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, hyperventilation, sluggish dilated pupils and widened pulse pressure. Signs and symptoms of increased ICP In general, symptoms and signs that suggest a rise in ICP including headache, nausea, vomiting, ocular palsies, altered level of consciousness, and papilledema. If papilledema is protracted, it may lead to visual disturbances, optic atrophy, and eventually blindness. In addition to the above, if mass effect is present with resulting displacement of brain tissue, additional signs may include pupillary dilatation, abducens (CrN VI) palsies, and the Cushing's triad. Cushing's triad involves an increased systolic blood pressure, a widened pulse pressure, bradycardia, and an abnormal respiratory pattern. In children, a slow hea rate is especially suggestive of high ICP. Irregular respirations occur when injury to pas of the brain interfere with the respiratory drive. In infants and small children, the effects of ICP differ because their cranial sutures have not closed. In infants, the fontanelles, or soft spots on the head where the skull bones have not yet fused, bulge when ICP gets too high.",

Elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, serum GGT and 5' nucleotidase indicates cholestasis. 5' nucleotidase is an enzyme specific to the liver. It is elevated in patients with liver diseases, especially those associated with cholestasis. Alkaline phosphatase is found primarily in the liver and bones. In the liver it is expressed by the bile duct epithelium and its levels are increased in conditions of biliary obstruction. Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase enzyme is found in the hepatocytes and are released from the bile duct epithelium. Elevated levels of this enzyme is an early marker and also a sensitive test for hepatobiliary disease. Ref: Schwaz's Principles of Surgery, 9e chapter 31.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Bulbocavernous reflex Spinal shock Spinal shock refers to the period after spinal cord injury (usually 24-48 hours) when the reflex activity of the entire spinal cord becomes depressed. During this period the reflex arcs below the level of spinal cord injury are not functioning. Spinal shock is basically flaccid paralysis with loss of all spinal reflexes. There is loss of autonomic, reflex, motor and sensory activity below the level of the cord lesion. Signs of spinal shock include : 1. Flaccid paralysis 2. Loss of deep tendon and perianal reflexes The return of reflex activity below the level of a spinal cord injury signifies the end of spinal shock. o An accurate assessment of neurological status cannot be completed until spinal shock resolves. The earliest indicator of resolution is the return of bulbocavernous reflex. The significance of spinal shock lies in the determination of whether a patient has sustained a complete vs incomplete spinal cord injury. This cannot be determined until spinal shock has ended. If there is total absence of sensory or motor function below the level of in jury, after spinal shock has resolved, It indicates complete cord injury. If there is some residual function distal to the level of injury after resolution of spinal shock indicates incomplete cord injury. High thoracic cord has poor prognosis as this area has narrow spinal canal and precarious blood supply, watershade area of blood supply lies in upper thoracic region.",

Offspring of women with epilepsy have 2 to 3 times the risk of congenital anomalies even in the absence of anticonvulsant medications because seizures cause a transient reduction in uterine blood flow and fetal oxygenation. When anticonvulsant medications are used, pregnant women have an even greater risk of congenital malformations. It is recommended that women undergo a trial of being weaned off their medications prior to becoming pregnant. If antiseizure medications must be used, monotherapy is preferred to minimize the risk to the fetus since the incidence of fetal anomalies increases as additional anticonvulsants are consumed. Many anticonvulsants have been found to impair folate metabolism, and folate supplementation in pregnancy has been associated with a decreased incidence of congenital anomalies in epileptic women taking antiseizure medications.

        "exp": "Valve replacement will ameliorate CCF The question is about carditis in Rheumatic .fever. carditis is one of the major criterias for the diagnosis of Rheumatic fever. Carditis Carditis occur in 50-60% patients with acute Rheumatic fever carditis and resultant chronic rheumatic hea disease are the most serious manifestations of acute rheumatic fever. Rheumatic carditis is characterized by pancarditis with active inflammation of all the three layers of the hea : Myocardium - Pericardium - Endocardium Endocarditis Endocarditis (Valvulitis) which is manifested by one or more cardiac murmurs is universal findinv in rheumatic carditis whereas the presence of pericariditis or myocarditis is variable. Endocarditis or valvular damage is the hallmark of Rheumatic fever, the mitral valve is almost always affected sometimes together with Aoic valve. Serious and long tenn illness is entirely related to valvular hea disease. Pericarditis Pericarditis most commonly causes pericardial effusion which results in pleural friction rub on echocardiography and may occasionally cause pleuritic chest pain. Myocarditis Myocardial involvement is almost never responsible in itself for cardiac failure. Myocarditis perse plays little or any role in the morbidity of rheumatic fever. Evidence for absence of myocarditis playing any role in the morbidity and moality of rheumatic fever is based on the following. - Troponin 7(2-a marker of myocardial damage has been found not to increase during acute rheumatic .fever with carditis indicating absence of significant myocardial damage. - Radionuclide evaluations using antimyosin antibody indicates insignificant myocardial uptake (hence absence of significant damage) in the absence of pericarditis and C.C.F. - Myocardial biopsies during acute rheumatic fever with carditis have .failed to provide information regarding presence of myocarditis because of paucity of myocardial damage. - Echocardiographic evaluation of the left ventricular function indicates that the myocardial contractility (the capacity of myocardium to contract) remains normalQ even in the presence of C.C.F. - Pathological evaluation (biopsy) of the myocardium indicates that the amount of myocardial damage is insufficient to explain the moality. - Surgical replacement of mitral and/or aoic valve during acute rheumatic fever results in rapid control of CCF and decrease in hea size, despite investigational evidence for ongoing active rheumatic .fever. The surgical findings thus indicate that it is the acute hemodynamic overload secondary to valvular regurgitation which is responsible .for CCF.",

While bright red lower GI bleeding tends to indicate lower GI bleeding (bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz), brisk upper GI bleeding can also be the source. The clinical manifestations of such bleeding range from negligible to hemodynamic instability, depending upon the rate of bleeding. The differential diagnosis for painless hematochezia includes AV malformations, gastric erosions, esophageal varices, esophagitis, duodenal or gastric ulcer, hemorrhoids, diveiculosis, and colonic neoplasm. Diveiculitis occurs when a colonic outpouching or diveiculum becomes inflamed. Patients tend to be elderly and present with fever, abdominal pain, and abdominal tenderness on examination. While painful, these lesions do not bleed significantly (unlike their uninflamed counterpas in diveiculosis). Infectious colitis may present as rectal bleeding, but this bleeding is typically accompanied by pain, cramping, and fever. Causative organisms may include Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni, E. coli, and Entamoeba histolytica.

        "exp": "Post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is defined as a chronic pain condition, typically neuropathy in nature, that can follow surgery to the breast. PMPS can occur with any surgery to the breast, including mastectomy, lumpectomy, reconstruction, and augmentation. PMPS can be divided into three categories: phantom breast pain, intercostobrachial neuralgia, and neuroma pain. Phantom pain consists of painful sensations in the area of the removed breast. The intercostobrachial nerve is the lateral cutaneous nerve of the second thoracic root. It courses along the axillary vein and then provides sensation to the axilla and breast. The intercostobrachial nerve is frequently stretched or sacrificed during axillary lymph node dissections and is a common cause of PMPS. The scar from breast surgery can be a generator of pain. The pain has been attributed to underlying neuroma formation, axon impingement, and scar retraction. The symptoms associated with PMPS include shooting, stabbing, burning, and pins and needles in the breast, axilla, or medial arm.

Diabetes is considered to be the most common cause of Charcot ahropathy Acute Charcot ahropathy almost always presents with signs of inflammation. Profound unilateral swelling, an increase in local skin temperature (generally, an increase of 3-7 degrees above the nonaffected foot's skin temperature), erythema, joint effusion, and bone resorption in an insensate foot are present. These characteristics, in the presence of intact skin and a loss of protective sensation, are often pathognomonic of acute Charcot ahropathy. Pain can occur in more than 75% of patients; however, the pain's severity is significantly less than would be expected based on the severity of the clinical and/or radiographic findings. Instability and loss of joint function also may be present.

A few cases of rupture of the tibialis anterior tendon leading to foot drop and suspicion of peroneal nerve palsy have occurred. This subcutaneous tendon rupture usually occurs after a minor trauma with the foot in plantar flexion. Compament syndromes also may lead to foot drop. March gangrene, a form of anterior compament syndrome, is thought to be due to edema and small hemorrhages in the muscles of the anterior compament occurring after strenuous activity in individuals not accustomed to it. Deep posterior compament syndrome also may result in foot drop as a late sequela due to resultant contracture formation. Neurologic causes of foot drop include mononeuropathies of the deep peroneal, common peroneal, or sciatic nerves. Lumbosacral plexopathy, lumbar radiculopathy, motor neuron disease, or parasagittal coical or subcoical cerebral lesions also can manifest as foot drop. These lesions can be differentiated through clinical and electrodiagnostic examinations. A common behavioral cause of foot drop is habitual crossing of the legs. These cases typically resolve with discontinuation of the habit. Foot drop also may be seen as a combination of neurologic, muscular, and anatomic dysfunction. Charcot foot is one example.",

        "exp": "Ischemic Rest Pain: Ischemic rest pain is a grave symptom caused by ischemic neuritis- indicates advanced aerial insufficiency that usually terminates in gangrene and amputation of the extremity if aerial reconstruction cannot be performed. In ischemic rest pain there is severe burning pain usually confined to the forefoot distal to the metatarsals. It may be localized to the vicinity of an ischemic ulcer or pre gangrenous toe. It is aggravated by the elevation of the extremity or by bringing the leg to the horizontal position. Thus, it appear at bed rest (hence the name) and may prevent sleep. Because gravity aids the delivery of aerial blood, classically, the patient with rest pain can obtain relief by simply hanging the leg over the side of the bed. This simple maneuver will not relieve the pain caused by peripheral neuropathy, the most common cause of foot pain at rest. If the foot is constantly kept dependant to relieve pain, the leg and foot may be swollen, causing some confusion in diagnosis. Ischemic neuritis pain is severe and resistant to opioid for relief. Rest pain occur when blood flow is inadequate to meet metabolic requirements. In the lower extremity, ischemic rest pain is localized to the forefoot and generally is easily distinguished from benign nocturnal muscle cramps in the calf, which are also common in old patients. Patients often have trophic changes, such as muscle wasting, thinning of skin, thickening of nails, and hair loss in the distal affected limb.

        "exp": "Insulin + glucose Tall T waves on ECG indicate cardiac manifestation of hyperkalemia. - Intravenous calcium gluconate is the first drug to be administered in a patient with hyperkalemia having E.C.G. abnormalities. - It stabilizes the myocardium immediately. - It acts within minutes and is characterized by improvement in E.C.G. appearance. But an impoant point to note - It does not affect transcellular movement of potassium. Thus it won't help in reducing the hyperkalemia. Among the agents which cause transcellular (intracellular) movement of potassium. - \"Intravenous insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levels\". The goals of the therapy for the tit of acute hyperkalemia in chronological order are as follows:? i) Antagonize the affect of IC on excitable cell membranes ii) Redistribution of extracellular potassium into cells iii) Enhance elimination of potassium from the body i) Antagonize the effect of potassium on excitable cell membrane Calcium directly antagonizes the myocardial effect of hyperkalemia. It does so by reducing the threshold potential of cardiac myocytes. Calcium. for injection is available as chloride or gluconate salt. The preferred agent is the gluconate salt since it is less likely than calcium chloride to cause tissue necrosis. The onset of action is < 3 minutes. The duration of action is 30-60 minutes during which time fuher measures may be undeaken to lower p1{. ii) Redistribution of potassium into cells :? Insulin Insulin shifts potassium into cells. Potassium shift inside the cells is mediated by Na+ IC ATPase. I.V. insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levelr2. The onset of action is < 15 minutes and the effect is maximal b/w 30-60 minutes. Dextrose is given along with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. It was believed that administration of dextrose alone, can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin release. * The administration of hypeonic dextrose alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasons:- Endogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for a therapeutic effect. - There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypeonicity. 5' adrenoceptor agonists These drugs can also cause movement of potassium inside the cell. High dose albuterol shows their effect in 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours. The effect of insulin is additive with that of albuterol. Patients taking nonselective 18 adrenoceptor blockers will be unlikely to manifest the hypokalemic effects of albuterol. - Even among patients not taking ft blockers as many as 40% seem to be resistant to the hypokalemic effect of albuterol. - The mechanism .for this resistance is unknown and currently, there is no basis for predicting which patients will respond. - For this reason albuterol should never be used as a single agent for the treatment of urgent hyperkalemia. Bicarbonate Bicarbonate (as a bolus injection) was used in the emergency t/t of hyperkalemia. Ironically this dogma was based on studies using a prolonged (4-6 hrs) infusion of bicarbonate. It has now been demonstrated that sho term bicarbonate infusion does not reduce pK in patients with dialysis dependent kidney failure, implying that it does not cause IC+ shift into cells. Sodium bicarbonate seems to have no effect to shift IC into cells even after several hours. It is likely to be effective especially in combination with a diuretic drug in enhancing urinary IC' elimination in patients with some kidney. function, although it use for this purpose has not been evaluated. iii) Elimination of potassium from the body Hyperkalemia occurs most often in patients with renal insufficiency. - However renal potassium excretion may be enhanced even in patients with significant renal impairment by increasing the delivery of solute to the distal nephron. Sodium bicarbonate A sodium bicarbonate infusion administered during 4-6 hrs at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine may enhance urinary K+ excretion and would be desirable especially in patients with metabolic acidosis. The risk of volume expansion with the bicarbonate infusion can be mitigated by use of loop acting diuretics which would, be likely to enhance the kaliuresis. Exchange resin Sodium polysterene sulfonate is a cation exchange resin. In the lumen of intestine it exchanges sodium for secreted potassium. Most of this exchange takes place in the colon, the site of most potassium secretion in the gut. There are two concerns with the use of resin in the t/t of urgent hyperkalemia The first is its slow effect - When given orally, the onset of action is at least 2 hrs and the maximum effect may not be seen for more than 6 hrs. The second is its adverse effect - It can cause intestinal necrosis Dialysis -\"Hemodialysis is the method of choice for removing potassium from the body\". - The rate of potassium removed with peritoneal dialysis is much slower than with hemodialysis.",

It is believed or proposed that due to ischemia the hea is stunned .for a period of time. So even after the blood flow is restored the hea will not regain its function immediately. It will remain in its dysfunctional state for a ceain period of time and then resumes its normal activity. Its should be noted that myocardial stunning is a fully reversible abnormally, provided of course that sufficient time is allowed for myocardiunt to recover. Hibernating and stunned myocardium are clinically very impoant conditions of contractile asynergy, since they are potentially reversible Hibernating myocardium is similar to stunned myocardium in that both are characterized by ble myocardial cell with depressed function. When ischemia is relieved the hibernating myocardium exhibits nearly \"immediate return\" of function where as stunned myocardium exhibit \"gradual recovery\"",

Patients may gain some root function about the level of injury - a phenomenon called root escape, because this damage to nerve roots is a peripheral nerve injury (& may be neuroprexia).

Documentation of sacral nerve !but function (perianal sensation, rectal tone and flexion of great toe) may be the only sign of paially functioning spinal cord or incomplete lesion. Central Cord Syndrome It occurs d/t damage of spinal cord near central canal area. Main causes are hyperextension trauma, Syringomyelia, tumor and anterior spinal aery ischemia. It is most frequent of incomplete cord syndromes and occurs most frequently in elderly people with underlying degenerative spolidylosis. Dissociative motor weakness with arm weakness out of propoion to leg weaknessQ Sacral sensory sparingQ - 'Dissociated sensory loss' signifying a loss of pain and temperature sense (lateral spinothalmic tract) in a cape distribution over the shoulders, lower neck, and upper trunk in contrast to intact light touch, joint position, and vibration sense (posterior column) in these regions. - 50- 75% show some neurological improvement in following order- return of lower extremity strength, return of bladder function, return of upper extremity strength, and return of intrinsic function of the hand. Anterior Cord Syndrome Both spinothalmic & coicospinal tracts (located in the anterior aspect of spinal cord) are injured with preserv-ation of dorsal columns - Variable loss of pain and temperature sensation and motor functions with preservation of proprioceptio n, vibrator sense and deep pressure sensationQ Brown Sequard Syndrome It is functional hemisection of spinal cord 1/t motor weakness on ipsilateral side of lesion & sensory deficit on the contralateral side (in broad terms.) It consist of ipsilateral motor (coicospinal tract) and propriaception (posterior column) loss and contralateral pain & temperature (spinothalmic tract) sensory lossQ.

        "exp": "Aspiration pneumonitis is a major cause of anesthesia-related death in obstetrics. Most often, these aspiration events occur with the use of general anesthesia. Pregnant patients are at greater risk for aspiration because of the delayed gastric emptying that occurs during pregnancy and labor. Pregnancy is associated with increased levels of progesterone and displacement of the pylorus by the pregnant uterus. Labor is associated with pain and stress. All of these factors lead to delayed gastric emptying. Aspiration pneumonitis is caused by acidic gastric juices entering the lungs and inducing a sometimes-lethal chemical pneumonitis. When epidural anesthesia is administered, there is a risk of complications, including the development of total spinal anesthesia. The treatment for this complication is positive-pressure ventilation with 100% oxygen administered through an endotracheal tube. Therefore, when an epidural is going to be placed, the patient should be given an antacid to increase the stomach pH. This will help to prevent aspiration pneumonitis should an aspiration event take place during the administration of general anesthesia. It is not necessary to give an antibiotic prior to the administration of an epidural. Antibiotics are used during labor for the prevention of group B Streptococcus sepsis, for patients with chorioamnionitis, for patients in need of valve or endocarditis prophylaxis, or during cesarean delivery for the prevention of infection. Aspirin is not given prior to the placement of an epidural. A clear liquid meal should not be given to patients prior to the placement of an epidural.

The differential diagnosis should include other causes of abdominal pain, such as acute appendicitis. The most common stone consists of calcium oxalate and up to 80 per cent of renal stones are visible on ultrasound. The KUB US scan is poor at differentiating different stones and can often miss smaller stones. Intravenous urography (IVU) (C) is more useful for detecting obstructions in the renal tract and US scans should always be done before IVU as smaller stones often become nonvisible. IVU scans as it is able to differentialte upto 99 percent of renal stones and it is also useful for exploring other causes of an acute abdomen. However, the radiation risk to the patient makes this investigation much more invasive and is not as readily available as an US scan. An MRI scan (B) has only a few advantages over a CT scan, these include the ability to assess renal aeries and there is no risk form radiation. However, MRI has poor differentiation ability and stones can often appear similar to tumours of blood clots. Where it is paicularly impoant to avoid radiation x-ray (A) is reasonable in detecting renal stones (up to 80 per cent) since the majority consist of calcium which shows up well on radiograph films, however, there is again a radiation risk to the patient which is avoidable in USG scans.",

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common inherited single gene disorder. It is characterized by increased intestinal absorption of iron, with deposition of iron in multiple organs. Persons with hereditary hemochromatosis absorb only a few milligrams of iron each day in excess of need. Therefore, clinical manifestations often occur only after 40 years of age, when body iron stores have reached 15-40g (normally, the body stores approximately 4g of iron). In the past hereditary hemochromatosis was usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. The classical description was : ? - Cutaneous hyperpigmentation. - Diabetes mellitus - Cirrhosis Currently, most patients with newly diagnosed hereditary hemochromatosis are asymptomatic i.e., diagnosed at an early state when the patient is still asymptomatic. The shift towards earlier diagnosis is probably the result of including serum iron indices in the diagnosis. Such as : Serum iron - Serum iron binding capacity - % transferrin saturation and serum ferritin These are elevated in hemochromatosis long before the symptoms of hemochromatosis have developed. Therefore serum iron indices are used as screening test for the diagnosis of Heruochromatosis. A.Percent transferrin saturation Percent transferrin saturation is the earliest phenotypic marker of hereditary hemoehromatosisQ. \"It is the best screening test used for the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis.\" Biron binding capacity Now days iron binding capacity is being increasingly used as the screening test for the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. Many trials have proved that : Iron binding capacity is better than % transferrin saturation as a screening test, but its wide scale use has not been staed till now. C.Serum Ferritin Serum ferritin concentration is usually a good index of body iron stores. Serum ferritin is increased in most untreated patients with hemochromatosis. Asymptomatic or symptomatic family members with the disease have increased serum ferritin. But serum ferritin is not used as screening marker because its act as acute phase reactant and its level is increased in various inflammatory conditions. Besides that its level is also increased in alcoholic liver disease and other hepatocellular injury due to increased release from tissues. Confirmatory testing of hereditary hemochromatosis : Is done by genetic analysis, which is more reliable than determining iron content in liver biopsies. Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with mutations in the HFE genee. Between 60-93 percent of patients with this disorder are homozygous for mutation designated C282Ye.

Biopsy First investigation is -------> FNAC Best & the definitive investigation is -------> Open biopsy Preferred method -------> Core needle biopsy \"Core-needle biopsy is the preferred method for diagnosis of palpable or nonpalpable breast abnormalities.\" - Schwaz 9/e p425 The diagnosis of breast cancer depends ultimately upon examination of tissue or cells removed by biopsy or FNAC (also known as FNA biopsy). The treatment should never be undeaken without a confirmed diagnosis of cancer. Thus a biopsy (biopsy includes all kinds of biopsy including FNA biopsy, also known as FNAC) should be done of all suspicious masses found on physical examination and in the absence of a mass of suspicious lesions demonstrated by mammography. A breast mass should not be followed without a biopsy. Exception to this is perhaps in the premenopausal woman with a nonsuspicious mass presumed to be fibrocystic disease. A lesion such as this could be observed through one or two menstrual cycles. However if the mass does not completely resolve during this time, it must be biopsied. For biopsy, FNAC (or FNAB) is the simplest method Schwaz writes - \"The combination of diagnostic mammography, ultrasound or sterotactic localization and fine needle aspiration biopsy is almost 100% accurate in the diagnosis of breast cancer. However while FNA biopsy permits cytological evaluation, core-needle or open biopsy also permits the analysis of breast tissue architecture and allows the pathologist to determine whether invasive cancer is present. Core-needle biopsy is preferred over open biopsy for nonpalpable breast lesions because a single surgical procedure can be planned based on the results of the core biopsy. The advantages of core-needle biopsy include a low complication rate, avoidance of scarring, and a lower cost.\" CSDT writes? \"Open biopsy under local anaesthesia as a separate procedure prior to deciding upon definitive treatment is the most reliable means of diagnosis.\"",
