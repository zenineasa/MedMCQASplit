Nutritional deficiencies may especially vitamin B12 deficiency (Since Intrinsic factor secreted by parietal cell of stomach is necessary for vitamin B32 absorption). Symptoms of Vitamin B12 deficiency. The main syndrome of vitamin BI2 deficiency is Biermers disease (pernicious anemia). It is characterized by a triad of symptoms: Anemia with bone marrow promegaioblastosis (Megaloblastic anemia). This is due to the inhibition of DNA synthesis (specifically purines and thymidine). Gastrointestinal symptoms. This may also be due to the autoimmune attack on the parietal cells of the stomach in pernicious anemia. Neurological symptoms: Sensory or motor deficiencies (absent reflexes, diminished vibration or soft touch sensation). Subacute combined degeneration of spinal chord. Dementia. Psychiatric symptoms may be present.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Reduction of part of stomach Dumping syndrome -o Symptom complex that occurs following ingestion of a meel wrhen part of stomach has been removed or the pyloric sphincter mechanism has been disrupted. o Dumping syndrome refers to a constellation of post-prandial symptoms occuring due to accelerated emptying (dumping) of hyperosmolar stomach contents into the small bowel. o It is usually seen in operation which destroy the pyloric sphincter (i. e. gastrectomy, antrectomy and drainage procedures). It also affects a small percentage of patients with highly selective vagotomy due to loss of receptive relaxation of stomach. o It is of 2 types. Early dumping syndrome. It occurs immediately after meals (after about 15 to 30 min). Dumping of hyperosmolar contents into the small bowel results in rapid fluid influx from the circulation into the gastrointestinal tract. This leads to acute intestinal distention and peripheral and splanchnic vasodilation. This gives rise to vasomotor & abdominal symptoms: epigastric fullness, sweating, light headedness, tachycardia, diarrhoea. Symptoms can be ameliorated by lying down or saline infusion. Late dumping syndrome. It is seen late - 2 to 3 hrs after meal. Occurs due to reactive hypoglycemia. The carbohyrate load in the small bowrel causes a rise in plasma glucose, which in turn, causes high insulin levels. Hyperinsulinemia leads to hypoglycemia. Symptoms are relieved by administration of sugar, o Management. Dietary managment. Diet therapy is done to reduce jejunal osmolality. Multiple small meals. Food low in carbohydrate and rich in fat and protein are taken. Liquids during meals should be avoided. Somatostatin analogues (octreotide). Diet therapy is usually successful but if it fails, the patient is started on octreotide. Surgery. Most of the patients improve with time, dietary management and Octreotide. Only rarely surgery is needed, Surgical procedures used to treat dumping are. Pyloric reconstruction, takedown of gastrojejunostomy, interposition of a 10 cm reversed intestinal segment between the stomach & duodenum, conversion of Billroth II to Billroth I anastomosis, and conversion to Roux-en-Y-anastomosis.",
