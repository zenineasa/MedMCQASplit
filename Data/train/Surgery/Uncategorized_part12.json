Prolonged increases in metabolic rate lead to growth of the vasculature; decreases in metabolic rate lead to vascular rarefaction, i. e., loss of capillaries as well as other types of blood vessels. In other words, blood vessels grow where they are needed and regress when they are not needed. When a limb is immobilized in a cast, the muscles are inactive and their metabolic rate decreases. This decrease in metabolic rate leads to a decrease in capillarity in the skeletal muscles by mechanisms that are poorly understood. When the metabolic rate of immobilized skeletal muscle decreases, the oxygen consumption of the muscle decreases, which is likely to cause an initial increase in both myoglobin oxygen saturation and intracellular p.

However \"in 5% of patients, symptoms begin after 40\" - Harrison All other features, i. e. raised ESR, marked stiffness, restriction of chest movements & syndesmophytes are seen in A. S. Syndesmophvtes Syndesmophytes are thin, slender veical radiodense spicules bridging the veebral bodies, giving the spine `bamboo' appearance. They are actually ossification of outer. fibres of annulus fibroses. Syndesmophytes are seen in: - Ankylosing spondylitis - Psoriatic ahritis - Reiter's disease - Ahritis assoc. with Inflammatory bowel disease Before discussing A. S. lets see other options: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH): Also k/a Forestier's disease, ankylosing hyperostosis DISH is a syndrome of excessive calcification and ossification of soft tissues. mainly ligaments and entheses, that develops with aging. There is a marked predilection to the axial skeleton, paicularly the thoracic spine. It may also involve the peripheral joints. The most characteristic radiographic abnormality of DISH is calcification and ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine. The diagnosis is made by, spinal radiographs that show \"flowing\" calcifications along the anterior and lateral poion of at least four contiguous veebral bodies without loss of disc height and without typical radiographic findings of ankylosing spondylitis. (no syndesmophytes). DISH commonly occurs in men in their fifth to sixth decade of life. Patients are often asymptomatic but may have spinal pain or limited spinal motion. DISH can be ruled out as in DISH there is no raised ESR and syndesmophytes. (ESR is raised in inflammatory spondyloahropathies like Ankylosing spondylitis. But DISH and degenerative osteoahritis are non-inflammatory conditions, so ESR would be normal.) Apley's writes- \"Although DISH bears a superficial resemblance to AS, it is not an inflammatory disease; spinal pain and stiffness are seldom severe, the sacroilitis joints are not eroded and the ESR is normal. \" Harrison writes- \"Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis which occurs in middle aged and elderly is usually not symptomatic. \" Degenerative osteoahritis of spine: It is a disease of elderly characterised by formation of large osteophytes along the anterior and lateral aspects of spine with decreased interveebral disc spaces. Lumbar canal stenosis: It is ruled out as - Neurogenic claudication or pseudoclaudication is the usual symptom, consisting of back and buttock or leg pain induced by walking or standing and relieved by sitting.

Ankylosing spondylitis Introduction Prototype of seronegative (absence of rheumatoid factor) spondyloahropathies. Inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. Male to female ratio is 2-3: 1 Strong correlation with HLA-B27 Pathology Enthesitis i. e. inflammation of the inseion points of tendons, ligaments or joint capsule on hone is one of the hallmarks of this entity of disease. Primarily affects axial (spinal) skeleton and sacroiliitis is often the earliest manifestation of A. S.. Involvement of costoveebral joints frequently occur, leading to diminished chest expansion (normal 5 cm) Peripheral joints for e. g. shoulders, and hips (root joints) are also involved in 1/3rd patients. Extraaicular manifestations like acute anterior uveitis (in 5%); rarely aoic valve disease, carditis and pulmonary fibrosis. Pathological changes proceed in three stages? 1). Inflammation with granulation tissue formation and erosion of adjacent bone. 2). Fibrosis of granulation tissue 3). Ossification of the fibrous tissue, leading to ankylosis of the joint. Clinical features Low back pain of insidious onset Duration usually less than 3 months Significant morning stiffness and improvement with exercise Limited chest expansion Diffuse tenderness over the spine and sacroiliac joints Loss of lambar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis Decreased spinal movements (especially extension) in all directions. Radiological features Cardinal and earliest sign is erosion and fuzziness of the sacroiliac joints Squaring of veebral bodies Syndesmophytes (described earlier) giving the appearance of a \"bamboo spine\". Other investigations ESR and CRP are usually elevated HLA-B27 is present in 95% of cases. Treatment General measures to maintain satisfactory posture and preserve movement.

The range of anatomic variants includes duodenal stenosis causing constipation, mucosal web with the intact muscular wall (so-called windsock deformity); two ends separated by a fibrous cord, or complete separation with a gap within the duodenum. Associated Anomalies: DA is associated with several conditions, including prematurity, Down syndrome, maternal polyhydramnios, malrotation, annular pancreas, and biliary atresia. Other anomalies, such as cardiac, renal, esophageal, and anorectal anomalies, are also common. In most cases, the duodenal obstruction is distal to the ampulla of Vater, and infants present with bilious emesis in the neonatal period. In patients with a mucosal web, the symptoms of postprandial emesis may occur later in life. Diagnosis: The classic plain abdominal radiograph of DA is termed the double-bubble sign (air-filled stomach and duodenal bulb, In cases in which there is no distal air, the diagnosis is secured, and no further studies are necessary. On the other hand, if the distal air is present, an upper gastrointestinal contrast study is performed fairly rapidly. This study is important not only to confirm the diagnosis of duodenal stenosis or atresia but also to exclude midgut volvulus, which would constitute a surgical emergency. Treatment: The management of DA is by surgical bypass of the duodenal obstruction as either a side-to-side or proximal transverse-to-distal longitudinal (diamond-shaped) duodenoduodenostomy.",

Traditionally, BE was identified by the presence of columnar mucosa extending at least 3 cm into the esophagus. It is now recognized that the specialized intestinal type epithelium found in the Barrett's mucosa is the only tissue predisposed to malignant degeneration. Consequently, the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is presently made given any length of endoscopically identifiable columnar mucosa that proves on biopsy to show intestinal metaplasia. While long segments of columnar mucosa without metaplasia do occur, they are uncommon and are probably congenital in origin. The hallmark of intestinal metaplasia is the presence of intestinal goblet cells. \"",

Factors that may precipitate obstruction are sudden wt. loss following injury or bum rapid growth in height. - application of body casts - supine immobilization Clinical picture - the syndrome is seen invariably in thin patients - common in young adults, more common in females Symptoms include epigastric bloating and crampy pain after meals, relieved by vomitting or prone position. Investigation - Barium meal study Hypotonic duodenography is superior to barium meal - CT scan with contrast Management Conservative t/t - conservative t/t is successful in most cases associated with ohopedic condition. Treatment usually involves removal of plaster cast and mobilization of patient. - Postural therapy: patient is advised to turn into prone or knee-elbow position after meals or when symptomatic. Surgery - for patients not responding to conservative methods - duodenojejunostomy is done",

In normal subjects (Negative hepatojugular reflux) - Jugular venous pressure rises only transiently with rapid return to the baseline. Positive hepatojugular reflux (Left ventricular, failureQ) - A positive abdominojugular reflux sign is defined by an increase in the jugular venous pressure of greater than 3 cm, sustained for greater than 15 seconds. Explanation Pushing on the liver (or even midabdomen) for about 15 seconds increases the amount of blood returned to the right atrium and right ventricle (increased preload). Concurrently, there is increase in right ventricle afterload, owing to upward movement of the diaphragm which reduces intrathoracic volumes. (Pulmonary aery pressure is increased due to reduced intrathoracic volumes). (Leading to increased right ventricle afterload) In a normal person the jugular venous pressure would rise temporarily and then normalize quickly as the healthy right ventricle pumps out the additional blood i. e. it handles the increase in preload and afterload quite well. A dysfunctioning right ventricle however fails to accept this increase in preload and afterload and therefore there is persistent elevation of systemic venous pressure. The abdominojugular reflux is not specific to any disorder but rather is a reflection of the inability of the right ventricle to accept or reject the transiently increased venous return. \"Positive abdominojugular reflux is most commonly associated with left ventricular failure\". In the absence of left heart failure a positive abdominal jugular reflex sign should prompt consideration of:- Impaired right ventricular proload - A Decrease in right ventricular compliance. - A decrease in right ventricular systolic function or - An elevation in right ventricular afterload.

But in case of Acute promyelocytic leukemia, these drugs are not used, instead Tretinoin is used for induction. It is a well known fact that acute promyelocytic leukemia may lead to D. I. C. When acute promyelocytic leukemia is treated with anthracycline and cytarabine, DIC is induced by the release of granule components of dying tumour cells. Tretinoin does not produce D. I. C., instead it may produces another complication known as retinoic acid syndrome, which occurs in the first 3 weeks of treatment and is characterized by fever, dyspnoea, chest pain, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and pericardial effusions.

Rarely hematemesis may occur. - Peritoneal signs are present in less than half of MVT patients. Diagnosis - Contrast enhanced CT scanning is the diagnostic study of choice. Management Patients with MVT are given adequate fluid resuscitation and anticoagulated with heparin. Urgent laparotomy is indicated for patients with peritoneal findings Nonble bowel along with its mesentry is resected and primary anastomosis done. Viable but suspicious bowel is not resected, but a second look operation is recommended within 24 to 48 hrs. Thrombectomy has not been proved to be successful. However, thrombectomy is indicated if a long segment of nonble bowel is found and the angiogram or operative findings indicate complete thrombosis of SMV. Note that MVT is usually due to thrombosis of small peripheral venous branches. Thrombosis of SMV or IMV is not common.

        "exp": "Ans is 'c' i. e., Arises at the Mesentric border Meckel's diveiculum is situated at the anti-mesenteric border of small intestine. Meckel's diveiculum is a true diveiculum as it has all the 3 layers of the intestine. It's the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. Male to female ratio is 3: 2. Approximately 60% of Meckel's diveicula contain heterotopic mucosa, of which more than 60% consists of gastric mucosa. Second most common ectopic mucosa is that of Pancreas (Pancreatic acini). Other mucosa are -colonic mucosa, Brunner's gland, pancreatic islets, endometriosis and hepatobiliary tissue. A useful but crude Mnemonic used traditionally for describing Meckel's diveicula is Rule of two: i. e. - 2% prevalence - 2 inch in length - 2 feet proximal to ilcocecal valve. half of these who are symptomatic are younger than 2 yrs of age Meckel's diveicula are asymptomatic. Symptoms arise only when any complication occurs. Complications Most common complication in children & young adults (< 18 yrs of age) --> bleeding in adults --> intestinal obstruction overall --> bleeding Following complications are noted in Meckel's diveiculum. (1) Bleeding - bleeding in Meckel's diveiculum is usually the result of ulceration in ileal mucosa adjacent to the diveiculum caused by the acid secreted by heterotopic gastric mucosa within the diveiculum. (2) Intestinal obstruction Intestinal obstruction associated with Meckel's diveiculum can result from several mechanisms. a) Volvulus of the intestine around the fibrous band attaching the diveiculum to the umbilicus b) Intussusception with the diveiculum acting as the lead point. c) Entrapment of intestine by a mesodiveicular band (Mesodiveicular band is a remnant of left vitelline aery, it tethers the Meckel's diveiculum to the ileal mesentry.) d) Stricture secondary to chronic diveiculitis. (3) Diveiculitis - clinical picture is similar to appendicitis. - diveiculitis may lead to perforation. Littre's hernia - rarely Meckel's diveiculum is found in inguinal or femoral hernia. This is known as Littre's hernia. Diagnostic studies Meckel's diveiculum in the absence of bleeding can be rarely diagnosed before surgical intervention. Barium meal follow through can rarely demonstrate the diveiculum. Barium enteroclysis can demonstrate the diveicula in 75% of cases but is avoided during acute presentation of complication. If repeated episodes of lower GI bleed occur and an ectopic gastric mucosa in the Meckel's diveiculum is suspected, it can be demonstrated by Technetium\" peechnate radionuclide scan. It demonstrates the ectopic gastric mucosa and localizes the Meckel's diveiculum. Angiography can localize the site of bleeding during acute hemorrhage related to meckel's diveicula.",

Serum levels of IgA may be elevated. A small percentage of patients may progress to renal failure over a period of years.

Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder in which a thyroid-stimulating IgG immunoglobulin (TSI) binds to the TSH receptors causing increased release of thyroid hormone. The exophthalmos is caused by lymphocytic infiltration of the extraocular muscles. Hashimoto's thyroiditis results in hypothyroidism and is associated with a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland and antimicrosomal antibodies against the thyroid parenchyma. Multinodular toxic goiter causes hypehyroidism, but does not result in exophthalmos. Papillary carcinoma will only very rarely present as a hypersecreting nodule. Most cases will be nonsecreting, cold nodules. There is no exophthalmos. This is the most common thyroid cancer and has the best prognosis of all thyroid cancers. Ref: Cooper D. S., Ladenson P. W.

Factor Ville assay:- Factor Ville or intrinsic factor VIII can be ruled out because its deficiency is associated with bleeding. Platelet aggregation tests:?

Follow up testing is performed to confirm or exclude the presence of lupus anticoagulant:-These may include:- Mixing study - An equal volume of patient plasma is mixed with normal pooled plasma and a PTT or DRVVT is performed on this mixture. The basic principle is that the normal plasma contributes a sufficient amount of clotting factor to correct. for a factor deficiency. - A mixing study that corrects the APTT is characteristic of a coagulation factor where as one that does not correct indicates a factor inhibitor. Correction neutralization (with phospholipids):? - An excess of pho. spholipid is added to the patient sample and APII, DRVVT is performed. - The basic principle behind this is that lupus anticoagulant is directed against phospholipid. Hence phospholipid dependent assays are prolonged. - When excess phospholipid is added it overcomes the LA inhibition and corrects the test.",

The extent of the defect can vary from a mild glandular defect to complete defects as are observed in bladder exstrophy, diastasis of the pubic bones, or both. - In glandular epispadias, the urethra opens on the dorsal aspect of the glans, which is broad and flattened. - In the penile type, the urethral meatus, which is broad and gaping, is located between the pubic symphysis and the coronal sulcus. A distal groove usually extends from the meatus through the splayed glans. - The penopubic type has the urethral opening at the penopubic junction, and the entire penis has a distal dorsal groove extending through the glans. All types of epispadias are associated with varying degrees of dorsal chordee. Females with epispadias have a bifid clitoris and separation of the labia. Male to female ratio of epispadias is 3: 1. Incontinence due to maldevelopment of urinary sphincters is commonly associated with most epispadias except for the glandular type. Other associated anomaly is pubic diastasis as in exstrophy. Surgery is required to correct the incontinence, remove the chordee to straighten the penis, and extend the urethra out onto the glans penis.

It is caused by injury to auriculotemporal nerve, after surgical trauma to the parotid gland. Frey syndrome is thought to be due to aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibers between the otic ganglion and salivary tissue, which leads to innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels. Frey syndrome is reported by approximately 10 percent of patients, although rigorous testing may detect gustatory sweating in as many as 95 percent of patients after parotidectomy. Frey syndrome may occur from two weeks to two years after surgery due to a latency in the regeneration of parasympathetic nerve fibers; the area of involved skin may increase over time. The incidence of Frey syndrome is reduced by minimizing the parotid wound bed, placing fascial grafts between the skin and the gland bed, reconstructive techniques such as thick skin flaps, and postoperative RT. Intracutaneous injection of botulinum toxin A is an effective, well-tolerated, and long-lasting treatment for symptomatic patients; it may be repeated for recurrent symptoms.",

        "exp": "Cooperative bindings Allosteric enzymes, unlike simpler enzymes, do not obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Often, one active site of an allosteric enzyme molecule can positively affect another active site in the same molecule. This leads to cooperativity and sigmoidal enzyme kinetics in a plot of versus. The terms competitive inhibition and noncompetitive inhibition apply to Michaelis-Menten kinetics and not to allosteric enzymes. Allosteric Regulation i. Allosteric enzyme has one catalytic site where the substrate binds and another separate allosteric site where the modifier binds (allo= other) ii. Allosteric and substrate binding sites may or may not be physically adjacent. iii. The binding of the regulatory molecule can either enhance the activity of the enzyme (allosteric activation), or inhibit the activity of the enzyme (allosteric inhibition). iv. In the former case, the regulatory molecule is known as the positive modifier and in the latter case as the negative modifier. v. The binding of substrate to one of the subunits of the enzyme may enhance substrate binding by other subunits. This effect is said to be positive co-operativity. If the binding of substrate to one of the subunits decreases the avidity of substrate binding by other sites, the effect is called negative co-operativity. vi. In most cases, a combination is observed, resulting in a sigmoid shaped curve. vii. Km is usually increased. viii. Vmax is reduced. ix. The effect of allosteric modifier is maximum at or near substrate concentration equivalent to Km. xi. When an inhibitor binds to the allosteric site, the configuration of catalytic site is modified such that substrate cannot bind properly. xii. Most allosteric enzymes possess quaternary structure.

Both agents are viricidal and act by interfering with viral polymerase activity. In the case of herpes simplex virus infection, the virally- coded thymidine kinase monophosphorylates the acyclovir. Cellular kinases then add two more phosphates, creating a nucleotide that is accepted by the virally-coded DNA polymerase. The structural analog is incorporated into the growing DNA chain and elongation is terminated. Ribavirin, used to treat paramyxovirus (respiratory syncytial virus) infection, works by interferring with viral messenger RNA (m. RNA) capping. Amantadine, used to treat influenza A infections, blocks viral un coating. It is most effective when given before viral infection occurs. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e. g., azidothymidine, didioxycytocine, didioxyinosine) directly interfere with normal enzyme activity. These agents are virostatic, and virus growth occurs when the agents are removed. Interferons are induced as a result of viral infection of a cell. Products of viral nucleic acid replication activate genes that code for interferons, which directly prevent virus growth by inducing an antiviral protein within virus- infected cells.",

Albendazole therapy is the mainstay of treatment in the majority of patients with hydatid disease. It is given alone and for prolonged periods of time in patients who are poor candidates for cyst-directed interventions. However, liver-directed treatment is prefered. The treatment of hepatic cysts is primarily surgical. In General, most cysts are treated. Packing off of the abdomen is impoant because rupture can results in anaphylaxis and diffuse seeding. Usually the cyst is then aspirated through a closed suction system and flushed with a scolicidal agent such as hypeonic saline. The cyst is then unroofed, which can be followed by a number of possibilities, such as excision (or pericystectomy), marsupialization procedures, leaving the cysts open, draining of the cyst, omentoplasty, or paial hepatectomy to encompass the cyst. Total pericystectomy or formal paial hepatectomy can also be performed without entering the cysts. In patients with anatomically appropriate lesions, PAIR ( puncture, aspiration, injection, and reaspiration) is the preferred initial treatment. The efficacy of PAIR in managing hydatid cysts is greater than 75%. For patients whose disease is refractory to PAIR, laparoscopic or open complete cyst removal with instillation of a scolicidal agent generally is curative.

A major concept in understanding burn shock is that massive fluid shift occurs even though total body water initially remains unchanged. The volume in each fluid compament changes. Intracellular & interstitial volume increases at the expense of intravascular volume due to increased vascular permeability. Multiple resuscitation formulas, employing various solutions and rate of administration are used. These formulae are used for initial management after burn. The response is monitored tthrough urine output a justments made acc or in For burned children, formulae have to be modified as a child with a comparable burn to that of an adult requires more resucitation fluid per kilogram. Another modification for burned children is addition of glucose based maintenance fluid or else profound hypoglycemia will ensue owing to minimal glycogen reserve.

Methylene blue > Toluidine blue \"Chromoendoscopy, the intravital staining of gastrointestinal epithelia, provides additional diagnostic information with respect to the epithelial morphology and pathophysiology. Based on experience gathered mainly in Japan, chromoendoscopy is now in more widespread use, in paicular to identify preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. The most promising techniques are the depiction of squamous epithelium neoplasia of the esophagus with Lugol's solution, staining of Barrett's mucosa by methylene blue, including the potential to identify neoplasia, and the demarcation of neoplasia with indigo carmine in stomach and colon for local endoscopic resection. \"- aicle: Chromoendoscopy: From a Research Tool to Clinical Progress U. Peitz, P. Malfeheiner at website: ikel. Nr=67480 \"Chromoendoscopy involves the use of agents that enhance the distinction between diseased and normal mucosa, either by filling surface cervices or by differential uptake by diseased epithelium. Many chromoendoscopy agents have been studied in the detection of esophageal carcinoma, of which Lugol's iodine and methylene blue have been most widely studied. \"- Carcinoma of the Esophagus By Sheila C. Rankin p. 31 Chromoendoscopy involves the use of stains or dyes during endoscopy to improve the visualization and characterization of the gastrointestinal mucosa. The stains are mainly Vital dyes- Lugol's solution, methylene blue, and toluidine blue or Contrast agents- indigo carmine and dilute acetic acid solution Lugol's solution Is absorbed by glycogen containing, nonketatinized squamous epithelium. Lugol's stained tissue will characteristically turn green-brown. Any condition that depletes glycogen, including inflammation, dysplasia, and early-stage cancer, will result in an absence of uptake of the dye. Lugol's iodine is used to determine the extent of BE, and to screen for squamous esophageal cancer in high-risk populations. Methylene blue dye is taken up by the cytoplasm or absorptive cells such as the normal epithelial cells of the colon and small intestine, and goblet cells, which are present in Barrett's epithelium. It will not stain nonabsorptive normal epithelium of the stomach as is found in the cardia and fundus, or normal squamous mucosa of the esophagus. Chromoendoscopy with methylene blue has been used to screen for colonic neoplasia, to diagnose BE and to screen for areas of precursor lesions and carcinoma in the stomach. Methylene blue stains barrett's epithelium as it is taken up by the cytoplasm of goblet cells. Dysplastic change is associated with a reduction in goblet cell numbers and an increasing nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio propoional to the degree of dysplasia, and such tissues absorb methylene blue to a lesser extent than surrounding cells. Increasing grades of dysplasia may appear as heterogeneous or unstained areas, allowing targeted rather than random biopsies to be taken and have been repoed to improve the detection of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. Indigo carmine Unlike Lugol's iodine or methylene blue, indigo carmine is not taken up by tissues but instead pools in crevices between epithelial cells, thereby highlighting small lesions or irregularities in the mucosal architecture. Chromodendoscopy with indigo carmine has been used to diagnose BE, and to investigate polypoid and nonpolypoid lesion in the colon. Toluidine Blue Toluidine blue stains cellular nuclei. When applied topically it preferentially identifies malignant and inflammatory tissues, in pa because of their greater nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. It has most commonly been used for the identification of early squamous esophageal cancer.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: USG Plain Radiography: - Abdominal radiographs are usually not indicated, as most gallstones are not radio-opaque. - Chest radiographs may be performed to exclude a thoracic cause of pain and bowel perforation. Ultrasound: - Initial investigation of choice for suspected acute cholecystitis. Ultrasonographic signs of acute gallbladder inflammation include gallbladder wall thickening/oedema, pericholecystic fluid, gallstones, and positive ultrasonic Murphy's sign. - >90% diagnostic accuracy and varies with the morphologic criteria used. - Colour/power Doppler increases accuracy over Gray-scale sonography. - Advantages: allows evaluation of other abdominal structures (can identify an alternative diagnosis), provides preoperative information such as gallbladder size, stone size, gallbladder wall status, and the presence of biliary dilatation. Tc-IDA Radionuclide Scan: - Superior diagnostic accuracy and specificity compared to ultrasound. Used to clarify a negative, equivocal or technically difficult ultrasound in the presence of continued clinical suspicion of acute cholecystitis. - The hallmark of acute cholecystitis (acalculus as well as calculus) is persistent gall bladder non-visualisation 30 minutes post morphine or on the 3-4 hour delayed image. - False positives can occur in alcoholics, intensive care unit patients, patients on prolonged fasting, cystic fibrosis and chronic cholecystitis. - Morphine augmentation reduces false positives and is superior to delayed imaging. - In critically ill patients in whom acalculous cholecystitis is suggested on US, Tc-IDA scan with pretreatment cholecystokinin to empty gallbladder prior to Tc-IDA scan, or percutaneous cholecystostomy may be indicated. Post treatment Cholecystokinin can be used to evaluate gallbladder function in chronic cholecystitis. Limitations: longer examination time, unreliable in severe hepatocellular disease or at serum bilirubin levels >340-500 mmol/L, and inability to diagnose extra-biliary causes of acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain and to provide anatomical information. Other Imaging: Endoscopy or Barium studies may be indicated in ceain patients to identify alternative diagnoses which may clinically simulate acute cholecystitis. - Computed Tomography CT is useful when the clinical picture is non-specific as it can detect other intra-abdominal inflammatory processes, and when complications of acute cholecystitis are suspected. Sensitivities for CT diagnosis of acute cholecystitis have not been established CT features of acute cholecystitis include Pericholecystic inflammatory changes, including contrast enhancement of the liver adjacent to the gallbladder, inflammatory stranding of pericholecystic tissues, and pericholecystic fluid. Loss of distinction between walls of the gallbladder and adjacent liver. Gallbladder wall thickening, contrast enhancement. Gallbladder distension. Presence of gallstones. Advantages: allows other diagnoses, able to identify complications of acute cholecystitis. Limitations: exposure to ionising radiation, less sensitive (57%-88%) for detection of gallstones compared to ultrasound.",

        "question": "30 yrs female presented with unilateral breast cancer associated with axillary lymph node enlargement. Modified radical mastectomy was done, a further treatment plan will be",
        "exp": "Stage I & II breast cancers (Early invasive breast cancers ) are managed by 1. Primary therapy for local management 2. Adjuvant therapy Primary therapy consists of: Mastectomy with an assessment of axillary lymph node status (or modified radical mastectomy) or Breast conservation (lumpectomy, wide local excision or quadrantectomy) with an assessment of axillary lymph node status + radiotherapy. Various trials have found both these methods to be equally effective. Breast conservation is the preferred form of treatment because of cosmetic advantages. However, there are certain contraindications for conservative surgery (described in subsequent question) Management of axillary lymph nodes Earlier dissection of axillary lymph nodes (level I and II) was performed to assess the lymph node status (i. e. presence or absence of occult metastasis). Now Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered the standard for evaluation of the axillary lymph nodes for metastasis in women who have clinically negative lymph nodes, (the sentinel lymph node is thirst regional lymph node to receive tumor cells that metastasize along the lymphatic pathway from the primary breast cancer). Axillary Lymph node dissection is performed for clinically palpable axillary lymph nodes or metastatic disease detected in sentinel lymph node biopsy. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node-negative cancers if > 1 cm in size. Node-negative cancer >. 5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion high nuclear grade high histological grade HER 2/neuoverexpression negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive tumors. HER-2/neu expression is determined for all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and may be used to provide prognostic information in patients with node-negative breast cancer and predict the relative efficacy of various chemotherapy regimens. Trastuzumab is the HER-2/neu-targeted agent that is added to the adjuvant therapy is the tumor shows overexpression of HER-2/neu receptors. Advanced Local-Regional Breast Cancer (Stage III ) (Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + MRM + adjuvant radiation therapy + chemotherapy + antiestrogen therapy) Here the disease is advanced on the chest wall or in regional lymph nodes (or both), with no evidence of metastasis to distant sites. Such patients are recognized to be at significant risk for the development of subsequent metastases, and treatment addresses the risk for both local and systemic relapse. In an effort to provide optimal local-regional disease-free survival as well as distant disease-free survival for these women, surgery is integrated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (administration of therapeutic agents prior to the main treatment) should be considered in the initial management of all patients with locally advanced stage III breast cancer. Surgical therapy for women with stage III disease is usually a modified radical mastectomy, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Antiestrogen therapy (tamoxifen) is added for hormone receptor-positive tumors. Chemotherapy is used to maximize distant disease-free survival, whereas radiation therapy is used to maximize local-regional disease-free survival. In selected patients with stage IIIA cancer, neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy can reduce the size of primary cancer and permit breast-conserving surgery. Distant Metastases (Stage IV ) (mainly palliative treatment) Treatment for stage IV breast cancer is not curative but may prolong survival and enhance a woman's quality of life. Hormonal therapies that are associated with minimal toxicity are preferred to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Appropriate candidates for initial hormonal therapy include women with hormone receptor-positive cancers; women with bone or soft tissue metastases only; and women with limited and asymptomatic visceral metastases. Systemic chemotherapy is indicated for women with hormone receptor-negative cancers, symptomatic visceral metastases, and hormone-refractory metastases. Bisphosphonates, which may be given in addition to chemotherapy or hormone therapy, should be considered in women with bone metastases. About Adjuvant Therapy, Adjuvant therapy is the use of systemic therapy (chemotherapy or/and hormone therapy) in patients who have received local therapy but are at risk of relapse. The objective is to eliminate the occult metastasis responsible for late recurrences while they are microscopic and theoretically most vulnerable to anticancer agents. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node-negative cancers if > 1 cm in size node-negative cancer >. 5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion high nuclear grade high histological grade HER 2/neuover expression negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive. The use of chemotherapy in postmenopausal women is controversial. In postmenopausal women, chemotherapy is frequently used upto age 70 yrs, if she can tolerate it. In older women, chemotherapy is performed less frequently. In estrogen-positive tumors, in postmenopausal women, antiestrogen (tamoxifen / aromatase inhibitors) Therapy is the preferred form of adjuvant systemic treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy it involves the administration of adjuvant therapy before primary therapy (surgery & radiation therapy) it has shown to down-stage the tumor. Previously CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate & 5 - fluorouracil) was the chemotherapeutic regimen of choice. \"CMF is no longer considered adequate adjuvant chemotherapy and modem regimens include an anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) and the newer agents such as the taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel)\"- Bailey and Love 25/e p844 Anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy. (Trastuzumab) HER-2/neu expression for all newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer is now recommended. Trastuzumab is added to the chemotherapy for tumors overexpressing HER-2/neu receptors (Trastuzumab is added along with taxanes).",

Heredity-It is more likely in people who have close relatives with cancer. Tobacco smoking and heavy alcohol use increase the risk. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its resultant Barrett's esophagus increase esophageal cancer risk due to the chronic irritation of the mucosal lining (adenocarcinoma is more common in this condition, while all other risk factors predispose more for squamous cell carcinoma). Human papillomavirus (HPV) Paicular dietary substances, such as nitrosamine. Plummer-Vinson syndrome (anemia and esophageal webbing) Tylosis and Howel-Evans syndrome (hereditary thickening of the skin of the palms and soles). Radiation therapy for other conditions in the mediastinum. Celiac disease predisposes towards squamous cell carcinoma. Carcinoma may develop at the achalasia segment due to persistent retention esophagitis as a result of fermentation of food residues. The location of the tumor is generally measured by the distance from the teeth. The esophagus (25 cm or 10 inches long) is commonly divided into three pas for purposes of determining the location. Adenocarcinomas tend to occur distally and squamous cell carcinomas proximally, but the converse may also be the case. Worldwide squamous cell carcinoma is most common whereas adenocarcinomas predominates in the west. Squamous cell carcinomas are similar to head and neck cancer in their appearance and association with tobacco and alcohol consumption.

Trastuzumab is added to the chemotherapy for tumors overexpressing HER-2/neu receptors. (Trastuzumab is added along with taxanes) About Adjuvant Therapy Adjuvant therapy is the use of systemic therapy (chemotherapy or/and hormone therapy) in patients who have received local therapy but are at risk of relapse. The objective is to eliminate the occult metastasis responsible for late recurrences while they are microscopic and theoretically most vulnerable to anticancer agents. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node negative cancers if > 1 cm in size node negative cancer >. 5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion - high nuclear grade - high histological grade - HER 2/neu overexpression - negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive. The use of chemotherapy in post-menopausal women is controversial. - In post menopausal women, chemotherapy is frequently used upto age 70 yrs, if she can tolerate it. - In older women, chemotherapy is performed less frequently. - In estrogen positive tumors, in postmenopausal women, antiestrogen (tamoxifen/ aromatase inhibitors) therapy is the preferred form of adjuvant systemic treatment.

Locking occurs as a result of medial rotation of the femur during the last stage of extension. The anteroposterior diameter of the lateral femoral condyle is less than that of the medial condyle. As a result, when the lateral condylar aicular surface is fully 'used up' by extension, pa of the medial condylar surface remains unused. At this stage the lateral condyle rotates backwards, i. e. medial rotation of the femur occurs, so that the remaining pa of the media condylar surface is also 'taken up'. This movement locks the knee joint. Locking is aided by the oblique pull of ligaments during the last stages of extension. When the knee is locked, it is completely rigid and all ligaments of the joint are taut. Locking is produced by continued action of the same muscles that produce extension, i. e. the quadriceps femoris, especially the vastus medialis pa. The locked knee joint can be flexed only after it is unlocked by a reversal of the medial rotation, i. e. by lateral rotation of the femur.

Unlike conventional endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), MRCP does not require contrast material to be administered into the ductal system.

The etiology is slippage of the head of the radius under the annular ligament. The distal attachment of the annular ligament covering the radial head is weaker in children than in adults, allowing it to be more easily torn. As children age, the annular ligament strengthens, making the condition less common. The oval shape of the proximal radius in cross-section contributes to this condition by offering a more acute angle posteriorly and laterally, with less resistance to slippage of the ligament when axial traction is applied to the extended and pronated forearm. The patient resists supination/pronation as well as flexion/extension of the forearm. Axial traction is the most common cause of nursemaid elbow. A fall is the second most common mechanism of injury. Infants have been repoed with nursemaid elbow after rolling over or being assisted to roll over.

The glyceraldehyde is phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by triose kinase, and both triose phosphates can enter glycolysis. Excess fructose from commercial foods can exercise adverse effects by raising blood lipids and uric acid. Fructose phosphorylation bypasses phosphofructokinase, a regulatory enzyme of glycolysis and provides excess glycerol metabolites and excess triglyceride lipid biosynthesis. Fructose phosphorylation can also deplete liver cell ATP, lessening its inhibition of adenine nucleotide degradation and increasing production of uric acid.

Age: Risk increases with age between the third and eighth decades.

Nulliparous women is more prone for breast carcinoma. Personal history of breast cancer: This factor depends on patient age at time of diagnosis. Risk is increased for younger women. Noninvasive carcinoma (ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)/lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)) on previous biopsy: This also is a marker for development of invasive lesions. Benign proliferative changes with atypical hyperplasia: These may increase relative risk by 4 times. Early menarche and late menopause: These also are associated weakly with increased relative risk of breast cancer. Menopausal hormone replacement therapy: the combination use of estrogen with progestin has been associated with an greater risk of breast cancer, paicularly of lobular carcinoma. Increased risk is also related to increased duration of use; this risk can be reduced over time, following the termination of hormone replacement therapy. Family history: Degree of relativity of the family member with breast cancer affects individual risk.

Analysis of large series of patients suggests that a number of those who died would not have done so if operations had been performed earlier and more often. \"",

        "question": "Treatment of choice for 3rd degree hemorrhoids is: September 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Hemorrhoidectomy. External hemorrhoids develop around the rim of the anus. External hemorrhoids cause most of the symptoms associated with hemorrhoids (pain, burning, and itching) because the skin around them is very sensitive. If an external hemorrhoid becomes strangulated, a clot can form in it and become an excruciatingly painful thrombosed hemorrhoid. Internal hemorrhoids develop inside the passageway of the anus. Internal hemorrhoids are often present without causing any discomfo or even awareness of their presence. Internal hemorrhoids are usually painless, although they sometimes cause discomfo and bleeding if a hard stool rubs against them during a bowel movement. Internal hemorrhoids also may prolapse outside the anus, where they appear as small, grape-like masses. These can be painful. Internal hemorrhoids are classified by the degree of tissue prolapse into the anal canal: First-degree - hemorrhoids that bleed but do not prolapse. Second-degree - hemorrhoids that prolapse with straining or defecating and retract on their own. Third-degree - hemorrhoids that prolapse and require manual reduction. Fouh-degree - hemorrhoids that chronically prolapse and, if reducible, fall out again. Management: Rubber band ligation - A rubber band is placed around the base of the hemorrhoid inside the rectum. The band cuts off circulation, and the hemorrhoid withers away within a few days. Sclerotherapy is one of the oldest forms of treatment. A chemical solution is injected directly into the hemorrhoid or the area around it. This solution causes a local reaction that interferes with blood flow inside the hemorrhoid, making the hemorrhoid shrink. Laser or electro-coagulation techniques - Both techniques use special devices to burn hemorrhoidal tissue.- Cryotherapy uses cold temperatures to obliterate the veins and cause inflammation and scarring. It is more time consuming, associated with more posttreatment pain, and is less effective than other treatments. Therefore, this procedure is not commonly used.- Hemorrhoidectomy - Occasionally, extensive or severe internal or external hemorrhoid may require removal by surgery known as hemorrhoidectomy. This is the best method for permanent removal of hemorrhoid. Hemorrhoidectomy is the treatment for: Severe third-degree and fouh-degree hemorrhoids. Second degree hemorrhoids that have not been cured with conservative measures. Fibrosed hemorrhoids. Interno-externo hemorrhoids when the external hemorrhoid is well defined.",

Hot - a hot nodule is one that takes up isotope, while the surrounding thyroid tissue is inactive because the hot nodule is producing such high levels of thyroid hormones that TSH secretion is suppressed. Warm nodule - a warm nodule takes up isotope and so does normal thyroid tissue around it. Cold nodule - it takes up no isotope. The cold nodules carry a higher risk for malignancy. But a 'cold' nodule does not necessarily mean malignant. Only 20% of cold nodules turn out to be malignant, and about 5% of hot nodules can be malignant. Thus routine isotope scanning is no longer used to distinguish benign from malignant. FNAC is the investigation of choice for solitary thyroid nodule. The finding of a malignant diagnosis on FNAC is associated with a high accuracy rate (-100%), but false negative rate of FNAC is high (1-6%). Thus benign nodules should be kept under observation. An inconclusive FNA needs aggressive management. A repeat FNA is done. If still inconclusive, the pt. can be kept under observation if risk factors are low. Alternatively, if risk factors are high as in the present case, the pt. can undergo hemithyroidectomy to remove the nodule and sent for histopathology. Age and underlying medical condition are also taken into consideration while deciding course of management.

Extended lymph node dissections for the treatment of gastric cancer have best been described by the Japanese, and subsequently the JCGC D categories are used to define the extent of lymphatic dissection performed. In the JCGC (Japanese classification of gastric cancer) system, lymph node basins are numbered and subsequently grouped according to the location of the primary. These are grouped into 3 levels: N1, N2 & N3. The nodal stations defined as level NI, N2, and N3 vary depending on the location of the tumor. In general, N1 nodes are within 3 cm of the tumor, N2 nodes are along the hepatic and splenic aeries, and N3 nodes are the most distant. A D1 gastrectomy refers to the removal of NI lymph nodes, D2 gastrectomy to dissection of 1\\\\11 and N2, and D3 resection to a D2 resection plus removal of para-aoic lymph nodes.",

An erect film may subsequently be requested when fuher doubt exists\" Other investigations which may be done are: CT scan - CT is useful in cases in which diagnosis is not readily apparent by plain abdominal film, or if an abdominal tumor or abscess is suspected to be the cause of obstruction. - CT is helpful in identifying the location and cause of obstruction. Barium studies A barium enema is done if a large bowel obstruction is suspected. Barium studies for small bowel obstructions are - Barium meal follow through (BMFT) - Enteroclysis (small bowel enema) - these studies are done in patients in whom a recurring or low-grade mechanical obstruction is suspected. - these studies are contraindicated in acute obstructions - Bailey 24/e, p 1190 - BMFT & enteroclysis are also contraindicated in large bowel obstruction as barium may get insipissated in the colon.",

The term bezoars derives from the Arabic word Badzehr, which means antidote. Bezoars were used as antidotes and as magical medicinal agents against plague, snake-bite, sexual weakness, leprosy and epilepsy by physicians from 12th to 18th century. It can be trichobezoar or hairball, phytobezoar (food paicles/vegetable matter), trichphytobezoar (mixed), pharmacobezoar, lactobezoar, mycobezoar or pseudobezoar. Generally trichobezoars are in the stomach, but it may descend from the stomach into the intestine as far down as transverse colon termed as Rapunzel syndrome. The common presentation is as mobile and well defined lumps. They may present with malaise, weight loss, vague abdominal pain related to meals, anorexia, halitosis, vomiting, wasting and cachexia. They may cause a number of complications including gastritis, occult blood loss and secondary anemia, ulceration, perforation, obstruction, hemorrhage and intussusception. Diagnosis of trichobezoars rest on the clinical evidence of long standing trichophagy, abdominal mass and radiological investigations or CT scan and abdominal ultrasound but obtaining pieces of matted hair through endoscope is pathognomonic. Surgical removal at laparotomy or laparoscopeically is the treatment of choice. If small, they may be removed endoscopically. Biopsy devices, water jets, bezotomes and LASER devices may be used to fragment larger bezoars and lavaged out of the stomach. Counseling by a psychiatrist has an impoant role in the management to prevent recurrence. In any young girl, presenting with epigastric pain, vomiting and abdominal mass, trichbezoars should be considered as differential diagnosis",

        "exp": "Dyscalculia The human brain appears fairly symmetrical anatomically between the left and right hemisphere and many basic sensory and motor. functions in the brain are distributed symmetrically. Homologous regions of cerebral coex on either side of the brain are connected to each other long association, fibres carried by the corpus collosum. For some unknown reasons, however there are marked asvmmetry in several brain functions. The most obvious asymmetry in the cerebral function is the language. In most individuals the language function depends predominantly on the left hemisphere. The left hemisphere is dominant for the language in over 95% of right handers and in over 60-70% of left handers therefore it is called the dominant hemisphere. The core structures associated with language situated in the left hemisphere are Wernicke's areaQ and Broca's area. Other impoant. functions associated with the dominant hemispheredeg (left) are detailed analytical abilities and complex motor planning activities (praxias) The right hemisphere is the non dominant hemisphere of the brain as it does not play dominant role in language. The non-dominant hemisphere is specialized. for ceain nonverbal function and appears to be generally, more impoant for complex visual spatial skills, for impaing emotional significance to events and for music perception. However now the concept of cerebral dominance and a dominant and non-dominant hemisphere has been replaced by a concept of complementary specialization of the hemispheres. Because the hemisphere that is not concerned with language is not simply less developed or \"non-dominant\" instead, it is specialized in the area of spatiotemporal relations. It is this hemisphere that is concerned, for example with the identification of objects by their form and the recognition of musical themes. It also plays a primary role in the recognition of faces. So, the cerebral hemispheres are now divided by the concept of:- Categorical hemisphere Representational hemisphere Lesions in: Categorical hemisphere - Representational hemisphere --a One. for sequential analytical process and language One. for visuospatial relations Produce language clisorderQ AstereognosisQ, AgnosiaQ The language disorder produced due to lesion in the categorical hemisphere depends upon the areas involved in the categorical hemisphere Wernicke's aphasia - Empty meaningless' and full of nonsensical paraphasic errors (&t of Wernicke 's area) Normal fluency Broca 'saphasia -4 Decreased Fluency and spared comprehension, (d/t Broca's area) Function of left Functions of the right hemisphere (categorical) hemisphere (representative).
