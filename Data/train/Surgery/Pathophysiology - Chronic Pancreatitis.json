        "exp": "ANSWER: (D) Gall bladder stone is the most common cause. REF: Schwartz 9th ed chapter 33, Sabiston 18th ed chapter 55. Option (A): In chronic pancreatitis, acinar tissue loss and replacement by fibrosis is greater than the degree of loss of islet tissue, although islets are typically smaller than normal and may be isolated from their surrounding vascular network by the fibrosis. With progressive destruction of the gland, endocrine insufficiency commonly occurs. Frank diabetes is seen initially in about 20% of patients with chronic pancreatitis, and impaired glucose metabolism can be detected in up to 70% of patients. Option (B): Schwartz 9 th ed Table 33-13 Complications of Chronic Pancreatitis. Intrapancreatie complications. Extrapancreatic complications. Pseudocysts. Duodenal or gastric obstruction. Thrombosis of splenic vein. Abscess. Perforation. Erosion into visceral artery. Inflammatory mass in head of pancreas. Bile duct stenosis. Portal vein thrombosis. Duodenal obstruction. Duct strictures and/or stones. Ductal hypertension and dilatation. Pancreatic carcinoma. Pancreatic duct leak rvith ascites or fistula. Pseudocyst extension beyond lesser sac into mediastinum, retroperitoneum, lateral pericolic spaces, pelvis, or adjacent viscera. Option (C); Painful chronic pancreatitis can be treated with resection of the body and tail of the pancreas (distal pancreatectomy), resection of the head and uncinate process of the pancreas (Whipple procedure), subtotal pancreatectomy that spares a rim of pancreas along the inner curve of the duodenum, or total pancreatectomy. Option (D): Worldwide, alcohol consumption and abuse is associated with chronic pancreatitis in up to 70% of cases. Schwartz 9th ed Table 33-6 Etiology of Chronic Pancreatitis.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Pseudocyst \" Pseudocysts occur in up to 10% of patients with acute pancreatitis, and in 20 to 38% of patients with chronic pancreatitis, and thus, they comprise the most common complication of chronic pancreatitis \", -- Schwartz 9/e pi200. Pancreatic Pseudocysto Pancreatic pseudocyst is collection of pancreatic fluid surrounded by a nonepithelialized wall of granulation tissue and fibrosis. o Most common cause of pancreatic pseudocyst is Pancreatitis (90%). The second most common cause is trauma (10%). o Pseudocysts are seen in both acute and chronic pancreatitis. o Most common causes of acute pancreatitis in children include: Blunt abdominal injuries, Mumps and other viral illnesses. Congenital anomalieso Management of Pancreatic Pseudocvsto A pancreatic pseudocvst may resolve spontaneously so it is followed with serial ultrasound studies, o Indications of Surgical intervention: (Ref: Bailey and Love 25/e 1145; CSDT 13/ep583; Harrison 17/e p). Age of cyst more than 12 weeks without resolution. Size of cyst greater than 6 cm. Symptomaticiv) Development of complications (eg. haemorrhage, perforation, g. i. obstruction). But note that these indications for intervention arejust a generalization usedfor teaching the undergraduates. These are not specific indications for interventions. Therapeutic interventions are advised (irrespective of size and duration) when. The pseudocyst is symptomatic or. Increasing is size on follow up studies, or. Any complication (rupture, hemorrhage, or abscess) arise or. There is suspicion of malignancy. Thus expectan t management is adequate (irrespective of size) if the patient is asymptomatic and serial u/s studies show that the cyst is resolving, o Surgical methods. Internal Drainage: most preferred surgical management in uncomplicated pseudocyst is internal drainage. The three options are: Cystojejunostomy. Cystogastrostomy. Cystoduodenostomy. Internal drainage can be done either open surgical or laparoscopic or by percutaneous catheter-based methods (transgastric puncture and stent placement to create a cystogastrostomy). Excision of Pseudocvst - Is hardly done and is usually limited to pseudocyst involving the tail of the pancreas. External drainage-Is done in:-Infected pseudocyst. For immature pseudocyst with thin nonfibrous walls that does not allow safe internal drainage. In an unstable pt. in whom more complex surgical intervention is precluded. Transp a pillary pancreatic duct stent: Because pseudocysts often communicate with the pancreatic ductal system, two newer approaches to pseudocyst management are based on main duct drainage, rather than pseudocyst drainage per se. A stent is passed into the pseudocyst through the papilla of Vater. this drainage, particularly when incomplete, can allow bacteria to enter the pseudocyst and lead to development of an infected pseudocyst. Another transpapillary approach involves placing a stent across the duct defect rather than into the cyst through the defect. By excluding pancreatic juice from the pseudocyst, this bridging intraductal stent may permit the duct disruption to heal and the pseudocyst to resolve without drainage (analogous to the use of common bile duct stents in the setting of a cystic duct leak).",
