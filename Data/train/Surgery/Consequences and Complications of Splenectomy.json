Group A streptococcuso Common Protozoan inf. after splenectomy are: Babesia. Ehrlichia. Malariao No increased risk of viral infection has been noted with splenectomy. o Reason for increased infection. This occurs because the spleen looses its ability to filter and phagocytose bacteria and parasitized blood cells. Splenectomy also results in loss of significant source of antibody production. o Also knowo Hematological effect of splenectomy -Immediatley after splenectomy. Leucocytosis. Thrombocytosis# These levels return to normal within 2-3 weeks. Chronic manifestations. Anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. Howell jelly bodies (nuclear remnants). Heinz bodies (denatured hemoglobin). Basophilic stipling and occasional nucleated erythrocyteo Contraindication to splenectomy: presence of marrow failure: here the enlarged spleen is the only source of hematopoietic tissue.",
