        "exp": "Ans. D. Prostatic cancer. (Ref. Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 98; 1352)Gleason scoreAdenocarcinomas are also often classified as Gl, 2 or 3, but prostate cancer is an exception with widespread use of the Gleason system. The Gleason system grades prostate cancer according to the degree of differentia- tion of the two most prevalent architectural patterns. The final score is the sum of the two grades and can vary from 2 (1 + 1) to 10 (5 + 5). With the higher scores indicating poorer prognosis.A classification of the histological pattern based on the degree of glandular de-differentiation and its relation to stroma has been devised by Gleason. Prostate cancers exhibit heterogeneity within tissue, and so two histological areas of prostate are each scored between 1 and 5. The scores are added to give an overall Gleason score of between 2 and 10; this (and the volume of the cancer) appears to correlate well with the likelihood of spread and the prognosis.Educational points:Treatment and stage of Ca prostate:# Treatment options for prostate cancer depend on stage of disease, life expectancy of the patient and patient preference# PSA, DRE and biopsy Gleason grade are used to predict pathological stage# Localised cancer can be treated by radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy and active monitoring# Treatment of advanced disease is palliative, and hormone ablation remains the first-line therapy",

Secretion of intermediate peptide growth factors also plays a part.Pathology - Affects both glandular epithelium & connective tissue stroma to variable degrees.Adenosis, epitheliosis and stromal proliferation on different proportions.Zonal or surgical division of prostate3 distinct zonesa) The peripheral zone - 70% volume of young adult prostate (Ca Prostate commonly arise here)b) The central zone - 25%c) The transition zone - 5% (BPH most commonly arise here)Medical management of BPHa) a-Adrenergic blockers - e.g.; Prazosin. Terazosin (al blockers) & Tamsulosin (a la blocker). Activation of al receptors in the bladder neck, prostrate & urethra increase their smooth muscle tone, their blockade relaxes these structures, reducing the dynamic obstruction & increasing the urine flow rate.b) 5 a reductase inhibitor - e.g.; Finasteride.Prevent conversion of testosterone to more active dihydrotestosterone responsible for androgenic action in many tissues including prostrate. It results in reduction in size of gland and improvement in symptoms. 6 months therapy is required.Notes - a- blockers afford faster and greater symptomatic relief than finasteride.Absolute indications for surgical treatment of BPH# Refractory urine retention (failing at least one attempt at catheter removal).# Recurrent UTI from BPH.# Bladder stones due to BPH.# Renal insufficiency due to BPH.# Larger bladder diverticula secondary to BPH.# Recurrent gross hematuria from BPH.",
