        "question": "In a patient presenting with a swelling of the thyroid, the radionuclide scan showed a cold nodule and the ultrasound showed a non cystic solid mass. The management of this patient would be:-",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e. Hemithyroidectomy. A discrete solid swelling of the thyroid is mostly treated surgically by hemithyroidectomy. Biopsy of the resected segment is performed and if carcinoma found a total or near total thyroidectomy is done. A cystic swelling is treated by aspiration and surgery is performed only if it recurs or cytology is suspicious of malignancy. A discrete thyroid swelling is: malignant in 15% of cases. a follicular adenoma in 30-40% of cases. remainder are non-neoplastic i. e. colloidal degeneration, cysts or thyroiditis. Thus most of the discrete thyroid swelling are non-neoplastic and benign, still surgery Is the mainstay of treatment because of the risk of leaving a malignant nodule. Role of Isotope scan. An isotope scan divides thyroid swellings into - 'Hot', 'Warm' and 'Cold' nodule. Hot rules out malignancy. Cold favours malignancy and. Warm in equivocal. Even though cold nodule favours malignancy only a very small percentage of them (~ 15%) turn out to be malignant, so isotope scanning is of very little use in distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant swellings and is rather obsolete now. Eltroxin for TSH suppression is used only for a small number of cases. It is tried for 6-12 months. If the swelling regresses, well and good. If it does not surgery is performed.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. Surgical removal This girl is having thyroglossal cyst. Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common congenital cysts in the neck. They are also the most common midline swelling in the neck Thyroglossal cyst. It is cystic swelling developed in the remnant of the thyroglossal duct or tract. Site - It may be present in any part of the thyroglossal tract (thyroglossal tract extends from foramen caecum to the isthmus of thyroid). Common sites are: Subhyoid (most common). In the region of the thyroid cartilages, Suprahyoid. In the floor of mouth. Beneath the foramen caecum. It is a midline swelling, except in the region of the thyroid cartilage, where the thyroglossal tract is pushed to one side, usually to the left. Though it's a congenital swelling most common age of presentation is between 2 to 4 yrs. Mobility - Cyst can be moved sideways but not vertically. Peculiar characteristic which helps in distinguishing thyroglossal cyst from other neck swellingit moves up with protrusion of tongue as the thyroglossal tract is attached to the tongue. It also moves with deglutition so do all thyroid swellings, subhyoid bursitis, sublingual desmoid. Cyst is lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium and squamous epithelium. Heterotopic thyroid tissue may be present in 20% of cases. Complications. Recurrent infection, Formation of thyroglossal fistula. Carcinomatous change (usually papillary carcinoma.). Treatment - Treatment involves the \"Sistrunk operation\" which consists of compete excision of the cyst in continuity with its tract, the central portion of the hyoid bone, and the tissue above the hyoid bone extending to the base of the tongue. Failure to remove these tissues results in a high recurrence rate. Note-Thyroglossal cyst is congenital but thyroglossal fistula is never congenital. It follows infection or inadequate removal of a thyroglossal cyst.",
