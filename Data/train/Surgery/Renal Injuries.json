        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Conservative. REF: Sabistons text book 18th ed chapter 72. More than 98% of all renal injuries can be managed non-operatively. More often, high- grade renal injuries (grades IV and V) require surgical management; however, with proper staging of the renal injury and ca. REFul patient selection, even these injuries can be managed non-operatively. Indications for renal exploration after trauma can be separated into absolute and relative. Absolute indications -evidence of persistent renal bleeding, expanding perirenal hematoma, and pulsatile perirenal hematoma. Relative indications include urinary extravasation, nonviable tissue, delayed diagnosis of arterial injury, segmental arterial injury, and incomplete staging. When surgical exploration for renal trauma is indicated, it is recommended to use a trans abdominal approach and early exploration of the renal hilum and vasculature before exploring the retroperitoneum.",
