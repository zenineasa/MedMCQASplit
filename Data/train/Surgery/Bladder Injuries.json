Extraperitoneal bladder ruptureo Extraperitoneal rupture is the most common type of bladder injury, accounting for ~85% (range 80-90%) of cases. It is usually the result of pelvic fractures or penetrating trauma. Cystography reveals a variable path of extravasated contrast material. Treatment is with an indwelling catheter (IDC/Foley). B. Intraperitoneal bladder ruptureo Occurs in approximately ~15% (range 10-20%) of major bladder injuries, and typically is the result of a direct blow to the already distended bladder. Cystography demonstrates intraperitoneal contrast material around bowel loops, between mesenteric folds and in the paracolic gutters. Treatment is surgical repair. C. Combined bladder ruptureo Simultaneous intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal injury. Cystography usually demonstrates extravasation patterns that are typical for both types of injury.",
