The drugs which are used are - Cisplatin Methotrexate 5 Fu Paclitaxel Docetaxel Sometimes combinations of these drugs are used. a) Treatment of localized head and neck cancers - These tumors are treated with curative intent either with surgery or radiotherapy. The choice of modality differs according to anatomic location and institutional expeise. In early laryngeal cancer generally, radiotherapy is done to preserve voice while in early oral cavity cancers, surgery is preferred to avoid the long-term complication of radiation such as xerostomia and dental decay. b) Locally or advanced regional disease - Combined modality therapy including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy is used. Concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy appear to be most effective. c) Recurrent or metastatic disease - chemotherapy is used. Management of neck lymph nodes The neck lymph nodes should be treated when there are clinically positive nodes or the risk for occult disease is high based on the location and stage of the primary lesion. The decision to perform neck dissection or irradiate the neck is related to the treatment of the primary lesion. If the primary tumor is being treated with radiation and the neck is N0 or N1, the nodes are usually treated with irradiation. For surgically treated primary lesions, N0 or N1 neck disease may be treated surgically as well (Radical neck dissection/Modified neck dissection/Selective neck dissection). Negative prognostic factors such as extracapsular spread of tumor, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, fixation to surrounding structures, and multiple positive nodes are indicators for postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy. For N2 or N3 neck disease, neck dissection with planned postoperative radiation therapy is performed.",

Also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum. The tumor arises only in the parotid gland. Almost always arises in the lower poion of the parotid gland overlying the angle of mandible. Common in males. (Occurs most often in older white men) Age: 5th to 7th decade. Association is seen with smoking. Bilaterality is seen in 10% cases. Its well encapsulated, extremely slow growing tumor, never turns malignant. A peculiar feature of Wahins tumor is that it shows 'hot' spot in 99' Tc-peechnate scan. Other tumors of the parotid show 'cold' spot (Oncocytomas another benign parotid tumor also shows hot spot). (Because of the high mitochondrial content within oncocytes, the oncocyte-rich Wahin tumor and Oncocytomas incorporate technetium Tc 99m and appear as hot spots on radionuclide scans.) Also remember Godwin's tumor - Benign lymphoepithelial tumor of the parotid gland. Most salivary gland tumors are benign. However remember that the smaller the salivary gland, the higher is the chance of the tumor being malignant.

It is a fluctuant swelling that may transilluminate and is often soft in its early stages so that it may be difficult to palpate. If the cyst becomes infected it becomes erythematous and tender and, on occasions, it may be difficult to differentiate from a tuberculous abscess. Ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration both aid diagnosis and treatment is by complete excision, which is best undeaken when the lesion is quiescent.

Radiographically, the tumour area appears as a rounded and well-defined lucency in the bone with varying size and features. Numerous cyst-like radiolucent areas can be seen in larger tumours (multi-locular) giving a characteristic \"soap bubble\" appearance. A single radiolucent area can be seen in smaller tumours (unilocular). The radiodensity of an ameloblastoma is about 30 Hounsfield units, which is about the same as keratocystic odontogenic tumours. However, ameloblastomas show more bone expansion and seldom show high density areas. Lingual plate expansion is helpful in diagnosing ameloblastoma as cysts rarely do this.

The submandibular space is divided into 2 compaments by the mylohyoid muscle. a. Sublingual compament (above the mylohyoid). b. Submaxillary and submental (below the mylohyoid) The two compaments are continuous around the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle. Aetiology - Dental infections are the most common cause. The infection is most often caused by a virulent Streptococcus (Group A streptococcus are most common) along with anaerobes. Clinical Features Odynophagia (painful swallowing). Trismus (difficulty in the opening mouth). When infection is localized to sublingual space, structures in the floor of the month are swollen and tongue seems to be pushed up and back When the infection spreads to submaxillary space, the submental and submandibular regions become swollen and tender with woody hard feeling. Complications Airway obstruction due to laryngeal oedema, or swelling and push back of the tongue. Spread of infection to parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal spaces and thence to the mediastinum. Aspiration pneumonia. Septicemia. Treatment Consists of giving high doses of broad-spectrum antibiotics, combined with metronidazole to combat the anaerobes immediately until the results of cultures and sensitivity tests are available.

It is caused by injury to auriculotemporal nerve, after surgical trauma to the parotid gland. Frey syndrome is thought to be due to aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibers between the otic ganglion and salivary tissue, which leads to innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels. Frey syndrome is repoed by approximately 10 percent of patients, although rigorous testing may detect gustatory sweating in as many as 95 percent of patients after parotidectomy. Frey syndrome may occur from two weeks to two years after surgery due to a latency in the regeneration of parasympathetic nerve fibers; the area of involved skin may increase over time. The incidence of Frey syndrome is reduced by minimizing the parotid wound bed, placing fascial grafts between the skin and the gland bed, reconstructive techniques such as thick skin flaps, and postoperative.

The incidence increases in Oriental groups (1: 500) and decreases in the black population (1: 2000). The highest incidence repoed for cleft lip and palate occurs in the Indian tribes of Montana, USA (1: 276). Although cleft lip and palate is an extremely diverse and variable congenital abnormality, several distinct sub-groups exist, namely cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P), cleft palate (CP) alone and submucous cleft palate (SMCP). The typical distribution of cleft types is: *cleft lip alone: 15%; *cleft lip and palate: 45%; *isolated cleft palate: 40%. Cleft lip/palate predominates in males whereas cleft palate alone appears to be more common in females. In unilateral cleft lip the deformity affects the left side in 60% of cases. AETIOLOGY Contemporary opinion on the aetiology of cleft lip and palate is that cleft lip and palate and isolated cleft palate have a genetic predisposition and a contributory environmental component. A family history of cleft lip and palate in which the first-degree *The key features of the perioperative care of the child with cleft lip and palate *The associated complications of cleft lip and palate and their management relative is affected increases the risk to 1: 25 live bihs. Genetic influence is more significant in cleft lip/palate than cleft palate alone, in which environmental factors exe a greater influence. Environmental factors implicated in clefting include maternal epilepsy and drugs, e. g. steroids, diazepam and phenytoin. The role of antenatal folic acid supplements in preventing cleft lip and palate remains equivocal. Although most clefts of the lip and palate occur as an isolated deformity, Pierre Robin sequence remains the most common syndrome. This syndrome comprises isolated cleft palate, retrognathia and a posteriorly displaced tongue (glossoptosis), which is associated with early respiratory and feeding difficulties. Isolated cleft palate is more commonly associated with a syndrome than cleft lip/palate and cleft lip alone. Over 150 syndromes are associated with cleft lip and palate, although Stickler's (ophthalmic and musculoskeletal abnormalities), Shprintzen's (cardiac anomalies), Down's, Ape's and Treacher.

Investigation may include plain cervical radiograph, nerve conduction studies and brachial plexus MRI. Treatment is by surgical decompression, dividing the fibrous band or removing the cervical rib. The lower trunk of the plexus (mainly T1) is compressed, leading to wasting of the interossei and altered sensation in the T1 distribution. Compression of the subclan aery may result in a post-stenotic dilatation with thrombus and embolus formation.

Swelling usually occurs in the neck and may involve the parotid, submandibular, tongue and floor of mouth areas. The swelling may be bilateral and is soft and paially compressible, visibly increasing in size when the child coughs or cries. The characteristic that distinguishes it from all other neck swellings is that it is brilliantly translucent. The cheek, axilla, groin and mediastinum are other less frequent sites for a cystic hygroma. The behaviour of cystic hygromas during infancy is unpredictable. Sometimes the cyst expands rapidly and occasionally respiratory difficulty ensues, requiring immediate aspiration andeven occasionally a tracheostomy. The cyst may become infected. Definitive treatment is complete excision of the cyst at an early stage. Injection of a sclerosing agent, for example picibanil (OK-432), may reduce the size of the cyst; however, they are commonly multicystic and if the injection is extracystic subsequent surgery may be more difficult Bailey & Love, 25th, 729.",

It is these combined cervical and intraoral signs that constitute the characteristic feature of the lesion, as well as the accompanying putrid halitosis. The infection is often caused by a virulent streptococcal infection associated with anaerobic organisms and sometimes with other lesions of the floor of the mouth such as carcinoma. The infection encompasses both sides of the mylohyoid muscle causing oedema and inflammation such that the tongue may be displaced upwards and backwards, giving rise to dysphagia and subsequentlyto painful obstruction of the airway. Unless treated, cellulitis may extend beneath the deep fascial layers of the neck to involve the larynx, causing glottic oedema and airway compromise. Antibiotic therapy should be instituted as soon as possible using intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as amoxycillin or cefuroxime, combined with metronidazole to combat the anaerobes. In advanced cases when the swelling does not subside rapidly with such treatment, a curved submental incision may be used to drain both submandibular triangles. The mylohyoid muscle may be incised to decompress the floor of the mouth and corrugated drains placed in the wound, which is then lightly sutured. This operation may be conducted under local anaesthetic. Rarely, a tracheostomy may be necessary. Bailey & Love, 25th, 731",

These glands are predominately mucous secreting. The minor salivary glands contribute to the mucous blanket of the respiratory tract which traps and clears paiculate matter. In the oral cavity, the minor salivary glands produce most of the saliva not secreted at mealtime, which moistens and protects the mucous membranes; They facilitate taste deglutition and guard against cavities. Approximately 450 to 750 minor salivary glands are present intraorally, located in the mucosa of the lips and cheeks, hard and soft palate, uvula, floor of mouth, posterior tongue, retromolar trigone, and peritonsillar area. The largest concentration of intraoral salivary glands is on the hard palate. The parotid gland is the most common site for salivary gland tumors and majority of parotid gland tumors are benign (~90%).

The tympanomastoid fissure- The most used anatomical landmark is the tympanomastoid fissure. The tympanomastoid fissure lies between the mastoid and tympanic segments of the temporal bone. The facial nerve lies approximately 6-8 mm medial to suture. The Tragal pointer the nerve is usually located inferior and medial to the Tragal pointer of the external auditory canal, about 10mm. The Digastric muscle The facial nerve lies just superior and on the same plane as the plane of digastric muscle attachment. If the main trunk of facial nerve cannot be readily identified, retrograde dissection of a branch of facial nerve can be used. The buccal branch is best for this approach. In the infant and young child, these landmarks are not applicable because of differences in the rate of anatomic development of the parotid gland and mastoid.",
