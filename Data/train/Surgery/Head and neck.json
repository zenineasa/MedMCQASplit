        "question": "In carcinoma cheek what is the best drug for single drug chemotherapy",
        "exp": "Single-agent chemotherapy is used as palliative therapy in head and neck cancers with the recurrent or metastatic form of cancer. The drugs which are used are - Cisplatin Methotrexate 5 Fu Paclitaxel Docetaxel Sometimes combinations of these drugs are used. a) Treatment of localized head and neck cancers - These tumors are treated with curative intent either with surgery or radiotherapy. The choice of modality differs according to anatomic location and institutional expeise. In early laryngeal cancer generally, radiotherapy is done to preserve voice while in early oral cavity cancers, surgery is preferred to avoid the long-term complication of radiation such as xerostomia and dental decay. b) Locally or advanced regional disease - Combined modality therapy including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy is used. Concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy appear to be most effective. c) Recurrent or metastatic disease - chemotherapy is used. Management of neck lymph nodes The neck lymph nodes should be treated when there are clinically positive nodes or the risk for occult disease is high based on the location and stage of the primary lesion. The decision to perform neck dissection or irradiate the neck is related to the treatment of the primary lesion. If the primary tumor is being treated with radiation and the neck is N0 or N1, the nodes are usually treated with irradiation. For surgically treated primary lesions, N0 or N1 neck disease may be treated surgically as well (Radical neck dissection/Modified neck dissection/Selective neck dissection). Negative prognostic factors such as extracapsular spread of tumor, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, fixation to surrounding structures, and multiple positive nodes are indicators for postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy. For N2 or N3 neck disease, neck dissection with planned postoperative radiation therapy is performed.",

It consists of both epithelial and lymphoid elements thus known as adenolymphoma (probably arises from remnants of parotid tissue trapped in lymphnodes within the parotid gland). Also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum. The tumor arises only in the parotid gland. Almost always arises in the lower poion of the parotid gland overlying the angle of mandible. Common in males. (Occurs most often in older white men) Age: 5th to 7th decade. Association is seen with smoking. Bilaterality is seen in 10% cases. Its well encapsulated, extremely slow growing tumor, never turns malignant. A peculiar feature of Wahins tumor is that it shows 'hot' spot in 99' Tc-peechnate scan. Other tumors of the parotid show 'cold' spot (Oncocytomas another benign parotid tumor also shows hot spot). (Because of the high mitochondrial content within oncocytes, the oncocyte-rich Wahin tumor and Oncocytomas incorporate technetium Tc 99m and appear as hot spots on radionuclide scans.) Also remember Godwin's tumor - Benign lymphoepithelial tumor of the parotid gland. Most salivary gland tumors are benign. However remember that the smaller the salivary gland, the higher is the chance of the tumor being malignant.

It is a fluctuant swelling that may transilluminate and is often soft in its early stages so that it may be difficult to palpate. If the cyst becomes infected it becomes erythematous and tender and, on occasions, it may be difficult to differentiate from a tuberculous abscess. Ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration both aid diagnosis and treatment is by complete excision, which is best undeaken when the lesion is quiescent.

It is caused by injury to auriculotemporal nerve, after surgical trauma to the parotid gland. Frey syndrome is thought to be due to aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibers between the otic ganglion and salivary tissue, which leads to innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels. Frey syndrome is repoed by approximately 10 percent of patients, although rigorous testing may detect gustatory sweating in as many as 95 percent of patients after parotidectomy. Frey syndrome may occur from two weeks to two years after surgery due to a latency in the regeneration of parasympathetic nerve fibers; the area of involved skin may increase over time. The incidence of Frey syndrome is reduced by minimizing the parotid wound bed, placing fascial grafts between the skin and the gland bed, reconstructive techniques such as thick skin flaps, and postoperative.

The swelling may be bilateral and is soft and paially compressible, visibly increasing in size when the child coughs or cries. The characteristic that distinguishes it from all other neck swellings is that it is brilliantly translucent. The cheek, axilla, groin and mediastinum are other less frequent sites for a cystic hygroma. The behaviour of cystic hygromas during infancy is unpredictable. Sometimes the cyst expands rapidly and occasionally respiratory difficulty ensues, requiring immediate aspiration andeven occasionally a tracheostomy. The cyst may become infected. Definitive treatment is complete excision of the cyst at an early stage. Injection of a sclerosing agent, for example picibanil (OK-432), may reduce the size of the cyst; however, they are commonly multicystic and if the injection is extracystic subsequent surgery may be more difficult Bailey & Love, 25th, 729.",

Modified radical neck dissection is modification of RND that preserves nonlymphatic structures i. e. CN XI, SCM and IJV. MRND has been found to be equally effective in controlling neck disease as RND with superior functional outcome. Selective neck dissection Preservation of any of the levels I through V during neck dissection is known as Selective neck dissection.

The tympanomastoid fissure- The most used anatomical landmark is the tympanomastoid fissure. The tympanomastoid fissure lies between the mastoid and tympanic segments of the temporal bone.

If the main trunk of facial nerve cannot be readily identified, retrograde dissection of a branch of facial nerve can be used. The buccal branch is best for this approach.

This is termed Conley's pointer (tragal pointer) and indicates the position of the facial nerve, which lies 1 cm deep and inferior to its tip; The upper border of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Identification of this muscle not only helps to mobilise the parotid gland, but also exposes an area immediately superior, in which the facial nerve is usually located; The squamotympanic fissure; The styloid process (the nerve is superficial to it); The mastoid process can be drilled and the nerve identified more proximally. Retrograde techniques rely on the identification of one of the nerve main branches (buccal in relation to the parotid duct, marginal mandibular in relation to the facial vessels, temporal branch), which is then traced proximally until the main trunk is identified.

When performing surgical excision of the primary tumour, a 1 cm margin in all planes should be attempted in seeking a complete excision with pathologically clear (>5mm) margins. Resection resulting in paial or hemiglossectomy can be performed with either a cutting diathermy or laser if available. Advanced tumours (T3 and T4) often encroach upon the floor of the mouth and, occasionally, the mandible. In these circumstances a resection of the tongue and floor of the mouth and mandible is required. T4 tumours of the oral tongue may cross the midline, for which (sub)total glossectomy is the only option to achieve adequate tumour clearance. Decisions regarding elective neck dissections on the contralateral side will be dictated by radiological and clinical findings, in paicular proximity of the tumour to the midline.
