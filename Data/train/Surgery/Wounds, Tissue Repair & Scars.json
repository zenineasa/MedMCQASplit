The main pathophysiology of diabetic foot involves a combination of neuropathy, infection and ischaemia. The goal of management should be control of blood glucose and health education directed at preventing foot trauma. Prolonged antibiotic therapy should be used in the event of osteomyelitis. Prompt surgical drainage of abscesses should be undertaken. In summary, the treatment of diabetic foot should involve: 1. Adequate control of blood glucose2. Prompt control of sepsis3. Vascular assessment4. Debridement including minor amputations. Major amputations should be undertaken for severe spreading uncontrollable limb infection threatening life, or the limb is severely ischaemic. Once one limb has been amputated, there is increased risk of amputation of the other limb, and the patient's survival rate is only 30%. Topical antibiotics are not of much benefit in the management of diabetic foot. Though both options, a and c are correct, option a (control of diabetes) seems to be the better answer.",

An electrocardiogram therefore provides a rapid means of differentiating between hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia also causes potassium wasting by the kidney.

Correct treatment for the affected patient includes administration of a source of calcium ions (which will immediately oppose the neuromuscular effect of potassium) and administration of sodium ions (which, by producing a mild alkalosis, will shift potassium into cells); each will temporarily reduce serum potassium concentration. Infusion of glucose and insulin would also effect a temporary transcellular shift of potassium. However, these maneuvers are only temporarily effective; definitive treatment calls for removal of potassium from the body. The sodium- potassium exchange resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) would accomplish this removal, but over a period of hours and at the price of adding a sodium ion for each potassium ion that is removed. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is probably required for this patient, since these procedures also rectify the other consequences of acute renal failure, but they would not be the first line of therapy given the acute need to reduce the potassium level.

        "question": "Maximum tissue reaction in associated with which suture material?",
        "exp": "Ans. D. Plain catgut. (Ref. Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 36. Table 18. 1). While plain Catgut or Chromic catgut often causes bacterial infection due to inflammatory tissue reaction. Reaction to catgut depends on the stage of absorption and is mainly histocytic in type. Nonabsorbable sutures are encapsulated by a rim of connective tissue, while near the suture histocytes, giant cells and lymphocytes are found. This is most marked with silk and cotton, less so with Dacron, and least with nylon and wire.# All the natural sutures, silk, cotton, linen and catgut, are being replaced by polymeric synthetic materials that cause minimal inflammatory reactions, are of predictable strength and absorb at an appropriate rate. They can be manufactured as monofilaments or braids, and can be coated with wax, silicone or polybutyrate to allow them to run smoothly through tissues and to knot securely. The absorbables cause a minimal tissue reaction as they are resorbed. To aid in the prevention of postoperative infection, particularly after prosthetic surgery, absorbable synthetic sutures may be impregnated with an antiseptic (Vicryl Plus, a polyglactin, is impregnated with triclosan).# The integrity of some synthetic non-absorbables in holding healing tissues together can last indefinitely, such as the use of polypropylene in arterial anastomosis. Polyamide (nylon) is slowly biodegradable and therefore not suitable for this purpose. Many nonabsorbables are presented as monofilaments, which eliminates interstices in the thread and makes knots less likely to be a nidus for infection by reducing the risk of bacterial biofilms and adherence, but requires more skill in tying secure knots# Polyglyconate is newest synthetic monofilament absorbable suture. It is sterile, noncollagenous, nonantigenic, nonpyrogenic. It elicits only slight tissue reaction during absorption, absorption is by nonenzymatic hydrolytic process. Absorbable sutures. Suture. Tissue reaction. How supplied. Common indications. Contraindications. Catgut plain. High6/0-1 with needles; 4/0-3 without needles. Ligate superficial vessels, suture subcutaneous tissues. Stomas and other tissues that heal rapidly. Not for use in tissues which heal slowly and require prolonged support. Catgut chromic. Moderate6/0-3 with needles; 5/0-3 without needles. As for plain catgut Polyglactin. Mild8/D--2 with needles; 5/0-2 without needles. General surgical use where absorbable sutures required, e. g. gut anastomoses, vascular ligatures. Has become the 'workhorse' suture for many applications in most general surgical practices, including undyed for subcuticular wound closures. Ophthalmic surgery. Popular in some centres as an alternative to Vicryl and PDS. Not advised for use in tissues which require prolonged approximation under stress. Polyglyconate. Mild7/0-2 with needles Not advised for use in tissues which require prolonged approximation under stress. Polyglycolic acid. Minimal9/0-2 with needles; 9/0-2 without needles. Uses as for other absorbable sutures, in particular where slightly longer wound support is required. Not advised for use in tissues which require prolonged approximation under stress. Polydioxanone (PDS). Mild. Polydioxanone suture (PDS) 10/0-2 with needles. Uses as for other absorbable sutures, in particular where slightly longer wound support is required. Not for use in association with heart valves or synthetic grafts, or in situations in which prolonged tissue approximation under stress is required. Polyglycaprone. Mild8/0-2 with needles. Subcuticular in skin, ligation, gastrointestinal and muscle surgery. No use for extended supp. Non-absorbable sutures. Suture. Tissue reaction. Common uses. Contraindications. Silk. Moderate to high. Not recommended. Consider suitable absorbable or non-absorbable. Lgation and suturing when long-term tissue support is necessary for securing drains externally. Not for use with vascular prostheses or in tissues requiring prolonged approximation under stress Risk of infection and tissue reaction makes silk unsuitable for routine skin closure. Linen. Moderate. Ligation and suturing in gastrointestinal surgery. No longer in common use in most centres. Not advised for use with vascular prostheses. Surgical steel. Minimal. Closure of sternotomy wounds, Previously found favour for tendon and hernia repairs. Should not be used in conjunction with prosthesis of different metal. Nylon. Low. General surgical use, e. g. skin closure, abdominal wall mass closure, hernia repair, plastic surgery, neurosurgery, microsurgery, ophthalmic surgery. None. Polyester. Low. Cardiovascular, ophthalmic, plastic and general surgery. None. Polybutester. Low. Exhibits a degree of elasticity. Particularly favoured for use in plastic surgery. None. Polypropylene. Low. Cardiovascular surgery, plastic surgery, ophthalmic surgery, general surgical subcuticular skin closure. None",
