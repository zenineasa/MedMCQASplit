Hernias' Congenital hydrocele will resolve spontaneously within 1 year. Operation is required only when it persists for longer than 1 year\"In congenital hydrocele, the processus vaginalis is patent and connects with the peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents. Pressure on the hydrocele does not always empty it but the hydrocele fluid may drain into the peritoneal cavity when the child is lying down; thus, the hydrocele is often intermittent. Ascites should be considered if the swellings are bilateral. \"Congenital hydroceles are treated by herniotomy if they do not resolve spontaneously\"Treatment usually, no treatment of congenital hydrocele is indicated, because this condition typically resolves spontaneously by age 1. Most surgeons advocate observation in the majority of infants less than 12 months. Others may continue to be observed for longer, as the majority of patent processes vaginalis will close within the first 12-24 months of life",
