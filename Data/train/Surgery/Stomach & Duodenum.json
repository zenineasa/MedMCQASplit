Best diagnostic investigation for acute appendicitis in children is USG. \"Abdominal ultrasound detects a dilated (< 6 mm) tubular, aperistaltic structure which is not compressible and is surrounded by fluid. Ultrasound has a sensitivity of 85-90% and specificity of 95-100% for diagnosing appendicitis. Computed tomography may be done occasionally if the diagnosis is in doubt. \"--Ghai 8/e pg 287. Acute Appendicitis. Acute appendicitis is the MC general surgical emergency. QWorldwide, perforated appendicitis is the leading general surgical cause of deathQ. Pathophysiology: Obstruction of the lumenQ is believed to be the major cause of acute appendicitisQ. Obstruction of the lumen may be caused by inspissated stool (fecalithQ or appendicolithQ), lymphoid hyperplasiaQ, vegetable matter or seedsQ, parasites, ora neoplasmQ. Obstruction of the appendiceal lumen contributes to bacterial overgrowth and continued secretion of mucus leads to intraluminal distention and increased wall pressure. Luminal distention produces the visceral pain sensation experienced by the patient as periumbilical painQ. Subsequent impairment of lymphatic and venous drainage leads to mucosal ischemia. Bacteriology: MC bacteria isolated in perforated appendicitis: Bacteroides fragilisQ (80%) >E. coliQ (77%). Clinical Features: Diagnosis can be made primarily on the basis of the history and physical examination in most casesQ. Typical presentation: Periumbilical pain followed by anorexia and nausea. The pain then localizes to the right lower quadrant as the inflammatory process progresses to involve the parietal peritoneum overlying the appendix. This classic pattern of migratory pain is the most reliable symptom of acute appendicitisQ. A bout of vomiting may occur. Fever ensues, followed by the development of leukocytosis. Occasional patients have urinary symptoms or microscopic hematuria. Tenderness is directly over the appendix, at Mc. Burney's pointQ. Rectal and pelvic examinations are most likely to be negative (Tenderness on P/R examination in pelvic appendix)QDunphy's signQ* Pain on coughing. QRovsing's signQ* Pain in the right lower quadrant during palpation of the left lower quadrant. QObturator signQ* Pain on internal rotation of the hipQ* Suggestive of pelvic appendix. QIliopsoas signQ* Pain on extension of the right hipQ* Suggestive of retrocecal appendix. QDiagnosis: Laboratory Studies. WBC count is elevated, with more than 75% neutrophils in most patientsQ. Normal WBC count and differential is found in 10% of patients with acute appendicitisQ. High WBC count (>20, 00d/mL) suggests complicated appendicitis with gangrene or perforationQ. Microscopic hematuria is common in appendicitis (gross hematuria may indicate the presence of a kidney stone)QUltrasound: USG has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity >90% for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in patients of abdominal pain. Characteristic findings: Appendix >7 mm diameter, a thick-walled, non-compressible luminal structure seen in cross section (target lesion), or the presence of an appendicolithQ. Commonly used in children & pregnant patients0 with equivocal clinical findings suggestive of acute appendicitis. Plain X-ray: A calcified appendicolith is visible in only 10-15% of patients with acute appendicitis. Failure of the appendix to fill during a barium enema has been associated with appendicitisQ (this finding lacks sensitivity and specificity because up to 20% of normal appendices do not fill). CT Scan. CT scan: Sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 80-90% for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in patients with abdominal painQ. Classic findings on CT: Distended appendix >7 mm in diameter and circumferential wall thickening and enhancement (appearance of a halo or target)QCT detects appendicoliths in 50% of patients with appendicitis. Most valuable for older patients and in patients with atypical symptoms. Treatment: Most patients are managed by prompt appendectomyQ.",

        "exp": "Patients who have sustained a major thermal burn of 35% or more of their body surface area are at a predictably high risk for the development of gastric erosions and hemorrhage. Endoscopy has demonstrated that gastric erosions are present in 93% of these patients, whereas the occurrence of severe acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in severely burned patients ranges between 25% to 50%. At least 60% of patients at risk develop stress erosions within 1 to 2 days after the precipitating event. Painless upper gastrointestinal bleeding may be the only clinical sign. The onset of hemorrhage is often delayed, usually occurring 3 to 10 days after the onset of the primary disease. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is the diagnostic modality of choice to confirm the diagnosis and to differentiate stress erosion from other sources of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Correct identification of the bleeding source is made in greater than 90% of instances. If endoscopy is not diagnostic, visceral angiography through selective catheterization of the left gastric or splenic vessels may provide information regarding the primary vessel supplying the bleeding site. In contrast, barium examinations are usually of little value, due to the superficial nature of stress erosions, and in fact may be detrimental by interfering with the interpretation of subsequent aeriography.",

Upper GI bleeding refers to bleeding that arises from the GI tract proximal to the ligament of Treitz and accounts for nearly 80% of significant GI hemorrhage. The causes of upper GI bleeding are best categorized as either nonvariceal or bleeding related to portal hypertension. The nonvariceal causes account for about 80% of such bleeding, with peptic ulcer disease being the most. common. The foundation of diagnosis and management of patients with an upper GI bleed is an OGD scopy. Early OGD scopy (within 24 hours) results in reductions in blood transfusion requirements, a decrease in the need for surgery, and a shorter length of hospital stay. Endoscopic identification of the source of bleeding also permits an estimate of the risk for subsequent or persistent hemorrhage as well as facilitating operative planning.",

        "exp": "(C) Incisura angularis. GASTRIC ULCERS tend to be larger in comparison to Duodenal Ulcers. Fibrosis results rarely & shown as hourglass contraction of the stomach. Large chronic ulcers may erode posteriorly into the pancreas & erode major vessels such as the splenic artery. Less commonly erode into other organs such as the transverse colon. Chronic gastric ulcers are much more common on the lesser curve (especially at the incisura angularis). Chronic gastric ulcers are less common on the greater curve and, even when high on the lesser curve, they tend to be at the boundary between the acid-secreting and the non-acid-secreting epithelia. With atrophy of parietal cell mass, non-acid-secreting epithelium migrates up the lesser curvature. Major causative factor (60% of gastric & up to 50-75% of duodenal ulcers) is chronic inflammation due to Helicobacter pylori that colonizes the antral mucosa. Majority of Gastric ulcers can be attributed to either H. pylori infection or NSAID induced mucosal damage. Types of Gastric ulcer: Type I - located near the angularis incisura on the lesser curvature, close to the border between the antrum & the body of the stomach. These patients usually have normal or decreased acid secretion. Type II ulcer: Occurs in conjunction with active or healed duodenal ulcer disease. Type III: Prepyloric ulcer. Type IV ulcer: Gastro esophageal junction at the lesser curve. Type V ulcer: Anywhere in the stomach associated with chronic NSAID use or aspirin use.
