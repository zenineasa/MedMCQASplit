The gene frequency in the population is approximately 0.0006. It does, however, occur with greater frequency in certain populations such as Ashkenazi Jews, in whom there is often a common (founder) mutation. BRCA2 .is located on chromosome 13q and there is an association with male breast cancer. Women who are thought to be gene carri- ers may be offered breast screening (and ovarian screening in the case of BRCA1, which is known to impart a 50 % lifetime risk of ovarian cancer), usually as part of a research programme, or genetic counselling and mutation analysis.

Hereditary cancer occurs in multiple family members due to germline mutations in high-risk genes which are inherited in autosomal dominant pattern. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two major high-risk genes associated with hereditary breast cancer. Mutations in CHEK2 contribute to a substantial fraction of familial breast cancer. Carriers of TP53 mutations develop Li-Fraumeni syndrome and are at high risk of developing early onset breast cancer, but these mutations are very rare. Susceptibility alleles in other genes, such as PTEN, ATM, STK11/LKB1, and MSH2/MLH1 are also very rare causes of breast cancer. ~ Devita.",

Breast conservation is the preferred form of treatment because of cosmetic advantages. However there are certain contraindications for conservative surgery (described in subsequent question).* Management of axillary lymph nodes :# Earlier dissection of axillary lymph nodes (level I and II) was performed to assess the lymph node status (i.e. presence or absence of occult metastasis)# Now Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered the standard for evaluation of the axillary lymph nodes for metastasis in women who have clinically negative lymph nodes, (the sentinel lymph node is the first regional lymph node to receive tumor cells that metastasize along the lymphatic pathway from the primary breast cancer)# Axillary Lymph node dissection is performed for clinically palpable axillary lymphnodes or metastatic disease detected in sentinel lymph node biopsy.* Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to :# All node-positive cancers# Node negative cancers if > 1 cm in size# Node negative cancer > .5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as :* Blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion* High nuclear grade* High histological grade* HER 2/neu overexpression* Negative hormone receptor status* Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive tumors# HER-2/neu expression is determined for all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and may be used to provide prognostic information in patients with node-negative breast cancer and predict the relative efficacy of various chemotherapy regimens. Trastuzumab is the HER-2/neu-targeted agent that is added to the adjuvant therapy is the tumor shows overexpression of HER-2/neu receptors.Advanced Local-Regional Breast Cancer (Stage III)(Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + MRM + adjuvant radiation therapy +chemotherapy + antiestrogen therapy)* Here the disease is advanced on the chest wall or in regional lymph nodes (or both), with no evidence of metastasis to distant sites. Such patients are recognized to be at significant risk for the development of subsequent metastases, and treatment addresses the risk for both local and systemic relapse.* In an effort to provide optimal local-regional disease-free survival as well as distant disease-free survival for these women, surgery is integrated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.* Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (administration of therapeutic agents prior to the main treatment) should be considered in the initial management of all patients with locally advanced stage III breast cancer.* Surgical therapy for women with stage III disease is usually a modified radical mastectomy, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Antiestrogen therapy (tamoxifen) is added for hormone receptor positive tumors.* Chemotherapy is used to maximize distant disease-free survival, whereas radiation therapy is used to maximize local-regional disease-free survival.* In selected patients with stage III A cancer, neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy can reduce the size of the primary cancer and permit breastconserving surgery.Distant Metastases (Stage IV)(mainly palliative treatment)* Treatment for stage IV breast cancer is not curative but may prolong survival and enhance a woman's quality of life.* Hormonal therapies that are associated with minimal toxicity are preferred to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Appropriate candidates for initial hormonal therapy include women with hormone receptor-positive cancers; women with bone or soft tissue metastases only; and women with limited and asymptomatic visceral metastases.* Systemic chemotherapy is indicated for women with hormone receptor-negative cancers, symptomatic visceral metastases, and hormonerefractory metastases.* Bisphosphonates, which may be given in addition to chemotherapy or hormone therapy, should be considered in women with bone metastases.",

In recurrent cases, a characteristic fistula tract often tunnels under the smooth muscle of the nipple and opens onto the skin at the edge of the areola.* Many women have an inverted nipple, most likely as a secondary effect of the underlying inflammation.* More than 90% of the afflicted are smokers. It has been suggested that a relative deficiency of vitamin A associated with smoking or toxic substances in tobacco smoke alter the differentiation of the ductal epithelium.* The key feature is keratinizing squamous metaplasia of the nipple ducts. Keratin shed from these cells plugs the ductal system, causing dilation and eventually rupture of the duct. An intense chronic granulomatous inflammatory response develops once keratin spills into the surrounding periductal tissue.* With recurrences, a secondary anaerobic bacterial infection may supervene and cause acute inflammation.* Simple incision drains the abscess cavity, but the offending keratinizing epithelium remains and recurrences are common.* In most cases, en bloc surgical removal of the involved duct and contiguous fistula tract is curative.

HER2-positive tumors are a potential exception.* Detection of breast cancer cells either in the circulation or bone marrow is associated with an increased relapse rate.* Estrogen and progesterone receptor status are of prognostic significance. Tumors that lack either or both of these receptors are more likely to recur than tumors that have them.* Several measures of tumor growth rate correlate with early relapse. S-phase analysis using flow cytometry is the most accurate measure. Indirect S-phase assessments using antigens associated with the cell cycle, such as PCNA (Ki67), are also valuable.* Tumors with a high proportion (more than the median) of cells in S-phase pose a greater risk of relapse; chemotherapy offers the greatest survival benefit for these tumors.* Assessment of DNA content in the form of ploidy is of modest value, with nondiploid tumors having a somewhat worse prognosis.* Histologic classification of the tumor has also been used as a prognostic factor. Tumors with a poor nuclear grade have a higher risk of recurrence than tumors with a good nuclear grade.* Molecular changes in the tumor are also useful. Tumors that overexpress erbB2 (HER2/neu) or have a mutated p53 gene have a worse prognosis. Tumors that overexpress erbB2 are more likely to respond to higher doses of doxorubicincontaining regimens and predict those tumors that will respond to HER2/neu antibodies (trastuzumab) (herceptin) and HER2/ neu kinase inhibitors.* The presence of more microvessels in a tumor, particularly when localized in socalled hot spots, is associated with a worse prognosis.* Other variables that have also been used to evaluate prognosis include proteins associated with invasiveness, such as type IV collagenase, cathepsin D, plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator receptor, and the metastasissuppressor gene nm23. None of these has been widely accepted as a prognostic variable for therapeutic decision-making. One problem in interpreting these prognostic variables is that most of them have not been examined in a study using a large cohort of patients.",

Nipple-areolar disease alone usually represents in situ cancer; these patients have a 10-year survival rate of over 80%. In contrast, if Paget's disease presents with a mass, the mass is likely to be an infiltrating ductal carcinoma. The generally recommended surgical procedure for Paget's disease is currently a modified radical mastectomy. The validity of breast-saving surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy for patients without an associated mass is under investigation.",

This may discharge.* These fluids then set up an irritant reaction in surrounding tissue leading to periductal mastitis or even abscess and fistula formation.* In some cases, a chronic indurated mass forms beneath the areola, which mimics a carcinoma. Fibrosis eventually develops, which may cause slit-like nipple retraction.* A marked association between recurrent periductal inflammation and smoking has been demonstrated. It is certainly clear that cessation of smoking increases the chance of a long-term cure.Clinical features* Nipple discharge (of any colour), a subareolar mass, abscess, mammary duct fistula and/or nipple retraction are the most common symptom/s.Treatment* In the case of a mass or nipple retraction, a carcinoma must be excluded by obtaining a mammogram and negative cytology or histology. If any suspicion remains the mass should be excised.* Antibiotic therapy may be tried, the most appropriate agents being co-amoxiclav or flucloxacillin and metronidazole.* However, surgery is often the only option likely to bring about cure of this notoriously difficult condition; this consists of excision of all of the major ducts (Hadfield's operation).

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., <lcm size, nodes -ve , ER/ PR +ve, her 2/ neu -ve Prognostic factors of breast carcinoma* The most important prognostic variables are provided by tumor staging.* The size of the tumor and the status of the axillary lymph nodes provide reasonably accurate information on the likelihood of tumor relapse.* There is rarely justification for adjuvant chemotherapy in most women with tumors <1 cm in size whose axillary lymph nodes are negative. HER2-positive tumors are a potential exception.* Detection of breast cancer cells either in the circulation or bone marrow is associated with an increased relapse rate.* Estrogen and progesterone receptor status are of prognostic significance. Tumors that lack either or both of these receptors are more likely to recur than tumors that have them.* Several measures of tumor growth rate correlate with early relapse. S-phase analysis using flow cytometry is the most accurate measure. Indirect S-phase assessments using antigens associated with the cell cycle, such as PCNA (Ki67), are also valuable.* Tumors with a high proportion (more than the median) of cells in S-phase pose a greater risk of relapse; chemotherapy offers the greatest survival benefit for these tumors.* Assessment of DNA content in the form of ploidy is of modest value, with nondiploid tumors having a somewhat worse prognosis.* Histologic classification of the tumor has also been used as a prognostic factor. Tumors with a poor nuclear grade have a higher risk of recurrence than tumors with a good nuclear grade.* Molecular changes in the tumor are also useful. Tumors that overexpress erbB2 (HER2/neu) or have a mutated p53 gene have a worse prognosis. Tumors that overexpress erbB2 are more likely to respond to higher doses of doxorubicin- containing regimens and predict those tumors that will respond to HER2/neu antibodies (trastuzumab) (herceptin) and HER2/ neu kinase inhibitors.* The presence of more microvessels in a tumor, particularly when localized in so-called hot spots, is associated with a worse prognosis.* Other variables that have also been used to evaluate prognosis include proteins associated with invasiveness, such as type IV collagenase, cathepsin D, plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator receptor, and the metastasis- suppressor gene nm23. None of these has been widely accepted as a prognostic variable for therapeutic decision- making. One problem in interpreting these prognostic variables is that most of them have not been examined in a study using a large cohort of patients.",
