Repeat from Primary DNB CET December 2010\"The classical electrolyte abnormality associated with pyloric stenosis is hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, presumably due to ongoing gastric acid loss from vomiting. Paradoxical aciduria is sometimes noted (with progressive Hypokalemia and hypovolemia) because the kidney excretes protons in exchange of sodium in an attempt to conserve fluid\"Note: Paradoxical aciduria is seen only after body stores of Sodium & Potassium get depleted. Initially there is alkaliuria, not aciduria.",
