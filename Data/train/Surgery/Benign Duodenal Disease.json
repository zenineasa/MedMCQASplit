This consists of two adjacent, fluid-filled cavities in the upper abdomen: a lateral and usually somewhat larger cavity representing the dilated stomach, and a medial cavity representing the distended proximal duodenum between the pylorus and the stenosis.\"- Ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology By Eberhard Merz, F. Bahlmann 2/e p298Double bubble sign:The double bubble sign is a finding observed on radiographs of newborns and infants. It is reproducible with a variety of other imaging modalities, including upper gastrointestinal studies and prenatal sonography. The finding depicts two air-filled structures in the upper abdomen, with little or no air distally. Horizontal-beam radiographs will demonstrate air and fluid levels in both bubbles.The first bubble (proximal and left sided) is - stomachThe second bubble (to the right of the midline) is - duodenumThe detection of the double bubble sign leads to suspicion of a number of structural anomalies, all of which cause duodenal obstruction.Causes:Intrinsic causes areExtrinsic causes are- duodenal atresia,- annular pancreas,- duodenal stenosis,- malrotation of the gut with obstruction produced byandmidgut volvulus or by Ladd bands, and- duodenal webs;- preduodenal position of the portal vein.The specific duodenal structural anomaly causing the obstruction determines the appearance, prominence, and presence of air distal to the obstruction. Duodenal atresia produces complete obstruction, partially obstructing anomalies, such as duodenal web or duodenal stenosis, allow passage of some air distal to the obstruction and a less dramatic double bubble.",

        "question": "Anomaly associated with duodenal atresia is?",
        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Down syndromeREF: Sabiston 18th ed chapter 71Duodenal atresia (DA) is thought to occur as a result of failure of vacuolization of the duodenum from its solid cord stage. The range of anatomic variants includes duodenal stenosis, mucosal web writh intact muscular wTall (so-called windsock deformity); two ends separated by a fibrous cord, or complete separation writh a gap within the duodenum.Associated Anomalies: DA is associated with several conditions, including prematurity, Down syndrome, maternal polyhydramnios, malrotation, annular pancreas, and biliary atresia. Other anomalies, such as cardiac, renal, esophageal, and anorectal anomalies, are also common. In most cases, the duodenal obstruction is distal to the ampulla of Vater, and infants present writh bilious emesis in the neonatal period. In patients with a mucosal wreb, the symptoms of postprandial emesis may occur later in life.Diagnosis: The classic plain abdominal radiograph of DA is termed the double-bubble sign (air-filled stomach and duodenal bulb, In cases in which there is no distal air, the diagnosis is secured, and no further studies are necessary. On the other hand, if distal air is present, an upper gastrointestinal contrast study is performed fairly rapidly. This study is important not only to confirm the diagnosis of duodenal stenosis or atresia but also to exclude midgut volvulus, which wrould constitute a surgical emergency.Treatment: The management of DA is by surgical bypass of the duodenal obstruction as either a side-to-side or proximal transverse-to-distal longitudinal (diamond-shaped) duodenoduodenostomy.",
