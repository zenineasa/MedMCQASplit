QCushing's ulcers are more prone to perforate than other stress ulcers. Stress gastritis lesions may be detected within hours after injury and are considered early if they appear within the first 24 hours. Early lesions are typically multiple and shallow, with discrete areas of erythema along with focal hemorrhage or an adherent dot. Pathophysiology: Multi factorial etiology. Impaired mucosal defense mechanisms against luminal acid such as a reduction in blood flow, mucus, and bicarbonate secretion by mucosal cells, or a reduction in endogenous prostaglandinsQ. Stress is considered present when occurs. In stress (hypoxia, sepsis, or organ failure), mucosal ischemia is the main factor responsible for the breakdown of these normal defense mechanismsQ. Risk factors or Predisposing clinical conditions* ARDSQ* Multiple traumaQ* Major burn >35% of BSAQ* Oliguric renal failureQ* Large transfusionQ requirements* Hepatic dysfunctionQ* HypotensionQ* Prolonged surgical proceduresQ* Sepsis. QClinical Features: More than 50% of patients develop their stress gastritis within 1-2 days after a traumatic event. The only clinical sign may be painless upper Gl bleeding that may be delayed at onset. The bleeding is usually slow and intermittent. QDiagnosis: Endoscopy is required to confirm the diagnosisQ and to differentiate stress gastritis from other sources of GI hemorrhage. Treatment: Definitive fluid resuscitation with correction of any coagulation abnormalities and treatment of the underlying sepsis. QMore than 80% of patients stop bleeding using this approachQ. Intraluminal gastric pH should be maintained >5. 0 with antisecretory agents. Bleeding that recurs or persists requiring >6 units of blood (3(X)0 mL) is an indication for operation. QBecause most of the lesions are in the proximal stomach or fundus, a long anterior gastrotomy should be made in this area. All bleeding areas are oversewn with figure-of-eight stitches taken deep within the gastric wall. Most of the superficial erosions are not actively bleeding and therefore do not require ligature unless a blood vessel is seen at its baseQ. The operation is completed by closing the anterior gastrotomy and performing a truncal vagotomy and pyloroplastyQ to reduce acid secretion. Prophylaxis: Complete neutralization of luminal acid or antisecretory therapy precludes the development of experimental stress gastritisQ. Sepsis control, ventilatory support, adequate nutrition and correction of dyselectrolytemia. QDrugs used are: Antacids, H2-receptor antagonists and sucralfate",

This consists of two adjacent, fluid-filled cavities in the upper abdomen: a lateral and usually somewhat larger cavity representing the dilated stomach, and a medial cavity representing the distended proximal duodenum between the pylorus and the stenosis. \"- Ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology By Eberhard Merz, F. Bahlmann 2/e p298. Double bubble sign: The double bubble sign is a finding observed on radiographs of newborns and infants. It is reproducible with a variety of other imaging modalities, including upper gastrointestinal studies and prenatal sonography. The finding depicts two air-filled structures in the upper abdomen, with little or no air distally. Horizontal-beam radiographs will demonstrate air and fluid levels in both bubbles. The first bubble (proximal and left sided) is - stomach. The second bubble (to the right of the midline) is - duodenum. The detection of the double bubble sign leads to suspicion of a number of structural anomalies, all of which cause duodenal obstruction. Causes: Intrinsic causes are. Extrinsic causes are- duodenal atresia, - annular pancreas, - duodenal stenosis, - malrotation of the gut with obstruction produced byandmidgut volvulus or by Ladd bands, and- duodenal webs;- preduodenal position of the portal vein. The specific duodenal structural anomaly causing the obstruction determines the appearance, prominence, and presence of air distal to the obstruction. Duodenal atresia produces complete obstruction, partially obstructing anomalies, such as duodenal web or duodenal stenosis, allow passage of some air distal to the obstruction and a less dramatic double bubble.",

        "question": "Anomaly associated with duodenal atresia is?",
        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Down syndrome. REF: Sabiston 18th ed chapter 71. Duodenal atresia (DA) is thought to occur as a result of failure of vacuolization of the duodenum from its solid cord stage. The range of anatomic variants includes duodenal stenosis, mucosal web writh intact muscular w. Tall (so-called windsock deformity); two ends separated by a fibrous cord, or complete separation writh a gap within the duodenum. Associated Anomalies: DA is associated with several conditions, including prematurity, Down syndrome, maternal polyhydramnios, malrotation, annular pancreas, and biliary atresia. Other anomalies, such as cardiac, renal, esophageal, and anorectal anomalies, are also common. In most cases, the duodenal obstruction is distal to the ampulla of Vater, and infants present writh bilious emesis in the neonatal period. In patients with a mucosal wreb, the symptoms of postprandial emesis may occur later in life. Diagnosis: The classic plain abdominal radiograph of DA is termed the double-bubble sign (air-filled stomach and duodenal bulb, In cases in which there is no distal air, the diagnosis is secured, and no further studies are necessary. On the other hand, if distal air is present, an upper gastrointestinal contrast study is performed fairly rapidly. This study is important not only to confirm the diagnosis of duodenal stenosis or atresia but also to exclude midgut volvulus, which wrould constitute a surgical emergency. Treatment: The management of DA is by surgical bypass of the duodenal obstruction as either a side-to-side or proximal transverse-to-distal longitudinal (diamond-shaped) duodenoduodenostomy.",
