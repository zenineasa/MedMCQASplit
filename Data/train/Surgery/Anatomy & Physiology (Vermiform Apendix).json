        "exp": "ANSWER: (C) Retrocaecal. REF: Sabiston s 18th ed chapter 49. The tip of the appendix may lie in a variety of locations. The most common location is retrocecal but within the peritoneal cavity. It is pelvic in 30% and retroperitoneal in 7% of the population. The varying location of the tip of the appendix likely explains the myriad of symptoms that are attributable to the inflamed appendix. The length of the appendix varies from 2 to 20 cm, and the average length is 9 cm in adults. The base of the appendix is located at the convergence of the taeniae along the inferior aspect of the cecum, and this anatomic relationship facilitates identification of the appendix at operation.",
