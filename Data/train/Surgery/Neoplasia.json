Superficial: 9-11%;- Cystic: 4-8%; Pigmented: 6%; Morpheic: 2%.# Treatment:- Surgical excision -- the treatment of choice with cure rates between 85 and 95%.- Electrodessication and curettage -- commonly used for small superficial lesions (2--5 mm in diameter) gives cure rates between 85 and 100%.- Radiotherapy -- BCC is very radiosensitive and has an overall response of 92 % in selected patients. This is reserved for elderly patients who are not suitable for surgery or for specialised anatomical sites.- Moh's micrographic surgery (chemosurgery) --involving serial horizontal excision and mapping of the tumour.

A part of the lung, heart and the shoulder are shielded from the radiation beam to reduce the side effects. The term 'mantel' is derived from the name of a garment much like a cloak.

HYPERNEPHROMA (Syn.

MRV remains the best choice for detecting renal vein invasion.# Treatment- If the tumor is confined to the kidney, treatment is nephrectomy with removal of the perinephric fat.- Nephrectomy can be performed through a loin or a transverse or oblique upper abdominal incision. The transab- dominal approach has the advantage that the renal pedicle and the IVC can be widely exposed.- The vascular pedicle should be ligated before the kidney is mobilised because handling the tumor may cause malignant cells to be released into the circulation.- Adenocarcinoma of the kidney does not respond well to radiotherapy or conventional chemotherapy. There have been early promising results from clinical trials of the cytokine interleukin-2 in this condition.- Conventional surgical treatment is by nephroureterectomy.- Percutaneous resection of these cancers is controversial. Also know: WILMS' TUMOR (Syn. NEPHROBLASTOMA)# This is a mixed tumor containing epithelial and connective tissue elements arising from embryonic nephrogenic tissue.# The tumors are usually discovered during the first 4 years of life.# Abdominal tumor. An abdominal tumor appears which grows rapidly while the general well being of the child deteriorates.# Pyrexia, which is a feature in half of these patients, disappears when the tumor is removed.# Initial Imaging is by ultrasonography, however CECT is best for evaluation.# Metastasis occurs early, mainly to the lungs. Liver and bone metastases are rare; and brain metastases even more so.# Lymphatic spread is uncommon.# The presence of bone secondaries favours a diagnosis of nephroblastoma, another renal tumor of childhood.# Rx: Nephrectomy should be performed as soon as possible and followed by radiotherapy with or without chemo- therapy.- Partial nephrectomy may be possible in patients with bilateral disease.# Prognosis- Under 1 year of age 80 per cent survive for 5 years, but the prognosis is less good in older children.- Recurrences usually occur within a year, so a child surviving for 18 months or more is probably cured.- NATIONAL WILMS' TUMOR STUDY GROUP (NWTS) STAGING SYSTEM (post-chemotheraphy based staging system in Wilms tumor).

Most are present from birth and initially increase in size, but many eventually regress spontaneously. While hemangiomas typically are localized lesions confined to the head and neck, they can occasionally be more extensive (angiomatosis) and can occur internally. Nearly one third of these internal lesions are found in the liver. Malignant transformation is rare. Capillary hemangiomas. Most common type. Occur in the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and mucous membranes of the oral cavities and lips, as well as in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Juvenile hemangiomas (strawberry type hemangiomas). Juvenile hemangiomas of the newborn are extremely common and can be multiple. These arise in the skin and grow rapidly for a few months, but then fade by 1 to 3 years of age and completely regress by age 7 in the vast majority of cases. Cavernous hemangiomas. Composed of large, dilated vascular channels. As compared to capillary hemangiomas, cavernous hemangiomas are more infiltrative, frequently involve deep structures, and do not spontaneously regress. Intravascular thrombosis and associated dystrophic calcification are common. They can be locally destructive, and as a result some may require surgery. Cavernous hemangiomas are one component of von Hippel-Lindau disease. Pyogenic granulomas. Capillary hemangiomas that present as rapidly growing red pedunculated lesions on the skin, gingival, or oral mucosa. They bleed easily and are often ulcerated. Roughly a quarter of lesions develop after trauma, reaching a size of 1 to 2 cm within a few weeks. Curettage and cautery is usually curative. Pregnancy tumor (granuloma gravidarum) is a pyogenic granuloma that occurs infrequently (1% of patients) in the gingiva of pregnant women. These lesions may spontaneously regress (especially after pregnancy), or undergo fibrosis, but occasionally require surgical excision",
