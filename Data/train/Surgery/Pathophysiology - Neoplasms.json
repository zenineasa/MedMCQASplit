Gold standard test for the diagnosis of insulinoma is the 72-hour fasting test. \"Gold standard test for the diagnosis of insulinoma is the 72-hour fastinge test. An insulin-to-glucose ratio >0. 4 is consistent with insulinoma. Insulinoma* Insulinoma is MC functioning tumor of the endocrine pancreas* The average age at diagnosis is 45 years. Location of Insulinoma* 97% in pancreas (equal distribution in the head, body, and tail)0* 3% in duodenum, splenic hilum, or gastrocolic ligament0.* Typically small, with an average size of 1. 0 to 1. 5 cm. Diagnostic hallmark is Whipple's triad: Symptoms of hypoglycemia + Low blood glucose levels (40-50 mg/dL) +Relief of symptoms after the administration of glucose. Clinical Features: Diagnostic hallmark is Whipple's triad0: Fasting-induced neuroglyopenic symptoms of hypoglycemia (diaphoresis, shaking, mental confusion, obtundation, and seizures), low blood glucose levels (40 to 50 mg/dL), and relief of symptoms after the administration of glucose. Sympathetic overactivity0 in response to hypoglycemia: Fatigue, weakness, fearfulness, hunger, tremor, diaphoresis, and tachycardia. CNS disturbance: Apathy, irritability, anxiety, confusion, excitement, loss of orientation, blurred vision, delirium, stupor, coma, and'or seizures. Significant weight gain: Patients eat frequently to prevent hypoglycemia.* it's a painless condition. Diagnosis:* Gold standard test for the diagnosis of insulinoma is the 72-hour fasting0 test.* An insulin-to-glucose ratio >0. 4 is consistent w ith insulinoma0.* Provocative testing with tolbutamide, glucagon: or intravenous calcium is rarely required. CECT or MR1: Hyperattenuating as compared w ith surrounding pancreatic tissue because of rich vascular supply. Localization:* Angiography will detect approximately 70% of insulinomas >5 mm, showing a characteristic vascular blush0. Portal venous sampling for insulin with or without arterial stimulation with calcium is the best pre-operative method of localization0.* ELS with intra-operative palpation is best localization technique for Insulinoma0. Treatment:* Diazoxide decreases beta cell release of insulin, used to prevent or attenuate symptoms of hypoglycemia prior to surgical interv ention once the diagnosis is made0.* Insulinomas are well suited for laparoscopic resection or enucleations0. Insulinoma of head of pancreas* Enucleation is TOCdeg. Insulinoma of body or tail of pancreas* Distal pancreatectomy is TOCdeg",
