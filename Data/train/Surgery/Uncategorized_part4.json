C: Osteosarcoma In radiographic terms, 'sunray' or 'sunburst', or 'spicule', are used for periosteal new bone formation in which new bone is formed perpendicular to the coex resulting in multiple lines like sunrays. This event could occur when the periosteum is rapidly stripped from the coex. It is believed that a variety of substances that contact the inner surface of the exposed periosteum can cause new bone formation. These substances include inflammatory products from infection, blood from trauma, granulomatous reactions or neoplasms.

IMA \"Occlusion of the inferior mesenteric aery does not always result in irreversible ischaemia of the descending and sigmoid colon, because the marginal aery of the colon usually receives an adequate supply from the left branch of the middle colic aery. Moreover, the sigmoid aeries may be supplied by the superior rectal aery, which anastomoses with the middle and inferior rectal aeries. When ischaemia does occur, it is usually maximal in the proximal descending colon because this region is fuhest from the collateral aerial supplies. \"- Gray's Anatomy The colon is supplied by SMA and IMA which have extensive collateral circulation in the form of marginal aery and arc of Riolan The Marginal Aery of Drummond connects SMA and IMA, and forms a continuous arcade along the mesenteric border of the colon. The Arc of Riolan, also known as the Meandering Mesenteric aery, is another vascular arcade present in the colonic mesentery that connect the proximal Middle Colic aery (branch of SMA) with the proximal Left colic aery (branch of IMA). These collateral circulation in the form of Marginal aery and Arc of Riolan are able to sustain the pa of left colon in case of occlusion of the IMA. Moreever a distal collateral circulation also exists between the superior rectal aery (a branch of IMA) and the middle and inferior rectal aery (branches of the internal iliac aery). Celiac trunk and SMA do not have such rich collateral circulation and supply much more impoant pas than colon. Renal aery is an end aery, does not have any collaterals, so any injury or complete occlusion would lead to loss of the kidney.",

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common true arterial aneurysm. An aortic aneurysm is defined as a focal dilation of the aorta with a diameter of at least 1. 5 times that of the expected normal diameter of that given aortic segment; in the AA, enlargement of the aortic diameter of more than 3 cm is usually considered aneurysmal. A most common site is infrarenal. More common in males than females. Incidence increases with age. At least 90% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms >4. 0 cm are related to atherosclerotic disease. Prognosis is related to both the size of an aneurysm and the severity of coexisting coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease. The risk of rupture is directly related to the size of an aneurysm. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually asymptomatic. They are usually detected incidentally on routine clinical examinations or investigation performed for some other reasons. As abdominal aortic aneurysms expand, however, they may become painful. Aneurysmal pain is usually a harbinger of rupture and represents a medical emergency. More often, acute rupture occurs without any prior warning, and this complication is always life-threatening. Contrast-enhanced CT is an investigation of choice. MRI is as sensitive and specific as CECT and is used if the use of contrast is precluded. Ultrasound is the screening study of choice and is useful for serial documentation of aneurysm size Operative repair of an aneurysm with the insertion of a prosthetic graft or endovascular placement of an aortic stent graft is indicated for: abdominal aortic aneurysms of any size that are expanding rapidly or are associated with symptoms. for asymptomatic aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is indicated if the diameter is >5. 5 cm. The decision to perform an open surgical operation or endovascular repair is based in part on the vascular anatomy and comorbid conditions. Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms has a lower short-term morbidity rate but a comparable long-term mortality rate with open surgical reconstruction. (Harrison 18/e) In Elective surgery of abdominal aortic aneurysm the operative mortality, rate approximates 1 to 2% whereas after acute rupture the mortality rate of emergency operation generally exceeds 50%.",

        "exp": "Ans is 'b' i. e. Contrast enema - Failure to Pass Meconium: Diagnosing Neonatal Intestinal Obstruction by VERA LOENING-BAUCKE, M. D., and KEN KIMURA, M. D. Timely passage of the first stool is a hallmark of the well-being of the newborn infant. 99% of term infants and 95% of premature infants pass meconium within 48 hrs of bih - Nelson 17/e p527. Failure of a full-term newborn to pass meconium within the first 24 hours should raise a suspicion of intestinal obstruction. It's usually a lower GI obstruction. In many cases of suspected neonatal intestinal obstruction, the clinical history and physical examination combined with plain abdominal radiographs, contrast enema radiographic examination, anorectal manometry and rectal biopsy eventually yield the diagnosis. Anal inspection is essential to exclude the presence of anal atresia, perinea] fistula with anal atresia and anal stenosis. In Hirschprung's disease barium enema radiographic examination, performed with the colon unprepared, may reveal a transition zone that separates the small- to normal-diameter aganglionic bowel from the dilated bowel above Meconium plug syndrome is the mildest and most common form of functional distal obstruction in the newborn. It is a transient form of distal colonic or rectal obstruction caused by inspissated, immobile meconium. Contrast enema is diagnostic, showing the outline of the meconium plug. In meconium ileus, low or distal intestinal obstruction results from the impaction of thick, tenacious meconium in the distal small bowel. Cystic fibrosis is the underlying disorder in most infants with meconium ileus. Contrast enema radiographic examination demonstrates a microcolon, often with no bowel contents. Reflux of contrast into the small bowel reveals the plugs. The small bowel is of narrow caliber below the plug and dilated above the plug. Small left colon syndrome is a condition with a characteristic caliber reduction in the sigmoid and descending colon unrelated to meconium inspissation or aganglionosis. Contrast studies show the colon to be shoened and to lack the usual touosity from the anus to the splenic flexure. A sharp transition zone is seen at the splenic flexure Other conditions associated with delayed passage of meconium are: Various maternal medical conditions can cause a delay in meconium passage. In addition, maternal drug use, such as illicit drugs, magnesium sulfate and ganglionic blocking agents, can affect the infant and interfere with the passage of meconium. Neonatal medical conditions that can be associated with a failure to pass meconium include - hypothyroidism, - hypercalcemia, - hypokalemia, - sepsis and - congestive heart failure.",

If the bony connection between the inferior and superior aiculating facets (pars interaicularis) is defective, the weight of the body may cause the upper veebra, including all of the veebral bodies above it, to slip forward for varying amounts on the body below (spondylolisthesis) The defect in the pars interaicularis is called spondylolysis Spondylolysis is not present at bih but increases in frequency with increasing age. When symptomatic, pain is the most frequent symptom of either spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis There are several different etiologies for spondylolisthesis: Spondylolytic spondylolisthesis is the most common type and results from bilateral defects in the pars interaicularis. Degenerative spondylolisthesis -Most frequent at the L4-L5 level It is not the result of a pars defect but a complex interaction between the disk, facets joints and the ligamentous structures Dysplastic spondylolisthesis-Results from congenital abnormalities of the body and/or facets in the lumbar region such that the alignment of the facets allows spondylolisthesis to occur. The pars may or may not be intact Traumatic spondylolisthesis-Trauma can lead to an acute fracture through a normal pars interaicularis.

Injection sclerotherapy is used in varicose veins less than 3mm diameter and in telangiectatic vessels. Commonly used sclerosing agents are hypeonic saline, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, and polidocanol. Patients with symptomatic great or small saphenous vein reflux may be treated with endovenous ablation techniques or surgical removal.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Malignancy Pseudocysts of the pancreas are collections of pancreatic juice surrounded by a wall of fibrous tissue that is not lined by epithelium. Pseudocysts are connected with the pancreatic duct system either as a direct communication or indirectly the pancreatic parenchyma. They are caused by pancreatic ductal disruption following increased pancreatic ductal pressure either due to stenosis, calculi or protein plugs obstructing the main pancreatic ductal system or as a result of pancreatic necrosis following an attack of acute pancreatitis. Complications of pseudocysts in chronic pancreatitis are: Rupture into the gastrointestinal tract either results in no symptoms or leads to melaena or haematemesis that usually requires urgent conservative measures. Rupture into the general peritoneal cavity results in features of peritonitis and on occasions an associated haemorrhagic shock. Haemorrhage can greatly complicate the course of a pseudocyst. Interventional radiology can play an invaluable role both in locating the source of bleeding and in embolisation of the bleeding vessel. Infection occurs either spontaneously or after therapeutic or diagnostic manipulations. Biliary complications occur due to a large cyst in the pancreatic head region obstructing the common bile duct and resulting in obstructive jaundice. Poal hypertension can result from compression or obstruction of the splenic vein/ poal vein either by the cyst alone or in conjunction with underlying chronic pancreatitis.",

D: 3 The Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS, also known as the Glasgow Coma Score is a neurological scale which aims to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person, for initial as well as continuing assessment. The scale comprises three tests: eye, verbal and motor responses. The three values separately as well as their sum are considered. The lowest possible GCS is 3 (deep coma or death), while the highest is 15 (fully awake person). Best eye response (E) There are 4 grades staing with the most severe: - No eye opening Eye opening in response to pain. (Patient responds to pressure on the patient's fingernail bed; if this does not elicit a response, supraorbital and sternal pressure or rub may be used.) - Eye opening to speech. (Not to be confused with an awaking of a sleeping person; such patients receive a score of 4, not 3.) - Eyes opening spontaneously Best verbal response (V) There are 5 grades staing with the most severe: - No verbal response - Incomprehensible sounds. (Moaning but no words.) Inappropriate words. (Random or exclamatory aiculated speech, but no conversational exchange) - Confused. (The patient responds to questions coherently but there is some disorientation and confusion.) - Oriented. (Patient responds coherently and appropriately to questions such as the patient's name and age, where they are and why, the year, month, etc.) Best motor response (M) There are 6 grades staing with the most severe: - No motor response - Extension to pain (adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm, extension of wrist, decerebrate response) Abnormal flexion to pain (adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm, flexion of wrist, decoicate response) - Flexion/ Withdrawal to pain (flexion of elbow, supination of forearm, flexion of wrist when supra-orbital pressure applied; pulls pa of body away when nailbed pinched) - Localizes to pain. (Purposeful movements towards painful stimuli; e. g., hand crosses mid-line and gets above clavicle when supra-orbital pressure applied.) - Obeys commands. (The patient does simple things as asked.) Interpretation Individual elements as well as the sum of the score are impoant. Hence; the score is expressed in the form \"GCS 9 = E2 V4 M3 Severity of head injury: Severe: GCS 3-8 Moderate: GCS 9 - 13 Mild head injury: GCS 14-15 with loss of consciousness (LOC) Minor: GCS 15 with no LOC The GCS has limited applicability to children, especially below the age of 36 months (where the verbal performance of even a healthy child would be expected to be poor).

        "question": "A 68 yr old man came with pain and swelling of right knee. Ahlback grade 2 osteoahritic changes were found on investigation. What is the fuher management?",
        "exp": "Conservative [Ref: Campbell Operative Ohopaedics 11/e, p 916; Apley's Ohopaedics 9/e, p 572573; Turek's Ohopedics 6/e, p 616-621; Imaging of the knee: Techniques & application by A. Mark Davies et al 2003, p 12; Harrison 17/e, p 2163-21651 Initial management of most of the patients of knee OA is conservative or non-operative. Campbell operative ohopaedics writes? \"Osteoahritis of the knee can cause symptoms ranging from mild to disabiling. Initial management of most patients should be nonoperative\". Surgical management is needed when the conservative management fails. Surgical management in brief: The choice of surgical procedure depends on the patient's age and activity demand, severity of the disease and the number of knee compaments involved. Ahroscopic washout or debridement: - It consists of trimming of degenerate meniscal tissue and osteophytes - It may delay the need for a more definitive procedure, especially in younger, active patients with localised degenerative ahritis that causes pain at rest without malalignment or instability - It may also be considered in active, older adults with mild to moderate OA Realignment osteotomy: High or proximal tibial osteotomy (HTO)? High tibial osteotomy is a procedure for the treatment of unicompamental osteoahritis of the knee (medial or lateral compament osteoahritis; usually it is medial; lateral compament osteoahritis is uncommon). Medial osteoahritis is associated with varus deformity of the knee. Varus deformity causes stresses to be concentrated medially, accelerating degenerative changes in the medial pa of the joint (similarly if the deformity is of valgus position, changes are accelerated in the lateral pa). The biomechanical rationale for proximal tibial osteotomy in patients with unicompamental osteoahritis of the knee is \"unloading\" of the involved joint compament by correcting the malalignment and redistributing the stresses on the knee joint. Thus medial osteoahritis is treated by a varus correcting osteotomy (k/a valgus osteotomy) and the uncommon lateral osteoahritis corrected by valugus correcting osteotomy (k/a varus osteotomy). According to Ebnezar (3/e p547) High tibial osteotomy is done for varus deformity less than 15deg and valgus deformity less than 12deg. Supracondylar or distal femoral osteotomy? - distal femoral osteotomy is done for correction of valgus deformity more than 12 to 15deg (Ref Campbell's Ohopaedics 1/e chapter 25) Total knee ahroplasty: - It is done for older patients with advanced OA that causes incapacitating pain and disability or young patients with tricompamental (medial and lateral tibio femoral and patellofemoral) disease. But it should be delayed in young patients as long as possible as prostheses may wear out over time and may need fuher revision surgery. Unicompamental ahroplasty: - In carefully selected patients with either medial or lateral osteoahritis, it is becoming a ble alternative to TKA and HTO. Knee ahrodesis: - Ahrodesis is indicated less commonly than ahroplasty. If the patient is young and involved in heavy occupation, ahrodesis is indicated to give him a stable and strong knee. - This procedure provides permanent pain relief and allows the patient to return to durable, active work. However ahrodesis results in a stiff knee which is a severe disability. Ahlback's grading of osteoahritis Ahlback's grading is radiological grading of osteoahritis. Standard textbooks of Ohopaedics (Campbell, Turek, Apley's) and of Radiology (Grainger, Sutton, Greenspan's Ohopedic Imaging) do not mention anything about it. Treatment of osteoahritis depends on symptoms and clinical profile of pt and not on radiological grading. Still we are describing the grading below. Grading of osteoahritis Apa from Ahlback grading, other commonly used grading system is by Kellgren and Lawrence. The two grading system are compared as follows: Classification of knee OA Ahlback Kellgren and Lawrence Grade Definition Grade Definition Grade 1 \"doubtful\" Minute osteophytes doubtful significant Grade 2 \"minimal\" Definite osteophytes (unimpaired air space) Grade 1 Joint space narrowing (< 3 mm) Grade 3 \"moderate\" Moderate diminution of joint spaces Grade 2 Joint space obliferation Grade 4 \" severe \" Joint space great impaired with sclerosis of subchondral bone Grade 3 Minor bone attrition (0-5 mm) Grade 4 Same as above Grade 4 Moderate bone attrition (5-10 mm) Grade 4 As above Grade 5 Severe bone attrition (> 10 mm) Grade 4 As above Note- Grade I of Ahlback is equivalent to grade 3 of Kellgren and Lawrence& grade 2, 3, 4&5 of Ahlback is equivalent to grade 4 of Kellgren and Lawrence. It must be noted that the radiological grading may not correlate with clinical symptomology of the patients. The treatment is based on the symptoms of patient (and not merely on radiographic appearances)",

The basic abnormality in Ehler's Danlos syndrome (EDS) is some defect in the synthesis or structure of collagen Biosynthesis of collagen is a complex process It involves numerous structural collagen genes or enzymes. Which are used in post transcriptional modification of collagen. Therefore it can be disturbed by no. of genetic errors that may affect any of the numerous genes or enzymes necessary for collagen synthesis. At the molecular level, a variety of defects, varying. from mutations involving structural genes or collagens to those involving enzymes that are responsible for post transcriptional modification of m. RNA have been detected. Such molecular heterogenecity result in expression of EDS as a clinically variable disorder with several patterns of inheritance. On the basis of clinical and molecular characteristics six variants of Ehler's Danlos syndrome have been identified. The common thread in all forms of EDS is some abnormality in the synthesis of collagen. Clinical features - As might be expected tissues rich in collagen such as skin, ligaments and joints are frequently involved. - Because the abnormal collagen fibre lacks adequate tensile strength, skin is hyper extensible and the joints are hypermobile. The skin is extraordinarily stretchaeble, extremely fragile and vulnerable to trauma. - Minor injuries produce gaping defects and surgical repair or intervention is accomplished with great difficulty because of the lack of normal tensile strength. - The defect in connective tissue may lead to serious internal complications which include:? - Rupture of the colon and large aeries - Occular. fragility with rupture of cornea and retinal detachment - Diaphragmatic hernia EQS type Gene defect Inheritance Clinical findings Classical Defect in type V collagen Mutation in COL5A gene Autosomal dominant Skin and joint hypermo? bility, atrophic scars, Easy bruising Hypermobility Unknow Autosomal dominant Joint hypennobility, pain, dislocations Vascular Defect in collagen type 111 Autosomal The skin, aerial or Collagen ill is abundant in Blood vessels and intestine ( *.. severe defect of these organs dominants uterine rupture, bru? ising, small joint hyperextensibility Kyphoscoliosis Reduced level of lysyl hydroxylase essential for cross linking of collagen fibres Autosomal recessive Hypotonia, joint laxity, congenital scoliosis, ocular fragility Ahrochalasia - Defect in conversion of Autosomal Severe joint hypenno?

Therefore affected newborn infants appear \"prematurely aged\". The skin abnormality is most prominent around eye, face neck. Therefore patients with cutis laxa have characteristic facial features including an aged appearance with sagging jaws (blood hound appearance) a hooked nose with eveed nostrils, a sho columella, a long upper lip and eveed lower eyelids. Hypermobility of the joint is not present. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum It is a rare group of disorders affecting the elastic tissue. It primarily affects the dermis, retina, and cardiovascular system.

These patients should also undergo routine central neck node removal and modified radical neck dissection when lateral neck nodes are palpable (similar to patients with medullary carcinoma). Although RAI scanning and ablation usually are ineffective, they probably should be considered for ablation of any residual normal thyroid tissue and, occasionally, for ablation of tumors, because there is no other good therapy.",

        "question": "A child comes with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome secondary to FSGS. not responsive to methylprednisolone. What next should be given a. EUR'",
        "exp": "Oral cyclosporine [Ref. Indian society of pediatric nephrology (MIMS) Dr. Arvind Bagga Aicle from Indian Journal of pediatrics volume 46 January 17, 20091 There is a lack of evidence based guidelines for management of children with steroid resistant nephritic syndrome (SRNS). - Expes of the Indian society of peadiatric nephrology were involved in two stage process and gave the following guidelines:? Definitions of coicosteroid resistant nephrotic syndrome A patient is diagnosed to have steroid resistance if there is lack of remission despite treatment with prednisolone at a dose of 2 nig/kg/day (60 mg/m2/day) for 4 weeks. Remission is defined as absence of proteinuria (urine albumin nil or trace for three consecutive days by dipstick or boiling test). - Following treatment with daily prednisolone, 95% patients with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome achieve remission by the. first 4 weeks and an additional 3% in additional 4 weeks. Prolonged cources of daily coicosteroids are associated with increased incidence of side effects. Therefore, defining SRNS as lack of remission despite 4 weeks treatment with daily prednisolone is reasonable. - This definition is in conformity with that used by the Cochrane Renal Group. The national Institutes of Health (USA) trial on patients with steroid resistant. focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) has accepted a similar definition. All children with SRNS, whether initial or late. should undergo a renal biopsy before instituting specific treatment. Despite absence of evidence based recommendations regarding the role of renal biopsy in patients with SRNS, this procedure provides impoant information on renal histology and outcome. Most patients with steroid sensitive nephritic syndrome (90%) show minimal change nephritic syndrome on renal histology. - The renal histology in SRNS is different, with 30-40% patients each showing minimal change nephritic syndrome and FSGS, and a smaller group with mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (8). The response to therapy is determined by renal histology; patients with minimal change nephritic syndrome show satisfactory response to therapy, while presence of FSGS or chronic tubulointerstitial changes is associated with unsatisfactory outcomes. A renal biopsy is also necessary before initiating treatment with potentially nephrotoxic agents, especially cyclospo- rine or tacrolimus. Mutational Analysis Studies for mutations of genes involved in synthesis of podocyte protein are not routinely necessary in children with SRNS. Where facilities exist, mutational analysis may be offered to patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome (onset below 3 months of age), initial steroid resistance and family history of a SRNS). - Mutations in the genes encoding various podocyte proteins, including podocin (NHHS2) and nephrin (NPHS1), have been described in a variable propoion of patients with familial and sporadic SRNS. - The likelihood of detecting a mutation is higher in patients with family history of nephrotic syndrome or its onset in infancy. Patients with mutations involving these genes often do not respond to immunosuppressive medications and show progressive kidney disease. - In view of lack of data in Indian children, routine mutational analysis in patients with initial SRNS is not recommended. Patients with late steroid resistance have not been. found to have genetic mutations. Principles of therapy Patients with idiopathic SRNS secondary to minimal change nephrotic syndrome, FSGS and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis should receive similar therapy. Review of the of the literature suggests that patients with steroid resistance secondary to minimal change nephrotic syndrome are more likely to achieve remission and have a better prognosis compared to other histological types. However, a systemic review by the Cochrane Renal Group showed similar outcome in patients with steroid resistant minimal outcome in patients with steroid resistant minimal change nephrotic syndrome and FSGS who were treated with cyclosporine or cyclophosphamide. - There is not clear evidence to suppo that patients with minimal change nephrotic syndrome and FSGS should be treated differently. Specific treatment The aim of therapy is induction of remission while avoiding medication related toxicity. The option for treatment for patients with idiopathic SRNS include:? Cakineurin inhibitors with tapering doses of alternate day steroids:? Cyclosporine - Tacrolimus Cvclophosphamide oral and I. V. with tapering doses of alternate day steroids. Pulse coicosteroids -high dose intravenous steroids (dexamethasone, methyl- prednisolone) with oral cyclophosphamide and tapering alternate day steroids. There is lack of consensus on the most appropriate first line therapy for children with SRNS, with many of the regimens extrapolated from studies in adults. - The level of evidence on efficacies of available regimens is summarized below. \"From these evidences calcineurin inhibitors i. e. cyclosporine and Tacrolimus seems to be the most effective drugs for steroid resistant nephritic syndrome\". An impoant point There is still lack of consensus on first line appropriate therapy for steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome.",

Measurement of spinal fluid protein is helpful in the diagnosis; protein levels are increased to more than twice normal, while glucose and cell counts are normal. Hospitalization for observation is indicated. Treatment can consist of intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, or plasmapheresis. Recovery is not always complete.

This is not possible in CTEV. This is known as 'clorsillexion test' and can be used as a screening test. Ahrogryposis Multiplex Congenita is a rare congenital disorder that is characterized by multiple joint contractures and muscle atrophy and fibrosis. It is a non-progressive disease. CTEV can be seen as one of the components of AMC. So AMC can also be the answer but since it's much rarer than CTEV and in the question other joints involvement is not mentioned, answer would be `CTEV'. Congenital veical talus is a'rare disease usually affecting both feet, characterized by rigid flatfoot deformity, with the plantar aspect of the foot having a convex contour. The heel is in valgus, and the forefoot is abducted and dorsiflexed. In the newborn having this condition, the dorsal aspect of the foot may be in close approximation to the distal aspect of tibia. Flat foot or Pes planus is a condition characterized by varying degrees of loss of the longitudinal arch of the foot. This condition can be normal which usually disappears as the child grows, or can be pathological as seen in Congenital veical talus, tarsal coalition, inflammatory joint disorder or a neurological disorder. Congenital Talipes Equinovarus (Idiopathic club-food -Talipes is a term for any foot deformity that centres around the talus. - Equinus implies that the foot is flexed in the plantar direction. - Varus implies that the foot is inveed and adducted so that the sole faces inwards. CTEV is a complex deformity of the foot where the foot is both turned and twisted inwards so that the sole faces posteromedially. Deformities noted are: - plantar flexion (equines) - in version - adduction - supination - sometimes cavus (high medial arch) The involved foot is generally smaller than the opposite side with varying amounts of calf atrophy. More common in boys (2: 1) Bilateral in 1/3 cases. (Ret Apley's Ohopaedics 11/e 591) Clinical tests in CTEV: 1). Dorsiflexion test: described above. 2). Plumbline test: This test helps to detect the tibial torsion. The child is made to sit on a table with both the lower limbs hanging from the edge. A line drawn from the centre of the patella to the tibial tubercle when extended down, should cut the foot at the first or second intermetatarsal space normally. This is called the pulmline. In CTEV, with medial rotation of the tibia. the plumbline cuts the zith or 5th intermetatarsal space. 3). Scratch test: This test is performed to detect muscle imbalance in an infant who cannot obey commands. - Medial scratch test- In a normal child when the medial sole is scratched, the foot eves. The tests the peroneals. - Lateral scratch test- When the lateral sole is scratched, the child inves the foot. This tests the inveors. X-ray: Radiographs AP and Lateral are obtained in maximally corrected position. The talo-calcaneal angle (Kite's angle) obtained in both AP and lateral views is reduced in CTEV.",

ANA are a specific class of autoantibodics that have the capability of binding and destroying ceain structures within the nucleus of the cells. Not only are these antibodies involved in the disease pathogenesis, but they also constitute the basis for diagnosis and treatment of CTD. Their detection with high sensitivity and specificity is therefore of utmost impoance. Although a battery of laboratory tests are available for ANA detection indirect immunofluorescence antinuclear antibody test (IF-ANA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA)/enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) arc commonly used in day to day practice.

Which of the following is the most likely pathogenetic mechanism of this condition?",
        "exp": "Paget disease, also known as osteitis deformans, is a frequent bone condition affecting middle-aged to elderly persons. Usually polyostotic, it affects the axial skeleton, including the spine, pelvis, proximal femur, and head. Often, it presents with gradual enlargement of the head and chronic bone pain. Affected bone is thickened and coarse, with disorderly osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. Paget himself proposed a viral hypothesis for the pathogenesis of this condition, but only recent immunologic and molecular techniques have allowed identification of paramyxoviruses (measles and respiratory syncytial virus) in osteoclasts of affected bones. In most cases, the diagnosis can be made by radiologic investigations. Generalized reduction in bone mass is the defining feature of osteoporosis. In its most common form, the condition affects elderly persons, especially women after menopause. It characteristically causes compression fractures of veebral bones or pathologic fractures of the femoral neck. Genetic deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II is one cause of the rare hereditary disorders collectively known as osteopetrosis, which are due to osteoclast dysfunction. This condition manifests in infancy or childhood with bone fragility and recurrent fractures. The bone has a stony hard consistency, but is brittle. Monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells is the underlying cause of multiple myeloma, the most frequent primary bone neoplasm. Multiple myeloma results in multifocal accumulation of neoplastic plasma cells in bones, manifesting with punched-out osteolytic lesions on x-ray films. Veebrae, skull, ribs and pelvic bones are most frequently affected.",

Superficial heating modalities include: - hot water bottle - chemical packs warm bath - paraffin wax bath - hot packs (eg. Kenny pack) - moist air cabinet - hot soaks or compresses - infrared lamp Deep heat therapy Deeper structures (including muscles) are heated In general, the transfer of heat is of three types - conduction, convection & conversion (or radiation) Whereas superficial heating modalities use all three modes of transfer of heat; deep heating modalities use only conversion or radiation method to heat the deep tissues. Deep heating modalities are a. Sho wave diathermy - heat generated by high frequency alternating current using a sho-wave diathermy emitter. b.

Hirschsprung's disease/ congenital aganglionic megacolon, involves an enlargement of the colon, caused by bowel obstruction resulting from an aganglionic section of bowel (the normal enteric nerves are absent) that stas at the anus and progresses upwards. The most cited feature is absence of ganglion cells: notably in males, 75% have none in the recto-sigmoid, and 8% with none in the entire colon. The enlarged section of the bowel is found proximally, while the narrowed, aganglionic section is found distally; the absence of ganglion cells results in a persistent over-stimulation of nerves within the affected region, resulting in contraction. Delayed passage of meconium. 'abdominal distension. Constipation. Suspect Hirschsprung's in a baby who has not passed meconium within 48 hours of delivery.

It used to be found exclusively in men, but recently there has been an increase in the number of repoed cases in women. The vessels primarily affected are in the extremities, and this leads to painful ischemia and gangrene of the legs and arms due to thrombosis. Histologic sections reveal an acute inflammatory infiltrate involving the entire wall of the vessel. In contrast to atherosclerosis, small microabscesses may be seen within thrombi. The inflammation leads to intimal proliferation that obliterates the lumen and causes pain. The disease may regress on cessation of smoking. In contrast, granulomatous inflammation with giant cells involving blood vessels can be seen with temporal aeritis or. Takayasu's aeritis.

If the limb is ischemic, a temporary intraluminal shunt is inserted to maintain distal perfusion during the orthopedic procedure. \"",

Local bleeding and swelling (intracranial or extracranial) produce an increase in the intracranial pressure. A characteristic symptom pattern occurs initiated by progressive depression of mental status. Increasing intracranial pressure tends to displace brain tissue away from the source of the pressure; if the pressure is sufficient, herniation of the uncal process through the tentorium cerebri occurs. Pupillary dilation is caused by compression of the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve and its parasympathetic fibers. If the pressure is not relieved, the contralateral oculomotor nerve will become involved and, ultimately, the brainstem will herniate through the foramen magnum and cause death. Hypertension and bradycardia are preterminal events. Emergency measures to reduce intracranial pressure while preparing for localization of the clot or for a craniotomy or both include hyperventilation, dexamethasone (Decadron), and mannitol infusion. Of these, hyperventilation produces the most rapid decrease in brain swelling.",

Other pathogens implicated infrequently include Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Candida spp. and Salmonella spp. Most mild cases of AAD are due to non-infectious causes which include reduced break down of primary bile acids and decrease metabolism of carbohydrates, allergic or toxic effects of antibiotic on intestinal mucosa and pharmacological effect on gut motility. The antibiotics most frequently associated with C. difficile associated diarrhoea are clindamycin, cephalosporin, ampicillin and amoxicillin. Clinical presentation may vary from mild diarrhoea to severe colitis and pseudomembranous colitis associated with high morbidity and moality. The most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for C. difficile infection is tissue culture assay for cytotoxicity of toxin B. Commercial ELISA kits are available. Though less sensitive, they are easy to perform and are rapid. Withdrawal of precipitating antibiotic is all that is needed for control of mild to moderate cases. For severe cases of AAD, oral metronidazole is the first line of treatment, and oral vancomycin is the second choice.",

Common examples of this type being septic, anaphylactic and neurogenic shock. Septic shock It includes vasodilatation, high cardiac output, and loss of intravascular volume due to 'leaky capillaries'. The patient may sta with a low cardiac output due to the leaky capillaries with loss of fluid and because the vasodilated aerial tree requires a larger blood volume to fill it (relative hypovolaemia). With appropriate fluid volume replacement the heart will pump against lower resistance and therefore there will often be an increase in cardiac output in order to compensate for the reduction in SVR. The patient may remain hypotensive but will have warm peripheries and a bounding pulse. The bounding pulse is a reflection of the wide pulse pressure which is due to a low diastolic pressure. Due to toxins and acidosis, sepsis may have a negative inotropic affect on the heart as well as causing vasodilatation and the patient can therefore have a low cardiac output and a low SVR.",

Meconium peritonitis is due to intestinal perforation mostly the result of some form of neonatal intestinal obstruction (eg. meconium ileus in cystic fibrosis patients). When meconium enters the peritoneal cavity, an exudate is secreted that organizes rapidly, matting of intestinal loops occur, and in many cases in a matter of weeks, the extruded becomes calcified. Meconium remains sterile until about 3 hrs after birth; thereafter, unless the perforation has become sealed, sterile meconium peritonitis gives place to acute bacterial peritonitis which unless treated promptly is rapidly fatal. The clinical picture may be that of peritonitis and/or intestinal obstruction. Meconium peritonitis should always be suspected when a baby is born with a tense abdomen, who is vomiting and in whom there is a failure to discharge meconium.

Small aerioles in the aforementioned systems show obliteration caused by intimal hyperplasia accompanied by progressive interstitial fibrosis. * In the skin, the changes begin in the fingers and hands and consist of sclerotic atrophy, which is characterized by increased dermal collagen, epidermal atrophy, and loss of skin adnexal structures. Two antinuclear antibodies are unique to systemic sclerosis. * One is Scl-70, which is found in diffuse progressive systemic sclerosis, and the other is an anticentromere antibody found in the CREST syndrome, a variant of progressive systemic sclerosis. * The CREST syndrome is characterized by calcinosis, Raynaud's syndrome (episodic ischemia of digits), esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia. Pulmonary hypertension and primary biliary cirrhosis are common in the CREST syndrome, but the kidneys are usually spared. * In contrast to the histologic findings with systemic sclerosis, a conjunctival biopsy that reveals noncaseating granulomas is suggestive of sarcoidosis; * Failure of the tibia to rotate during extension indicates a meniscal lesion or cruciate ligament involvement.

Symptoms of Bladder outlet obstruction and back pains (due to bony metastasis in the pelvis & lumbar veebra) indicate towards prostate Ca. Serum acid phosphatase is a tumor marker of prostate Ca. But now serum acid phosphatase assay has been superseeded by PSA assay (Prostate specific antigen). Prostate specific antigen It is a glycoprotein produced only in the prostatic cells (both benign & malignant). It facilitates liquefaction of semen. It is neither sensitive nor specific for early prostate carcinoma (it is prostate specific and not prostate cancer specific), neveheless it gives some help in making a diagnosis. * Normal serum level ----> less than 4 ng/ml* * 4 - 10 ng/ml ----> this range is common for both BHP and Ca.* * More than 10 ng/ml --> approx 75% will have cancer.* Since PSA is not specific for Ca, PSA Velocity & PSA density are used to detect Prostate cancer. PSA velocity is the rate of change in PSA levels over time and is expressed most commonly as the PSA doubling time. For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than. 75 ng/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0. 5 ng/mL per year should be used to advise biopsy. PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level. - Values < 0. 10 are consistent with BPH. - > 0. 15 suggest cancer",

        "exp": "C i. e. Movement of TT towards lateral border of patella Tibial tuberosity is in line with midline of patellaQ at 90deg of knee flexion. However, when the knee is extended fully the TT moves laterally towards the lateral border of patella because of screw home mechanism (i. e. lateral rotation of tibia in non weight bearing or medial rotation of femur in weight bearing individuals). The Q. (quadriceps or patello-femoral) angle provides a concomitant lateral (valgus) force on patella which tends to make the patella track laterally. These last few degree of motion lock the knee in extension & referred to as screw home mechanism. With the knee fully extended, an individual can stand for a long time with out using muscles. The knee must be unlocked by the femur rotating laterally on tibia (by popliteus) for knee flexion to occur. Law of valgus: Because the femur normally runs slightly obliquely inwards, the Q (quadriceps) angle (i. e. angle that patellar tendon makes relative to shaft of femur) is formed, with its concomitant tendency to pull the patella laterally. This predisposition for lateral motion of patella is referred to as the law of valgus. Since the patella is relatively free to move upon the femur when the knee is extended. When the quadriceps femoris muscle contracts it will try to establish a straight line between its proximal attachment onto the femur & pelvis and its distal attachment onto the tibial tuberosity. Thus the Q angle provides an indication of the lateral force (vector) applied to the patella, which tends to make the patella track laterallyQ in order to establish a straight line relationship between the proximal & distal attachment of quadriceps femoris muscle group during extension. Q (patello-femoral or quadriceps) angle is the angle between the quadriceps muscle, primarily the rectus femoris muscle & the patellar tendon. It is determined by drawing a line from ASIS (anterior superior iliac spine) to the midpoint of patella and from tibial tuberosity to mid point of patella. Although the rectus femoris attaches to AIIS (anterior inferior iliac spine), the ASIS lies just above AIIS and is easier to palpate. Normally it is 13-18deg in knee extension.",

Pain and temperature are carried by lateral spinothalmic tracts, which cross the central pa of the cord sholy after entering the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral side. Fine touch and proprioception are carried in dorsal column fibres which do not cross the cord until medulla. Since fibers conducting pain and temperature sensation cross the cord in the anterior commissure, a lesion in this location will characteristically abolish these modalities on one or both sides over several segments but will spare the tactile sensation (fine touch and proprioception). This is known as dissociated sensory loss and is a characteristic feature of the Central spinal cord syndrome (Syringomyelic Syndrome).

The process is: (1) isolation of DNA from parent/child or forensicspecimens using blood, skin, or semen; (2) PCR amplification and radioactive labeling of DNA from variable regions in each sample; (3) separation of the variable DNA fragments by gel electrophoresis; and (4) comparison of the DNA fragment patterns among samples. Since numbers of arrays of repeats of two, three, or four base pairs (microsatellites) may vary from 5 to 100 at a paicular chromosome locus, paicular alleles may occur in less than 1% of the population. As a result, analysis of three loci, each with two alleles, can produce odds as high as (100)6 that the pattern matches a putative father or suspect as compared to a random person from the general population. Reverse transcription based upon RNA-directed DNA synthesis is not utilized in DNA fingerprinting, and the size distribution of undigested DNA reflects its integrity during isolation rather than individual identify. HLA typing uses antibodies to define the constellation of alleles from various loci in the HLA region on chromosome 6. The tendency for ceain HLA alleles to occur together (associate) on the same chromosome as haplotypes greatly reduces their odds of identity when compared to DNA fingerprinting.",

Other bacteria identified definitively as triggers of ReA include several Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Clinical Features The clinical manifestations of ReA constitute a spectrum that ranges from an isolated, transient monahritis to severe multisystem disease. The joints of the lower extremities, especially the knee, ankle, and subtalar, metatarsophalangeal, and toe interphalangeal joints, are the most common sites of involvement, Dactylitis, or \"sausage digit, \" a diffuse swelling of a solitary finger or toe, is a distinctive feature of ReA. Tendinitis and fasciitis are paicularly characteristic lesions Urogenital lesions: In males: urethritis may be marked or relatively asymptomatic. Prostatitis is also common. In Females: cervicitis or salpingitis Ocular: transient, asymptomatic conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis Mucocutaneous lesions: Oral ulcers, the characteristic skin lesions- keratoderma blenorrhagica, consist of vesicles that become hyperkeratotic, ultimately forming a crust before disappearing. They are most common on the palms and soles, Lesions on the glans penis, termed circinate balanitis, are common Management: Most patients with ReA benefit to some degree from NSAIDs, although acute symptoms are rarely completely ameliorated, and some patients fail to respond at all. Indomethacin, 75-150 mg/d in divided doses, is the initial treatment of choice, but other NSAIDs may be tried. Prompt, appropriate antibiotic treatment of acute chlamydial urethritis or enteric infection may prevent the emergence of ReA. However, several controlled trials have failed to demonstrate any benefit for antibiotic therapy that is initiated after onset of ahritis",

        "exp": "Acute fulminant liver failure for any cause Following arc the types of liver transplantation: Cadaver donor transplantation: The donor liver is obtained from a person who is diagnosed as brain dead whose family volunteers to donate the organ for transplantation. Living donor transplant: A healthy family member or a volunteer donates pa of his liver for transplantation. Ohotropic liver transplant: it involves the replacement of the patient's diseased liver with the donor's liver. Auxiliary liver transplant Auxiliary transplantation (A-OLTX): Here the patient's liver is not removed. Pa of the liver of a healthy adult donor (living or cadaver) is transplanted into the recipient, alongside pa of the patient's own liver. Auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation is theoretically attractive because it leaves the recipient's liver in place. The surgical trauma of hepatectomy is avoided, and failure of the graft does not necessarily lead to the death of the patient or a second, emergency transplantation. Another advantage is that matching the body sizes of the donor and the recipient is not mandatory, which increases the number of possible donors The following aicle-\"Auxiliary Paial Ohotopic Living Donor Liver Transplantation: Kyoto University Experience\" (at the. following website latp://www. inedscape. combiewaicle/500102) mentions four indications for auxiliary paial ohotopic liver transplantation: reversible fulminant hepatic failure non-cirrhotic metabolic liver disease snzall-for-size grafts for ABO-incompatibility Fultninant hepatic failure: Total ohotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) is a lifesaving therapeutic option for patients with FI-1F, but requires lifelong immunosuppression to maintain the graft. Auxiliary paial ohotopic liver transplantation whereby only a poion of the native liver is removed, and the remainder of the native liver is left in situ, provides temporary suppo until the native liver recovers and then immunosuppression can be withdrawn. The advantage claimed for APOLT in non-cirrhotic metabolic liver disease (most commonly Crigler-Najjar syndrome) is that it can compensate for enzyme deficiencies without complete removal of the native liver, which may have to aid the recipient in case of potential graft failure. The remaining native liver could benefit in the future from potential success in gene treatment Transplants of ABO-incompatible grafts are often unavoidable due to the limited number of potential donor candidates. A high incidence of early graft failure with a high rate of binary and vascular complications in ABOincompatible liver transplantation was repoed. The remnant native liver could sustain a patient's life if the anticipated graft failure occurred in an ABO-incompatible case. The rationale of APOLT for a small-for-size graft is that the remnant native liver is expected to suppo the function of the implanted graft during the early post-operative period. The graft liver expands its function in propoion to volume growth. After the graft liver has grown sufficiently, it can be expected to meet the hepatic functional demands of the recipient. The following aicle \"Auxiliary paial liver transplantation for end-stage chronic liver disease\" in The New England Journal of Medicine Volume 319: 1507-1511. December 8, 1988. Nutnber 23 (at the following website gi/content/abstract/319/23/1507) mentions another indication for A-OLTX - End-stage chronic liver disease who are high-risk patients. These patients are not accepted for ohotopic liver transplantation because of massive ascites, deficient clotting function, cachexia, or poor pulmonary reserve. So we see that all the options except 'b' are indications for A-OLTX We have chosen acute liver ds. as the answer as it's the probably the most common indication as evident by maximum number of aicles on the net describing A-OLTX for acute liver failure. This book -\"Atlas of Upper Gastrointestinal and Hepato-Pancrato-Biliary surgery- publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg \" mentions only acute liver failure as an indication for A-OLTX.",

Endemic: When the infectious agent has taken a foothold in a population which is naturally and, paially protected because of occurrence of the disease over a period. Examples are typhoid, diphtheria and infective hepatitis. When the incidence rises due to changes in the agent, host or environment factors, it becomes an epidemic. 7. Sporadic: When only isolated cases are repoed here and there, now and then. This may happen in case of meningitis and poliomyelitis. 8. Pandemic: When an epidemic appears simultaneously or successively in more than one country, e. g., the swine Flu pandemic 2009.",

The fracture is dorsally displaced and may be comminuted. The fracture pattern is often described as a silver or dinner-fork deformity. Two classification systems are used: The Association for Osteosynthesis (AO) system The Frykman system. Complications of the Colles fracture include: Post-traumatic stiffness Mal-union Subluxation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint Acute carpal tunnel syndrome Sudeck's osteodystrophy. Rupture of the extensor pollicis longus tendon B. An impact to the dorsum of the hand or a hyperflexion or hypersupination injury results in Smith's fracture. A Smith fracture is usually called a reverse Colles fracture because the distal fragment is displaced volarly. It is often described as a garden-spade deformity. C. Baon fractures are classified as dorsal or palmar (always intra-aicular), and they always involve carpal subluxation. The volar Baon fracture is thought to occur with the same mechanism as the Smith fracture, with more force and loading on the wrist. The dorsal Baon fracture is caused by a fall on an extended and pronated wrist, increasing carpal compression force on the dorsal rim. The salient feature is a subluxation of the wrist. By definition, this fracture has some degree of carpal displacement, which distinguishes it from a Colles or Smith fracture. The palmar variety is more common than the dorsal type. D. The chauffeur's fracture derives its name from injuries that were acquired, in the days when motor vehicles were cranked, when a vehicle backfired. The force is described as a direct axial compression of the scaphoid into the radial facet. The radial styloid is fractured, with associated avulsion of the radial collateral ligament. A chauffeur's fracture represents an avulsion related to the attachment sites of the radiocarpal ligaments or of the radial collateral ligament. E. Galeazzi fracture results from a FOOSH mechanism with the forearm hyperpronated or from a direct impact to the dorsal radial wrist. The radial diaphysis at the distal and middle third junction is fractured, with associated subluxation of the distal radioulnar joint. On PA views, the radius is shoened and the radioulnar joint is disrupted. On the lateral view, the distal radius is angulated either volarly or radially as a result of the pull of the brachioradialis muscle with more than 3 mm of ulnar displacement. F. The Essex-Lopresti fracture consists of a comminuted and displaced radial head fracture along with disruption of the distal radioulnar joint and interosseous membrane.",

Once again make it clear \"FEV, expressed as percentage (FEV, %) is actually FEV, / FVC. \" If the individual being tested displays a low FEV, and the FEV, % is also low, then the clinician should suspect the presence of obstructive pathologies. In patients with restrictive lung diseases - FVC low - FEV, is also low, (hut there is less reduction in comparison to FVC). Since both of these values may be equally affected in restrictive lung disease the %FEV, is normal or sometimes it is increased because the decrease in FEV, is less compared to decrease in FVC. Hence when % FEV, is between 85% - 100% of the normal and if both FEV, and PVC are low then you should suspect the patient of having restrictive lung disease. Major clues given in the question are:? Decreased DLCO --> (Normal predicted range is 75-120%) Normal FEV1. IFVC --> (Normal predicted range is 88% - 90%) Normal FVC (FVC > 80% is considered normal) Beside these patient is having decrease in oxygen saturation on exercise.

These are Pain -> Dull noncolicky and insidious in onset. Anorexia, nausea General malaise, diarrhea Later on, symptoms result from compression of tubular retroperitoneal structures. The major structure involved are- Ureter - Most commonly involved Aorta Inferior venacava Symptoms due to the involvement of ureter (usually b/1 involvement) Dysuria Frequency of urination Chills and fever occur with secondary infection of a hydronephrotic kidney. Hematuria can occur. Diagnosis The diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis usually can be made accurately by intravenous pyelography if uremia is not present. The characteristic finding on pyelogram are Hydronephrosis with a dilated tortuous upper ureter. Medial deviation of the ureter Extrinsic ureteral compression Note: In a retroperitoneal tumor, ureter is laterally deviated while in retroperitoneal fibrosis ureter medially deviates. Currently, the imaging procedure of choice is the CT scan. But if renal function is compromised contrast agents are not given and then MRI is the procedure of choice. T/T of Retroperitoneal fibrosis Corticosteroids, with or without surgery, are the mainstay of medical therapy.
