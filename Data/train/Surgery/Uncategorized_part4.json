The type of leukocyte that is mainly increased may be an indicator of the type of disease process present. Eosinophilia can be associated with cutaneous allergic reactions; allergic disorders, such as bronchial asthma or hay fever; Hodgkin's disease; some skin diseases, such as pemphigus, eczema, and dermatitis herpetiformis; and parasitic infections, such as trichinosis (caused by infection with trichinella spiralis), schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis. The most common cause of eosinophilia is probably allergy to drugs such as iodides, aspirin, or sulfonamides, but eosinophilia is also seen in collagen vascular diseases. Marked eosinophilia occurs in hypereosinophilic syndromes (Loffler's syndrome and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome), which may be treated with coicosteroids. In contrast, neutrophilic leukocytosis (neutrophilia) may be the result of acute bacterial infections or tissue necrosis, such as is present with myocardial infarction, trauma, or burns. Basophilia is most commonly seen in immediate type (type I) hypersensitivity reactions. Both eosinophils and basophils may be increased in patients with any of the chronic myeloproliferative syndromes. Monocytosis is seen in chronic infections, such as tuberculosis, some collagen vascular diseases, neutropenic states, and some types of lymphomas.

Why is intensive management avoided in diabetes with autonomic neuropathy???. Remember that hypoglycemia due to insulin ingestion is an impoant and dangerous side effect of diabetes therapy (especially in Diabetes type I) Diabetic patients who are on insulin are at an ongoing risk of hypoglycemia due to overingestion of insulin. Severe hypoglycemia can cause serious complications, but founately the patient quickly recognizes the symptoms of hypoglycemia before such serous levels are attained and abos the episodes of hypoglycemia by eating. Symptoms of hypoglycemia are produced due to the release of counterregulatory hormones. This is a physiological response. An intact autonomic nervous system is necessary for this counterragulatoty hormonal responses. So if the autonomic nervous system is not functioning properly patient cannot produce counterregulatory hormonal response, Thus he will not be able to experience hypoglycemia (hypoglycemic unawareness) and thus will not he able to abo the episodes of hypoglycemia. Thus hypoglycemia will reach dangerous levels jeopardizing the life of the patient. \"Advanced adrenergic neuropathy as evidenced by ohostatic hypotension, generally leads to decreased epinephrine secretion after hypoglycemia. Patients with recurrent hypoglycemia unawareness or a history of hypoglycemia related accidents (like ohostatic hypotension) should probably not be treated with intensive insulin therapy\".

Please read the option carefully - It is diabetes mellitus with acute M. I. - Intensive diabetes management is definitely needed in patients with diabetes and acute M. I.

Complete clearance of all common duct stones is achieved endoscopically in 71% to 75% of patients at the first procedure and in 84% to 95% of patients after multiple endoscopic procedures. Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration through the cystic duct or with formal choledochotomy allows the stones to pass during the procedure. An open common bile duct exploration should be performed if endoscopic intervention is not available or not feasible because of anatomical restrictions or expeise. If choledochtomy is performed, a T tube is left in place. The purpose of the T tube is to provide access to the biliary system for postoperative radiologic stone extraction. With the increased use of endoscopic, percutaneous, and laparoscopic techniques, open bile common duct exploration is rarely performed today. Stone impacted in the ampulla may be difficult for both endoscopic ductal clearance and common bile duct exploration. In these cases, transduodenal sphincteroplasty and stone extraction should be performed; alternatively, if this is not successful, a choledochoduodenostomy or a Roux-en Y choledojejunostomy should be performed. The widespread use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and ERCP has decreased the incidence of complicated biliary tract disease and need for choledocholithotomy and T tube drainage of the bile ducts. EBS followed by spontaneous passage or stone extraction is the treatment of choice in the management of patients with common duct stones, especially in elderly or poor risk patients. Ursodeoxycholic acid It is one of the secondary bile acids, which are metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria. The drug reduces cholesterol absorption and is used to dissolve (cholesterol) gallstones in patients who want an alternative to surgery. It is the only FDA approved drug to treat primary biliary cirrhosis. Ref: Sabiston 18/e, Page 1560-61; Bailey & Love 25/e, Page 1126.",

H. pylori infection: decrease incidence of H. pylori due to improved hygine and effective drugs. 2. Refrigeration: Refrigerators improved storage of food, thereby reducing intake of salt-based preserved food (high in nitrites and carcinogenic nitrosamines). Refrigeration also allowed for fresh food and vegetables to be more readily available, which are a valuable source of antioxidants impoant for cancer prevention. Salt-preserved foods and dietary nitrite found in preserved food are potentially carcinogenic.

        "exp": "Ans. is (a) Indicated in 50-70yrs of age; (b) Moality reduced by 30%; (c) Radiation due to mammography can cause carcinoma Mammography is X-ray imaging of breasts to detect tumors or other abnormalities. it is of 2 types - i) Screening mammography is used to detect breast changes in women who have no signs or symptoms of any breast abnormality. The goal is to detect cancer before any clinical signs are noticeable. This usually requires at least 2 mammograms from different angles of each breast - a) the cranio-caudal (cc) view and b) the mediolateral-oblique (MLO) view. ii Diagnostic mammography is used to investigate suspicious breast changes such as a breast lump, breast pain, an unusual skin change, nipple discharge. It is also used to evaluate abnormal findings on a screening mammogram. Age for mammography Current guidelines from the U. S. Depament of Health and Human Services (HHS), the American Cancer Society (ACS), the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommend -screening mammography every year for women, beginning at age 40. The American Cancer Society recommends these screening guidelines Yearly mammograms are recommended staing at age 40 and continuing for as long as a woman is in good health Clinical breast exam (CBE) about every 3 years for women in their 20s and 30s and every year for women 40 and over Breast self-examination staing in their 20s.. The American Cancer Society recommends that those with high risk for breast cancer -- because of their family history, a genetic tendency, or ceain other factors -- be screened with MRI in addition to mammograms. But many societies are against screening mammography in women aged below 50 years. there is also controversy regarding the frequency of mammogram and utility of mammogram above 70 yrs of age. But one thing is ceain - its utility in 50-70 yrs age group, about which there is no controversy. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a 30% reduction in breast cancer moality in women 50-69 years who are screened annually or biennially with mammograms. The data on women under age 50 are less clear likewise data are sparse regarding efficacy of screening mammograms in women older than age 69\" - American College of Preventive Medicine CSDT 13/e writes- \"The beneficial effect of screening in women aged 50-69 years is undisputed and has been confirmed by all clinical trials. \" Radiation risk (Risk of carcinoma) no doubt that ionizing radiation (X rays) can itself cause breast cancer, but the dose used in mammography is so small (less than 0. 2 rads or 0. 2 c. Gy per exposure utilizing film-screen mammographic technique) that it is hardly of any significance. \"There has never been any direct evidence that the doses required for modern mammography have any effect on the breast paicularly among women over the age of 40 in whom screening is beneficial. There is no scientific evidence that any one ever has or ever will develop breast cnacer as the result of a mammogram. \" - Kopan's Breast imaging But still there is a theoretical risk of breast Ca (although very small) associated with mammography. About option 'd' & 'e' CSDT (13/e p285) writes? \"Mammography is the most reliable means of detecting breast cancer before a mass can be palpated. Slowly growing cancers can be identified by mammography at least 2 years before reaching a sized detectable by palpation. MRI and ultrasound may be useful screening modalities in women who are at high risk for breast cancer but not for the general population. The sensitivity of MRI is much higher than mammography; however, the specificity is significantly lower, which results in multiple unnecessary biopsies. The increased sensitivity despite decreased specificity may be considered a reasonable trade-off for those at increased risk for developing breast cancer but not for normal-risk population. \" But rememebr that generally mammography is not helpful in young women (< 35 years). This is because of dense breast. hi young women, ultrasound may be more useful than mammography. About ultrasound Bailey and Love (25/e p828) writes? \"Ultrasound is paicularly useful in young women with dense breasts in whom mammograms are difficult to interpret, and in distinguishing cysts from solid lesions. It can also be used to localize impalpable areas of breast pathology. It is not useful as screening tool and remains operator dependent. Increasingly, ultrasound of the axillary tissue is performed when a cancer is diagnosed and guided percutaneous biopsy of any suspicious glands may be performed. \" About MR Bailey and Love (25/e p829) writes? Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of increasing interest to breast surgeons in a number of settings: - It can be useful to distinguish scar from recurrence in women who have had previous breast conservation therapy for cancer (although it is not accurate within 9 months of radiotherapy because of abnormal enhancement). It is the best imaging modality for the breasts of women with implants. It has proven to be useful as a screening tool in a high-risk women (because offamily history). - It is less useful than ultrasound in the management of the axilla in both primary breast cancer and recurrent disease. Also remember - for maximum yield in screening programs, mammography is combined with physical examination since about 35-50% of early breast cancers can be discovered only by mammography and another 40% can be detected only by palpation. The two standard mammographic projections are: A mediolateral oblique (MLO) view and a craniocaudal (CC) view. The MLO is taken with the X-ray beam directed from superomedial to inferolateral, usually at an angle of 30-60deg. The MLO projection is the only projection in which all the breast tissue can be demonstrated on a single image. In CC view, the X-ray beam travels from superior to inferior. Positioning is achieved by pulling the breast up and forward away from the chest wall, with compression applied from above.",

The patient is taken to exploratory laparotomy, at which a small area of infarcted small bowel is found and surgically removed. Histologic studies on the removed section of bowel demonstrate a recent thrombus occluding a small muscular aery. The adjacent vessel wall shows fibrinoid necrosis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate containing neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the small bowel infarction?",
        "exp": "The lesion described is that of polyaeritis nodosa. This condition is often considered to be the prototype for the vasculitides, and characteristically affects small or medium-sized muscular aeries, with a predilection for the gastrointestinal tract and kidney (causing hematuria, albuminuria, or renal failure). Patients are typically young adult males, although both sexes and all ages may have the condition. Characteristically, vascular lesions of different stages may be present. Coicosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy has improved a formerly poor prognosis. Atherosclerosis can cause bowel infarction, but the histologic description would be that of a plaque.

Apprehension test: this is a provocative test in which the examiner cautiously lifts the arm into abduction, external rotation and then extension, at the crucial moment the patient senses that the humeral head is about to slip out anteriorly and his body toutens in apprehension. Relocation test: this test involves placing the shoulder in the position of apprehension and applying a posteriorly directed force on the humeral head. The result is considered positive if this relieves the patient's apprehension. Fulcrum test: with the patient supine. The clinician takes the shoulder into 90 degree abduction and adds lateral rotation and extension. The test indicate anterior instability if the patient becomes apprehensive.

The remainder occurs in the setting of MEN syndromes 2A or 2B or as familial tumors without an associated MEN syndrome. - The sporadic MTCs tend to originate in one lobe, whereas bilaterality and multicentricity is common in familial cases. The familial cases are also associated with C-cell hyperplasia, which is considered premalignant lesion of MTC. - Familial cases occur at a younger age, even childhood. Sporadic cases are seen in 6th decade. RET proto-oncogenes are known to play an impoant role in the development of both familial & sporadic MTCs. Patients with MTC often present with a neck mass that may be associated with palpable cervical lymphadenopathy (early spread to lymphatics is common) Diarrhoea is a feature in 30% of cases and this may be due to 5-hydroxytryptamine or prostaglandins produced by the tumour cells. (Ref B & L 25/e p797) Distal blood-borne metastasis to the liver, bone (frequently osteoblastic), and lung occur late in the disease. Diagnosis is established by FNAC - presence of amyloid stroma is diagnostic. raised serum calcitonin and CEA levels (Calcitonin is a more sensitive tumor marker, but CEA is a better predictor of prognosis) As it is not possible to distinguish sporadic from familial disease at initial presentation, all new patients with MTC should be screened for RET point mutations - pheochromocytoma (24 hr urinary levels of VMA, catecholamine & metanephrine) - hyperparathyroidism (serum calcium) (It is impoant to rule out a coexisting pheochromocytoma to avoid precipitating a hypeensive crisis & death during surgery) Also remember - MTC tumors don't take up radioiodine and are not hormone dependent.",

Below, I have quoted the text. Read it to make your own inference. \"The most common postoperative respiratory complication is atelectasis. As a result of the anesthetic, abdominal incision, and postoperative narcotics, the alveoli in the periphery collapse and a pulmonary shunt may occur. If appropriate attention is not directed to aggressive pulmonary toilet with the initial symptoms, the alveoli remain collapsed and a buildup of secretions occurs and becomes secondarily infected with bacteria. The risk appears to be paicularly high in patients who are heavy smokers, are obese, and have copious pulmonary secretions. Pneumonia may develop early (i. e., 2-5 days after admission to the hospital) or late (i. e., >5 days) and is referred to as health care-related pneumonia. Aspiration of oropharyngeal and gastric contents is the leading cause of health care-related pneumonia. Presentation and Management The most common cause of a postoperative fever in the first 48 hours after the procedure is atelectasis. The patients has a low-grade fever, malaise, and diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields. Very often the patient is uncomfoable from the fever but has no other ove pulmonary symptoms. Atelectasis is so common postoperatively that a formal workup is not usually required. However, if not aggressively managed, frank development of pneumonia is likely. A patient with pneumonia, on the other hand, will have a high fever, occasionally mental confusion, and the production of a thick secretion with coughing, leukocytosis, and a chest radiograph that reveals infiltrates. If the condition is not expeditiously diagnosed and treated, the patient may rapidly progress to respiratory failure and require intubation. Prevention of atelectasis and pneumonia is associated with pain control, which allows the patient to take deep breaths and cough. A patient-controlled analgesia device seems to be associated with better pulmonary toilet, as does the use of an epidural infusion catheter, paicularly in patients with epigastric incisions. Respiratory care, otherwise, begins preoperatively. The patient must be instructed in use of the incentive spirometer and be held accountable by nurses and physicians during rounds. Encouraging the patient to cough while applying counterpressure with a pillow on the abdominal incision site is most helpful. Rarely, other modalities such as intermittent positive pressure breathing and chest physiotherapy may be required. Encouraging the patient to breathe deeply and cough is the single most valuable management approach in preventing and resolving atelectasis and pneumonia. Patients in whom pneumonia develops in the postoperative period are managed with aggressive pulmonary toilet, induced sputum for culture and sensitivity testing, and empirical broad-spectrum IV antibiotic therapy while awaiting culture results. Once the organisms are cultured from sputum, a specific antibiotic must be used as indicated. \"",

        "question": "What is true about linkage analysis in familial gene disorders?",
        "exp": "Characteristic DNA polymorphism in a family is associated with disorders [Ref: Harrison 17/e p4031 We are not able to make sense of the options, but let's see what linkage analysis is all about. At least this could help somewhat... Prepare you for the correct options or other options in the exams. The human genome is very large and contains many thousands of genes. Therefore, finding the paicular gene or genes responsible for any given human disease is very difficult. Traditionally, the search for a disease gene begins with linkage analysis. In this approach, the aim is to find out the rough location of the gene relative to another DNA sequence called a genetic marker, which has its position already known. The principle of linkage analysis: Two fundamental principles are essential for understanding the concept of linkage. 1) When two genes or alleles are close together on a chromosome, they are usually transmitted together. Thus they are said to be linked. For example, in fruit flies the genes affecting eye color and wing length are inherited together because they appear on the same chromosome. Alleles for genes on different chromosomes are usually not linked, due to independent assoment of chromosomes during meiosis. 2). Because there is some crossing over of DNA when the chromosomes segregate, even linked alleles on the same chromosome can be separated and go to different daughter cells. There is a greater probability of this happening if the alleles are far apa on the chromosome, as it is more likely that a cross-over will occur between them. The odds of crossing over, or recombinant event, between two linked genes is propoional to the distance that separates them. Thus, genes that are far apa are more likely to undergo a recombination event than genes that are very close together. Thus by working out the number of recombinants it is possible to obtain a measure for the distance between the genes. This distance is called a genetic map unit (m. u.), or a centimorgan and is defined as the distance between genes for which one product of meiosis in 100 is recombinant. A linkage map is created by finding the map distances between numbers of traits that are present on the same chromosome, ideally avoiding having significant gaps between traits to avoid the inaccuracies that will occur due to the possibility of multiple recombination events. Linkage mapping is critical for identifying the location of genes that cause genetic diseases. A linkage map is a chromosome map of a species or experimental population that shows the position of its known genes and/or markers relative to each other in terms of recombination frequency, rather than as specific physical distance along each chromosome. Polymorphism is essential for linkage studies because they provide a means to distinguish the maternal and paternal chromosomes in an individual. All chromosomes are paired, one inherited from our mother and one from our father. Each pair of chromosomes contains the same genes in the same order, but the sequences are not identical. This means it should be easy to find out whether a paicular sequence comes from our mother or father. These sequence variants are called maternal and paternal alleles. Genetic markers are DNA sequences that show polymorphism (variations in size or sequence) in the population. They are present in everyone and they can be typed (the allele can be identified) using techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction. Disease genes are mapped by measuring recombination against the panel of different markers spread over the entire genome. In most cases, recombination will occur frequently, indicating that the disease gene and marker are far apa. Some markers however, due to their proximity, will tend not to recombine with the disease gene and these are said to be linked to it. Ideally, close markers are identified that flank the disease gene and define a candidate region of the genome between 1 and 5 million bp in length. The gene responsible for the disease lies somewhere in this region. Linkage is expressed as a lod (logarithm of odds score)- the ratio of the probability that the disease and marker loci linked rather than unlinked. By convention, a lod score greater than 3. 0 is considered evidence for linkage. (A score of +3. 0 means the likelihood of observing the given pedigree if the two loci are not linked is less than 1 in 1000). On the other hand, a lod score less than -2. 0 is considered evidence to exclude linkage. Markers that are closest to the disease gene are less likely to undergo recombination events and therefore receive a higher linkage score. Linkage analysis is possible only for familial diseases, wherein pedigree analysis of the disease is done in that family. All the family is screened for the presence of all known polymorphisms. Then the polymorphism that is present in all the affected cases is identified as the linked allele and based on the location of this polymorphism, the possible location of the disease gene can be identified.",

The remaining pancreas, biliary tree, and stomach are then reattached to the small intestine. The Whipple procedure is only performed in the relatively small percentage of patients who may have resectable disease. Tumors of the tail of the pancreas might, in theory, be more easily resected, but this area tends to not produce any signs or symptoms until late in the disease, after metastasis has occurred. Pancreatic cancers that are not resectable can be treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Immunotherapy using a vaccine based on the patient's own cancer cells is also being tried experimentally, and shows promise. An impoant thing to remember when treating these patients (and other poor prognosis patients) is that long-term survivors have occurred, and that even if death eventually intervenes, a survival of several years may be very much wohwhile to both the patient and his family (paicularly if young children are indirectly involved). The Billroth I and II procedures are used to treat gastric carcinomas and intractable peptic ulcers of the duodenum and stomach.

Vas deferens carries the sperms from epididymis to the urethra where they open by separate openings into the prostatic urethra. Just before opening each vas deferens is joined by ducts of seminal vesicles. Vas deferens and seminal vesicle ducts join to form the ejaculatory duct. The secretions of seminal vesicles form a large pa of seminal fluid and contain fructose and a coagulating enzyme called the vesiculase. Now coming to the question. Semen analysis forms an impoant pa of infeility assessment. Low ejaculatory volume is caused by retrograde ejaculation into the bladder or obstruction of the vas deferens or the ejaculatory duct Azoospermia may be seen in testicular failure or obstruction of vas deferens Absence of fructose suggests - seminal vesicles agenesis or obstruction. A semen that is low in volume with azoospermia and absence of fructose suggests -+ either obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts or congenital absence of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles. The anatomy of the vas deferens & seminal vesicles can be investigated by vasography (where contrast medium is injected into the vas deferens) or TRUS (Trans rectal ultrasonography), however TRUS is superior to vasography and is the investigation of choice.

A: Eversion The ankle is in equinus, and the foot is supinated (varus) and adducted (a normal infant foot usually can be dorsiflexed and eveed, so that the foot touches the anterior tibia). Forefoot cavus deformity is the result of excessive arching of the foot at the mid-tarsal joints. Dorsiflexion beyond 90deg is not possible. The navicular is displaced medially, as is the cuboid. Contractures of the medial plantar soft tissues are present. Not only is the calcaneus in a position of equinus but also the anterior aspect is rotated medially and the posterior aspect laterally. The heel is small and empty. The heel feels soft to the touch (akin to the feel of the cheeks). As the treatment progresses, it fills in and develops a firmer feel (akin to the feel of the nose or of the chin). The talar neck is easily palpable in the sinus tarsi as it is uncovered laterally. Normally, this is covered by the navicular, and the talar body is in the moise. The medial malleolus is difficult to palpate and is often in contact with the navicular. The normal navicular-malleolar interval is diminished. The hindfoot is supinated, but the foot is often in a position of pronation relative to the hindfoot. The first ray often drops to create a position of cavus. The Ponseti method of closed management of clubfeet through manipulations and casting describes the elevation of the first metatarsal as a first step, even if it means seemingly exacerbating the supination of the foot. Similar deformities are seen with myelomeningocele and ahrogryposis. Therefore, always examine for these associated conditions.",

Undescended testes fail in spermatogenic function, but may continue to secrete androgens. Spermatogenic failure is progressive; therefore, surgical exploration and scrotal placement of the testis should be performed before 2-years of age. If placement of the testicle into the scrotum is not possible, then orchiectomy is indicated because of the high risk of testicular cancer when the testis is left in an intraabdominal position.

A: Only breast These common surgical procedures for carcinoma breast include: Radical (Halsted) mastectomy is rarely used, and then only in cases where cancer cells have invaded the chest wall and the tumor is very large. The breast, pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles under the breast, and all of the lymph nodes are removed. This produces a large scar and severe disability to the arm nearest the removed breast. Modified radical (Patey) mastectomy is the most common form of mastectomy. It leaves the pectoralis major muscle intact. The breast and associated structures are removed en bloc and the excised mass is composed of: - The whole breast - A large poion of skin, the centre of which overlies the tumour but which always include the nipple - All of the fat, fascia and lymph nodes of the axilla - The pectoralis minor muscle is either divided or retracted to gain access to the upper two-thirds of the axilla. The axillary vein and the nerves to serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi (the thoraco-dorsal trunk) should be preserved. Simple, sometimes called total, mastectomy has been the treatment of choice in the late 1980s and 1990s. Generally, only the breast is removed; though, sometimes, one or two lymph nodes may be removed as well. Two other surgical procedures are variations on the simple mastectomy. The skin-sparing mastectomy is a new surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an incision, sometimes called a keyhole incision, around the areola. The tumor and all breast tissue are removed, but the incision is smaller and scarring is minimal. - The subcutaneous mastectomy, or nipple-sparing mastectomy, preserves the skin and the nipple over the breast. Paial mastectomy is used to remove the tumor, the lining over the chest muscle underneath the tumor, and a good poion of breast tissue, but not the entire breast. This is a good treatment choice for early stage cancers. Lumpectomy just removes the tumor and a small amount of tissue surrounding it. Some lymph nodes may be removed as well. This procedure is gaining acceptance among surgeons and patients alike.",

        "exp": "Dissecting aneurysms are usually the result of cystic medial necrosis of the aoa. This abnormality results from loss of elastic tissue in the media and is associated with hypertension and Marfan's syndrome. Most cases of dissecting aneurysms involve a transverse tear in the intima and are located in the ascending aoa, just above the aoic ring. The pain caused by a dissecting aneurysm is similar to the pain caused by a myocardial infarction, but it extends into the abdomen as the dissection progresses. Additionally, the blood pressure is not decreased with a dissecting aneurysm unless the aoa itself has ruptured. In contrast, berry aneurysms, found at the bifurcation of aeries in the circle of Willis, are due to congenital defects in the vascular wall. Rupture of these aneurysms may produce a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Berry aneurysms have been noted in about one-sixth of patients with adult polycystic renal disease and account for death in about 10% of patients with this type of polycystic renal disease. Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms occur in the thoracic aoa and may lead to luetic heart disease by producing insufficiency of the aoic valve. Mycotic (infectious) aneurysms result from microbial infection during septicemia, usually secondary to bacterial endocarditis. They are prone to rupture and hemorrhage. The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of eight syndromes characterized by defects in collagen synthesis. In EDS IV there is deficient synthesis of type III collagen and a tendency to rupture of muscular aeries, including dissecting aneurysms of the aoa.",

Trauma is usually severe associated with concussion and skull fracture. With aerial bleeding, the hematoma expands rapidly, and symptoms appear within hours after injury. The clinical course is acute? After a head injury often associated with a variable period of concussion - the patient appears normal for several hours (lucid interval). After this lucid interval, the pt. develops evidence of increased intracranial pressure with headache, vomitting, altered consciousness, and papilledema. Tentorial herniation rapidly follows, with occulomotor nerve palsy (pupillary inequality appears first, followed by failure of reaction to light k/a Hutchinson's sign and pyramidal tract compression. Compression of the brain stem follows, resulting in changes in heart rate, blood pressure and respiration. Coma and death rapidly ensue in untreated cases. Its an emergency and requires prompt diagnosis & surgical evacuation of the extradural blood collection. Chronic Subdural hematoma Accumalation of blood in the subdural space It occurs mainly in elderly patients with some degree of cerebral atrophy. The amount of trauma required is minimal. Bleeding is the result of rupture of communicating veins passing from the cerebral coex to the superior saggital sinus. Rupture occurs when there is movement of the brain relative to the fixed superior saggital sinus and is most likely when cerebral atrophy is present. Clinical course is slow (over days to month). - Pt. presents with slowly increasing intracranial pressure, causing headache, vomitting, papillcdema and fluctuating levels of consciousness. - Compression of the underlying brain may cause focal epileptic convulsions and neurological symptoms, most commonly contralateral spastic paralysis with prolonged but less severe compression, atrophy of the brain occurs and cause dementia.

Although medial joint space widening may be present on AP radiograph, a non centrically reduced ulno - humeal joint on lateral view is often the only radiographic finding.

Galactography/Ductography The primary indication for ductography is nipple discharge, particularly when bloody. Ductography though helpful in reaching a diagnosis is not essential since excision of the bloody duct system is indicated regardless of finding. In this study, a contrast medium is injected into the discharging duct and a mammogram taken. The injected may show an intraductal papilloma as a filling defect surrounded by contrast. Cancers may appear as irregular masses or as multiple intraluminal filling defects, or abrupt obstruction. Duct ectasia or fibrocystic disease may appear as dilated cystic structures Ultrasound - may show the presence of an underlying mass or duct ectasia.

Mechlorethamine, like cyclophosphamide (and carmustine and several others), is an alkylating agent. They are called bifunctional alkylating agents because they can covalently bind to DNA in two places (\"nucleophilic attack\"), thereby forming cross-links between two adjacent strands or between two bases in one strand. This ultimately disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis or may cause strand breakage. Cyclophosphamide (which can be considered the prototype of the alkylating agents) is actually a pro- drug--it requires metabolic activation in order for its effects to occur. Cyclophosphamide (and other alkylating agents) are cell cycle-nonspecific, although their efficacy is greater when cells are not in G0. Bleomycin, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin are good examples of drugs that intercalate in DNA strands. Thus, the altered DNA no longer serves as an adequately precise template for eventual synthesis of more functional DNA and RNA. They are classified as antitumor antibiotics. Etoposide and topotecan are examples of drugs that inhibit topoisomerase 11. The consequence is inhibited ability of affected cells to repair DNA strand breaks. This stops the cell cycle in G2 - The taxoid (e. g., paclitaxel) impairs mitosis, but by stabilizing assembled microtubules rather than by exeing a vinca alkaloid-like inhibition of microtubular assembly.",

The name is misnomer as there is no myositis (inflammation of muscle) and rarely ossification in the muscle (because the mineral phase differs from that in bone and no true bone matrix is formed). Etiology Injury (trauma) is an impoant factor and m. o. associated with trauma is better k/a post traumatic ossification it is seen in - Elbow > hipQ are commonly involved joints. - Trauma around elbowQ eg. fracture supracondylar humerus, dislocation or surgery. - Surgical trauma specially total hip replacement, - Massage to the elbow and vigorous passive stretchine to restore movements is aggravating factor. - Repeated micro trauma and overuse injuries. This type usually involve soleus muscle in ballerians. It occurs in muscles which are vulnerable to tear under heavy loads, such as quadriceps, adductors, brachicilisQ, biceps, and deltoid. M. 0. not associated with traumatic injury is termed as Pseudomalignant mysitis ossificans. And it is seen in Neurological disorders eg. G. B syndrome, AIDS encephalopathy, closed head injury, hypoxic brain injury & burns. Pathogenesis - Bone formation in muscle represents metaplasia of fibroblast at the site of injury. - Paial rupture & avulsion of muscle, ligament & joint capsule from bone usually cause periosteal elevation with the formation of subperiosteal hematoma and the wide exposure of cells with osteogenic potential. It inevitably lit subperiosteal ossification. - It has four microscopic zones (Ackerman Zonation) with centre most zone of undifferentiated, highly active (mitotic) cells and the outermost zone of well oriented hone encapsulated by fibrous tissue. - It must be distinguished from extaskeletal osteosarcoma. The latter usually occur in elderly, lacks zonationQ, and the most peripheral regions of osteosarcoma are most cellular & primitive, which is reverse of m. o. - It is distinguished from calcinosis, which is a metabolic disorder, often associated with collagen diseases - scleroderma & dermatomyositis. It is distinguished from ectopic calcification, which occurs in the capsule of joints, commonly the shoulder and is caused by inflammatory reaction around deposits of hydroxy - appetite crystals. And it is seen in CRF, hypo/hyper Clinical feature - Mostly asymptoma tic but may present with tenderness, palpable swelling, pain on range of motion, stiffness, and increased warmth. Imaging - Radiographs initially are normal, but by 10 days to 4 weeks fine calcification (dotted veil/ cotton wool appearance) is seen. - There is peripheral ossification and central lucencyQ of the mass. - The mass is usually seperated from underlying bone by at least a thin lineQ & lesion are usually located in the diaphysis. If the lesion is in continuity with the bone it is not myositis ossificans and the possibility of tumor or infection arises. - Calcification may first be noted on USG (focal hypoechoic mass located with in the muscle). - CT is better than x - ray - Biopsy before 4 weeks is usually in accurate. Treatment of Myositis Ossificans - Treatment is normally by 'watchful inactivity'. It must be emphasised that it is a passive stretching and not active exercise that is responsible for stimulating new growth formation. The worst treatment is to attack an injured and stiffish elbow with vigorous mucle stretching exercises; this is liable to precipitate or aggrevate the condition. So any physical therapy should be discontinuedQ. - Relative rest of the affected extremity is helpfulQ, with motion & activity gradually resumed as the acute phase subsides. In acute phase the treatment consist of limiting motion & icing the extremity while avoiding heat or massage - Low dose irradiation & indomethacin may prevent hetrotopic ossification, but the radiation should be avoided in children. - Surgical excision in toto is not done until a year or 2 after the acute phase of disease, at a time when radiograph reveal that the bone is fully mature and bone scan show either a return to normal uptake or decreasing activity in the lesion.",

        "question": "Which drug is not used to prevent contrastnephropathy a. EUR'",
        "exp": "Fenoldopam The administration of radiocontrast media can lead to a usually reversible form of acute kidney injury (formerly called acute renal failure) that begins soon after the contrast is administered. In most cases, there are no permanent sequelae, but there is some evidence that its development is associated with adverse outcomes. Prevention There is no specific treatment once contrast-induced acute renal failure develops, and management must be as, for any cause of acute tubular necrosis, with the focus on maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance. The best treatment of contrast-induced renal failure is prevention. A variety of preventive measures may reduce the risk of contras nephropathv. Types of radiocontrast agents Iodinated radiocontrast agents are either ionic or nonionic and, at the concentrations required for aeriography or computed tomography, are of variable osmolality: First generation agents are ionic monomers; they are highly hyperosmolal (approximately 1400 to 1800 mosmol/kg) compared with the osmolality of plasma. Second generation agents, such as iohexol, are nonionic monomers with a lower osmolality than the first generation radiocontrast media. - The newest nonionic contrast agents are isoosmolal. These isoosmolal agents have a lower osmolality than \"low osniolal\" second generation drugs. The iso-osnzolal nonionic contrast agent iodixanol appears to reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy in high-risk patients, such as diabetic patients with renal insufficiency, compared to the low osmolal nonionic agent iohexol, but not when compared to other low osnzolal nonionic agents. -However, additional randomized prospective trials comparing iodixanol (or other iso-osmolal agents if developed) to other low osmolal ionic or nonionic agents are required before it can be determined that isoosmolal contrast agents are uniformly less nephrotoxic than low osmolal agents as a class, especially given the substantially greater expense of the only currently available iso-osmolal nonionic agent, iodixanol. Hydration, mantilla, and diuretics Hydration is beneficial, and the type of hydration solution may be impoant. In comparison, the role of diuretics, mannitol and other renal vasodilators in this setting is unceain. Diuretics Several small trials have investigated the effect of diuretics. In one trial, 78 patients with stable chronic renal failure (mean plasma creatinine concentration 2. 1 ing/dL or >25 percent, measured 2 to 5 days after the procedure) occurred less frequently among patients who received iloprost compared to placebo (8 versus 22 percent respectively). - Severe hypotension required withdrawal of Iloprost in three patients. Although Iloprost may be effective in the prevention of contrast nephropathy, confirmation of these results in larger definitive trials is necessary before its use can be recommended. Fetzoldopanz - A prospective randomized trial (CONTRAST) assessed the effectiveness of fenoldopam in 315 patients (one-half diabetic) undergoing a cardiovascular procedure who had chronic renal. failure with an estimated creatinine clearance below 60 mllmin (mean 29 m1/min with a mean serum creatinine of 1. 8 mg/dL ). - All patients also received one-half normal saline as mentioned above, and contrast nephropathy was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of?.. 25 percent above baseline in the first four days. - There was no reduction in the incidence of contrast nephropathy in the fenoldopam group (34 versus 30 percent with placebo). It has been proposed that direct intrarenal administration may be more beneficial. Endothelia: receptor antagonist - A nonselective endothelin receptor antagonist was tested in a multicenter, double-blind randomized trial of high-risk patients undergoing coronary angiography. Compared with those assigned to placebo, a significantly higher percentage of patients who received active therapy sustained contrast nephropathy (56 versus 29 percent); this observation raises the possibility that endothelin may actually provide an intrinsic protective effect rather than contributing to the development of acute renal failure. Alternatively, selective endothelin receptor antagonists may be required to demonstrate prophylactic value in this setting. Summary And Recommendations Optimal therapy to prevent contrast-induced acute renal failure remains unceain. Patients with near-normal renal function are at little risk and, few precautions are necessary other than avoidance of volume depletion. We recommend the following preventive measures for patients at increased risk of contrast nephropathy, which is defined a serum creatinine 1. 5 mg/d1. (132 tnicromol/L) or an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/1. 73 m2, Use, if -possible, ultrasonography, MRI without gadolinium contrast, or CT scanning without radiocontrast agents. We recommend NOT using high osmolul agents. We recommend the use of iodixanol or nonionic low osmolal agents such as iopamidol or ioversol rather than iohexol. Use lower doses of contrast and avoid repetitive, closely spaced studies. Avoid volume depletion and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If there are no contraindications to volume expansion, we recommend isotonic intravenous fluids prior to and continued for several hours after contrast administration. The optimal type of fluid and timing of administration are not well established. We suggest isotonic bicarbonate rather than isotonic saline. Despite conflicting data, we suggest that acetylcysteine be administered the day before and the day of the procedure, based upon its potential. for benefit and low toxicity and cost. If acetylcysteine is administered, we suggest giving 1200 mg orally twice daily rather than 600 mg twice daily the day before and the day of the procedure. Based upon the lack of convincing evidence of benefit and the potential risk of anaphylactoid reactions, we suggest not using intravenous acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast nephropathy. (Note: Oral acetylcysteine is used.) We recommend NOT using mannitol or other diuretics prophylactically. Among patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD, we recommend NOT performing prophylactic hemofiltration or hemodialysis after contrast exposure. Among patients with stage 5 CKD, we suggest prophylactic hemodialysis after contrast exposure if there is already a. functioning hemodialysis access.",

Inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. Male to female ratio is 2-3: 1 Strong correlation with HLA-B270-95% of case 9s are positive for HLA - B27. Joints involved in ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis primarily affects axial skeleton. The disease usually begins in the sacro-iliac joints and usually extends upwards to involve the lumbar, thoracic, and often cervical spine. In the worst cases the hips or shoulders are also affected. Hip joint is the most commonly affected peripheral joint. Rarely knee (Ebenzar 4th/e 593) and ankle (Apley's 9thle 67) are also involved. Pathology Enthesitis i. e. inflammation of the inseion points of tendons, ligaments or joint capsule on bone is one of the hallmarks of this entity of disease. Primarily affects axial (spinal) skeleton and sacroiliitis is often the earliest manifestation of A. S.. Involvement of costoveebral joints frequently occur, leading to diminished chest expansion (normal _ 5 cm) Peripheral joints e. g. shoulders, and hips are also involved in 1/3rd patients. Extraaicular manifestations like acute anterior uveitis (in 5%); rarely aoic valve disease, carditis and pulmonary fibrosis also occur. Pathological changes proceed in three stages? Inflammation with granulation tissue formation and erosion of adjacent bone. Fibrosis of granulation tissue Ossification of the fibrous tissue, leading to ankylosis of the joint. Radiological features of ankylosing spondylitis Radiographic evidence of sacroiliac joint is the most consistent finding in ankylosing spondylitis and is crucial for diagnosis. The findings are:- Sclerosis of the aiculating surfaces of SI joints Widening of the sacroiliac joint space Bony ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints Calcification of the sacroiliac ligament and sacro-tuberous ligaments Evidence of enthesopathy - calcification at the attachment of the muscles, tendons and ligaments, paicularly around the pelvis and around the heel. X-ray of lumbar spine may show:- Squaring of veebrae: The normal anterior concavity of the veebral body is lost because of calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament. ft Loss of the lumbar lordosis.

        "exp": "Pentoxyfylline Therapies for Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis and/or Alcoholic Cirrhosis Coicosteroids The rationale underlying the use of coicosteroids in acute alcoholic hepatitis is to ameliorate the characteristic inflammatory response which accompanies this disorder. These agents have well-known effects on the immune response, and reduce cytokine production, suppress the formation of acetaldehyde adducts and inhibit the production of collagen. Coico. ste raids have been studied in several randomized double-blind trials, and have been subject to a number of meta-analyses. Despite this intense interest, neither the source studies nor the meta-analyses have reached a consensus conclusion regarding the efficacy of coicosteroids in the treatment of acute alcoholic hepatitis. The most recent study of Mathurin et al. re-analysed the original data from three randomized trials that included patients with severe illness (102 patients were treated with placebo and 113 were treated with steroids). The 28-day survival was higher in the coicosteroid group, so that, for every five patients treated, one death was avoided. This benefit was consistent during the first year of treatment, but disappeared at 2 years of follow-up. Despite the apparent benefit of coicosteroids in severe illness, many clinicians remain sceptical about their use. One explanation for this phenomenon is that many potential candidates for coicosteroid therapy have one or more contraindications to treatment, such as coincidental bacterial infections, gastrointestinal bleeding or renal failure. An additional reason may be the conflicting data. from trials, including meta-analyses, which have failed to demonstrate a benefit of coicosteroids. Oxpentifylline (Pentoxifylline) Oxpentifylline (pentoxifylline) is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of intermittent claudication. - In addition to improving the responses of red blood cells to defonning stress, oxpentifylline (pentoxifylline) inhibits the output of TNF-a by modulating the transcription of the TNF-a gene. Recently, Akridis et al. repoed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of oxpentifylline (pentoxifylline) involving 101 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. - Hepatorenal syndrome was the cause of death in six of 12 cases (50%) in the treated group and 22 of 24 cases (91. 7%) in tire placebo group. Thus, the benefit of oxpentifylline (pentoxifylline) in treating acute alcoholic hepatitis appears to be related to a significant decrease in the risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome. - Although these data provide evidence of a dramatic benefit, they await the validation of independent randomized controlled clinical trials. Anti-TNF Therapy Acute alcoholic hepatitis is a potentially impoant indication for the use of direct anti-TNF-a agents, although the liming of their administration in relation to the last use of alcohol and the provision of appropriate prophylaxis against infection may be critical practical issues. - Up to now, only two human studies utilizing direct anti-TNF therapy in acute alcoholic hepatitis have been repoed. In one, the monoclonal antibody anti-TNF-a (infliximab) was compared with placebo in patients with alcoholic hepatitis receiving coicosteroids. - Although the histology did not improve, the 28-day Maddrey score Unproved significantly in the group receiving anti-TNF. Unfounately, moality data were not repoed and, in their absence, the interpretation of the Maddrey score as a surrogate end-point is questionable. In another recent study, open-label uncontrolled use of infliximab was described in 12 patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The authors repoed that more than 80% of patients survived for 15 months from the initiation of therapy. Although TNFa messenger RNA expression in the liver did not change, the expression of IL-8, a cytokine regulated mainly by TNF-a, was almost absent on day 28. 1 Both studies provide suppo for randomized controlled trials of -04 appropriate power to determine whether anti-TNF-a treatment is efficacious in acute alcoholic hepatitis. Despite the evidence that alcoholic liver disease is associated with enhanced oxidative stress, this research has not been translated into clinical therapy. Studies published in abstract form have failed to show that different kinds of antioxidants (when compared with coicosteroids or placebo) confer any benefit in the treatment of acute alcoholic hepatitis. Turning to the use of antioxidants in the setting of cirrhosis, there have been several trials using silymarin (milk thistle) as antioxidant. In a double-blind, prospective, randomized clinical trial involving 170 patients with cirrhosis (91 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis), 87 patients were treated with 140 mg silymarin three times daily and 83 patients received placebo. The mean observation period was 41 months. Fifty of 87 (58%) silymarin-treated patients, as opposed to 32 of 83 (39%) placebo-treated patients, survived for 4 years or longer. This difference, which was significant at the P Another goal of antioxidant therapy involves the enhancement of the cell's own antioxidant capacity, which is the rationale for external supplementation of S-adenosyl methionine. A randomized, double-blind trial of S-adenosyl methionine or placebo was perfonned in 123 alcoholic cirrhotic patients. The overall moality/liver transplantation at the end of the trial decreased, from 30% in the placebo group to 16% in the treated group, although this difference was not statistically significant. In summary, there remains a lack of compelling evidence that antioxidants, such as silymarin, or membrane stabilizers, such as S-adenosyl methionine, exe a substantial salutary effect in patients with cirrhosis due to alcohol-mediated liver injury. Propylthiouracil The rationale underlying the use of propylthiouracil in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease rests on the observation that the most severe alcohol-induced damage is often in the perivenular area (zone 3), thereby resembling ischaemic injury. The putative mechanism of propylthiouracil to produce a benefit in this setting is by reducing hepatic oxygen consumption by hepatocytes. An initial trial by Halle et al. found no benefit of propylthiouracil in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Some years later, Orrego et al. observed, in a larger coho, that the administration of propylthiouracil reduced the moality due to alcoholic liver disease. This randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was remarkable Pr the care taken to monitor alcohol consumption by the study paicipants and thereby control for the greatest confounding factor complicating the interpretation of investigations of treatment for alcoholic liver disease. Despite such admirable study design and the demonstration of a statistically impressive benefit in propylthiouracil recipients compared with controls, propylthiouracil has not gained currency as a treatment for alcoholic liver disease. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis, including data from 710 patients with several forms of alcoholic liver disease, could not demonstrate any benefit of propylthiouracil on moality, liver-related moality, liver complications or liver histology. Colchicine Colchicine is an inhibitor of collagen synthesis. Unfounately, results regarding the use of colchicine in the treatment of liver cirrhosis are conflicting. The most potent data in suppo of its use come from the study by Kershenobich et al. In their study of colchicine for the treatment of all forms of cirrhosis, the 5-year survival rate was 74% in the colchicine-treated group compared with 34% in the placebo group. The 10-year survival rate was twice as great for the colchicinetreated group. This study was confounded by the high dropout rate. Fuhermore, a recent meta-analysis conducted by Rambaldi and Gluud, combining the results of 14 randomized clinical trials involving 1150 patients, demonstrated no significant beneficial effects of colchicine on moality, liver-related moality. complications of liver failure, liver biochemistry, liver histology or alcohol consumption. Conversely, colchicine was associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse events. Phosphatidylcholine Encouraging results have been obtained with some 'super' nutrients in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease. Phosphatidylcholine, purified from polyunsaturated lecithin, was discovered to oppose ethanol-induced fibrosis by decreasing the activation of stellate cells to transitional cells, and possibly also by stimulating collagenase activity. Recent evidence has suggested that phosphatidylcholine may have an effect on alcohol-induced liver damage by decreasing the activities of cytochrome P450 2. E1, an oxidative enzyme implicated in alcohol metabolism, and by modulating TNF-a. Recently, a randomized, prospective, double-blind, clinical trial comparing phosphatidylcholine with placebo was conducted in 789 male alcoholics at 20 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. All subjects demonstrated hepatic fibrosis that did not meet the criteria for cirrhosis on liver biopsy prior to the initiation of the study. Treatment was maintained for 2 years. No histological benefit was observed in the treated group compared with the placebo group",

EGFR mutations Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in many types of cancers, especially colorectal cancer (CRC), and seems to reflect more aggressive histological and clinical behaviours. It was observed that EGFR was significantly associated with TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) stage T3. In the context of a new therapeutic strategy using EGFT-targeted therapies (e. g. cetuximab), although EGFR remains a controversial prognostic factor, this expression-stage association may play a crucial role in a decision to initiate an adjuvant treatment. \"- Deng Y, Jurland B, Wang. 1, Bi. 1, Li W, Rao S, Lan P, Lin T and Lin E. High epidermal growth factor receptor expression in metastatic colorectal cancer lymph nodes may be more prognostic of poor survival than in primary tumor. Am J Clin Oncol. 2009; 32:(3): 245-52. High EGFR expressions in metastatic lymph nodes seem to be more accurate in predicting survival than in primary or metastatic tissues. Microsatellite Instability: (Robbil, ) The microsatellite instability pathway is characterized by genetic lesions in mismatched repair genes. It is involved in 10 to 15% of sporadic cases of colon cancer and in the hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome. Mutations in the mismatch repair genes cause alternation of microsatellites, leading to microsatellite instability. These satellites are prone to misalignment during DNA replication. Most microsatellite sequences are in the non-coding regions of the genes, and hence, mutations in these genes are probably harmless. However, some microsatellite sequences are located in the coding or promotor regions of genes involved in regulation of cell growth. Loss of mismatch repair genes leads to accumulation of these and other growth-regulating genes, culminating in the emergence of colorectal carcinoma. C-MYC Mutations: In human colorectal adenocarcinomas, overexpression of the c-myc m. RNA has been repoed to occur in 60-80% of cases. C-myc has been characterized as a proto-oncogene, which promotes cell proliferation. However, overexpression of the c-myc m. RNA is associated with a more ourable prognosis. k-RAS mutations: The k-RAS is the most frequently observed activated oncogene in adenomas and colon cancers. k-RAS plays a role in intracellular signal transduction and is mutated in fewer than 10% of adenomas less than 1 cm in size, in about 50% of adenomas larger than I cam and in approximately 50% of carcinomas.",

As it enlarges, it frequently ulcerates centrally, leaving a raised, pearly border with telangiectases, which aids in making the diagnosis. Most tumors are observed on the face, although the trunk and extremities also are affected Cystic basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant of nodular basal cell carcinoma, cystic basal cell carcinoma is often indistinguishable from nodular basal cell carcinoma clinically, although it might have a polypoid appearance Pigmented basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant of nodular basal cell carcinoma that has brown-black macules in some or all areas, often making it difficult to differentiate from melanoma. Morpheaform (sclerosing) basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant in which tumor cells induce a proliferation of fibroblasts within the dermis and an increased collagen deposition (sclerosis) that clinically resembles a scar. Superficial basal cell carcinoma is often multiple, most often developing on the upper trunk or shoulders",

        "exp": "Abdomen-Neck [Ref In transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) the thorax dosen't needs to be opened. Esophagus is removed through the diaphragmatic hiatus by making incisions in the abdomen and the neck. In this operation, first an upper abdominal incision is made. The surgeon mobilizes the esophagus by working upward through the diaphragmatic hiatus. With the addition of an incision on the left side of the neck, the surgeon completes the mobilization of the esophagus, removes it, and moves the stomach upward through the hiatus and into the chest until its upper end appears in the neck wound. The remaining esophagus is connected to the stomach in the neck (cervical esophagogastric anastomosis). Advantages of Transhiatal esophagectomy over transthoracic esophagectomy: The two leading causes of morbidity and moality in the first few days after a transthoracic esophagectomy are 1) Lung complications (especially pneumonia) associated with a large operation that requires opening both the chest and the abdomen. The pain of these combined incisions may make it difficult for the patient to take a deep breath early after the operation, and this allows pneumonia to set in; and 2) Severe infection in the chest (mediastinitis) resulting due to a \"leak\" from intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis. After a TIC, because the patient has not had the chest opened, there is less pain early after surgery, the patient can move about better as a result, and lung complications are less. Fuhermore, if an anastomotic leak occurs, it can be easily managed by a simple cervical drainage as the anastomosis here is placed in the neck.",

In addition to regaining length, and axial alignment (by reducing angulation), achieving normal rotational alignment is necessary if a good, range of pronation and supination is to be restored.

Leukocytosis may suggest infection of the cyst. Eosinophilia is present in 25% of all persons who are infected, while hypogammaglobinemia is present in 30%. Almost every serodiagnostic technique has been evaluated for echinococcosis, with variable results. - The indirect hemagglutination test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have a sensitivity of 80% overall (90% in hepatic echinococcosis, 40% in pulmonary echinococcosis) and are the initial screening tests of choice. - Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis demonstrate antibodies to antigen 5 and provide specific confirmation of reactivity. - The ELISA test is useful in follow-up to detect recurrence. Imaging Studies - Plain films Findings from plain films of the chest, abdomen, or any other involved site are, at best, nonspecific and mostly nonrevealing. A thin rim of calcification delineating a cyst is suggestive of an echinococcal cyst. - Ultrasound Ultrasonography helps in the diagnosis of hydatid cysts when the daughter cysts and hydatid sand are demonstrated. The accuracy of ultrasound evaluations remains operator-dependent. CT scan CT scan has an accuracy of 98% and the sensitivity to demonstrate the daughter cysts. It is the best test for the differentiation of hydatid from amebic and pyogenic cysts in the liver. - MRI: Images show the cysts adequately, but MRI offers no real advantage over CT scan. Other Tests - Casoni test Historically, an intradermal skin test (Casoni test) was used and had a sensitivity of 70%. It is now largely abandoned because of its low sensitivity, low accuracy, and potential for severe local allergic reaction.",

Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the median nerve is compressed in the carpal tunnel below flexor retinaculum. The carpal tunnel is a narrow rigid passage way of ligament and bones at the base of hand, in front of distal pa of wrist. Carpal tunnel houses the median nerve and 9 tendons (4 FDS, 4 FDP & FPL). Causes of carpal tunnel syndrome There are many causes of carpal tunnel syndrome: 1) Idiopathic: - This is the most common cause. 2) Pregnancy and menopause 3) Metabolic: - Gout, Diabetes mellitus 4) Endocrine: - Hypothyroidism, Myxedema, Acromegaly, Hyperparathyroidism. 5) Deposition disorder Amyloidosis, Sarcoidosis, Rheumatid ahritis, Leukemia, CRF, Mucopoly saccharoidosis. 6) Alcoholism 7) Local causes: - Malunited colle's fracture, osteo-ahritis of the carpal bones, synovitits of flexor tendon sheath, hematoma. Clinical features of carpal tunnel syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome is more common in women and occurs between 35-50 years. Symptoms usually sta gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, paresthesia and numbness in the distribution of median nerve, i. e., lateral three & half of fingers and lateral 2/3rd of palm. The symptoms often first appear during night, since many people sleep with flexed wrists. (Flexion decreases the space in carpal tunnel which results in increased pressure over median nerve). Sensory symptoms can often be reproduced by percussing over median nerve (Tinel's sign) or by holding the wrist fully flexed for a minute (Phalen's test). As the disease progresses, clumsiness of hand and impairment of digital function develop. Later in the disease, there is sensory loss in median nerve distribution and obvious wasting of thenar eminence. Clinical Tests for Carpal tunnel syndrome There are some provocative tests which act as impoant screening methods:? 1) Wrist flexion (Phalen's test): - The patient is asked to actively place the wrist in complete flexion. If tingling and numbness develop in the distribution of median nerve, the test is positive. This is the most sensitive provocative test. 2) Tourniquet test: - A pneumatic BP cuff is applied proximal to the elbow and inflated higher than the patient's systolic BP. The test is positive if there is paresthesia or numbness in the region of median nerve distribution in hand. 3) Median nerve percussion test (Tinel's sign): - The median nerve is gently tapped at the wrist. The test is positive if there is tingling sensation. 4) Median nerve compression test: - Direct pressure is exeed equally over both wrists by the examiner. If symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome appear, the test is positive.",

Older age groups are most often affected, and coexisting gallstones are present in the vast majority of cases. The symptoms at presentation are vague and are most often related to adjacent organ invasion. Imaging studies may reveal a mass replacing the normal gallbladder, diffuse or focal thickening of the gallbladder wall, or a polypoid mass within the gallbladder lumen. Adjacent organ invasion, most commonly involving the liver, is typically present at diagnosis, as is biliary obstruction. Peripoal and peripancreatic lymphadenopathy, hematogenous metastases, and peritoneal metastases may also be seen. The vast majority of gallbladder carcinomas are adenocarcinomas. Because most patients present with advanced disease, the prognosis is poor. The radiologic differential diagnosis includes the more frequently encountered inflammatory conditions of the gallbladder, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, adenomyomatosis, other hepatobiliary malignancies, and metastatic disease. The prevalence of lymphatic spread is high in gallbladder carcinoma. Lymphatic metastases progress from the gallbladder fossa through the hepatoduodenal ligament to nodal stations near the head of the pancreas. Three pathways of lymphatic drainage have been suggested: the cholecystoretropancreatic pathway, the cholecystoceliac pathway, and the cholecystomesenteric pathway. The cystic and pericholedochal lymph nodes are the most commonly involved at surgery and are a critical pathway to involvement of the celiac, superior mesenteric, and para-aoic lymph nodes.",

Genu valgum is a condition in which the knees touch, but the ankles do not touch. Normally, a child is born with genu varum. Therefore, neonates and infants normally have genu varum. When the infant begins to stand and walk, the lower limb straighten and this physiological genu varus disappear at around years of age. The leg become straight. Then, between the age of 2-3 years genu valgum stas developing gradually with maximum genu - valgum of 12deg at the age of 31/4 years. Finally genu-valgum spontaneously get corrected by the age of 7 years to that of normal adult genu valgum of 7 - 8deg. So upto 7 years, exagerated genu valgum is physiological. If this exaggerated genu valgum persists after 8 years, then it is pathological genu valgum.",

It causes a chronic low-level inflammation of the stomach lining and is strongly linked to the development of duodenal and gastric ulcers and stomach cancer. Over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic.

The highest incidence reported for cleft lip and palate occurs in the Indian tribes of Montana, USA (1: 276). Although cleft lip and palate is an extremely diverse and variable congenital abnormality, several distinct subgroups exist, namely cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P), cleft palate (CP) alone and submucous cleft palate (SMCP). The typical distribution of cleft types is: Cleft lip alone: 15%; Cleft lip and palate: 45%; Isolated cleft palate: 40%. Cleft lip/palate predominates in males, whereas cleft palate alone appears to be more common in females. In unilateral cleft lip the deformity affects the left side in 60% of cases.

Blood tests initially will reveal hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to loss of hydrochloric acid vomiting, but sodium and potassium levels are normal.

Initially the urine has low chloride and high bicarbonate content, reflecting primary metabolic abnormality. This bicarbonate is excreted along with sodium and so, with time patient becomes progressively hyponatremic and more profoundly dehydrated. Because of dehydration, a phase of sodium retention follows and potassium and hydrogen are excreted in preference. This results in urine becoming paradoxically acidic and hypokalemia ensues.",

M: F ratio is 4: I Diagnosis: Barium enema: The initial diagnostic step in a newborn with radiographic evidence of a distal bowel obstruction is a barium enema. In a normal barium enema study, the rectum is wider than the sigmoid colon. In patients with Hirschsprung's disease, this relationship is reversed. Rectal biopsy? - Diagnosis can be confirmed by full thickness rectal biopsy. Rectal biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease. The histopathologic features of Hirschsprung's disease are: Absent ganglia, hyperophied nerve trunks, and increased acetylcholinesterase staining Anorectal manometry? - is a useful screening test in constipated young child or adult who is otherwise fit. Treatment of choice - ' is pull-through procedure in which normally innervated colon is anastomosed to the distal rectum just above the internal sphincter, thus bypassing the contracted aganglionic segment and restoring normal defecation. Option a Most of the cases are sporadic, Familial cases also occur but their inheritance pattern is not clear.",

(a) Endothelial injury (or vascular injury) (b) Stasis or turbulence of blood flow (c) Blood hypercoagulability Virchow's triad should be the cornerstone for assessment of risk factors for deep venous thrombosis. Stasis can occur with venous insufficiency, severe heart failure, or prolonged bed rest or immobility of an extremity following coma, pelvic or limb fracture, paralysis, extended airplane travel, or a lengthy operation. Endothelial injury can result from direct trauma (severed vein, venous cannulation, or transvenous pacing) or local irritation secondary to infusion of chemotherapy, previous DVT, or phlebitis. - Damaged endothelium leads to platelet aggregation, degranulation and formation of thrombosis as well as vasoconstriction ad activation of the coagulation cascade. Hypercoagulable state can be inherited or acquired. These are - def of antithrombin III, protein C or S - increased homocysteine - factor V Leiden mutation - prothrombin gene mutation - antiphospholipid syndrome - paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria - malignancy (lung cancer - most commonly pancreas, prostate, breast, ovary etc...) - nephrotic syndrome - pregnancy, high dose estrogen therapy or OCPs.

Fat originates from the site of trauma, paicularly from the injured marrow of the fractures bone and the suggestion that the fat arises from the plasma as a result of agglutination of chylomicrons is not suppoed by the vivo experiments. Circulating fat globules >10 mm in diameters occurs in most adults after close fracture of long bones and histological traces of fat can be found in the lungs and other internal organs. Few of these patients develop clinical features similar to ARDS and are known as fat embolic syndrome. Clinical presentation: The patient is usually a young adult with a lower limb fracture (especially of femur), more commonly after closed fracture of long bone (especially of femur) and more so when fractures are multiple. It usually manifests itself within 24-48 hrs, but occasionally the onset may be delayed for several days. Early warning signs (within 72 hrs of injury) are a slight rise in temperature (pyrexia) and pulse rate (tachycardia). In more pronounced cases there is breathlessness, mild restlessness, petechiae on the chest, axillae, retina and conjunctival folds, progressing to marked respiratory distress and coma in severe cases. Management: Prevention: Rough handling, inadequate immobilization and long journey to reach trauma centre are predisposing factors that must be avoided in long bone fractures. Fracture stabilization by IM nail. Stopping the emboli from reaching main circulation by tieing profunda vein (this is of doubtful value) Removing fat emboli from circulation by lipolytic agents as heparin 9 serum lipase activity) Hypeonic glucose (decrease FFA production) Offset its effect by: Vasodilation e. g. phenoxybenzamine Prompt correction of hypovolemia Prophylactic use of O2 Dextran (expand plasma volume, reduce RBC aggregation and platelet adherence) Aprotinin (protease inhibitor) decrease platelet aggregation and serotonin release. Alcohol has vasodilator and lipolytic effect Treatment of established case: Aim of treatment is maintaining adequate O2 level in the ventilation. Oxygen is the only therapeutic tool of proven use. It should be administered in sufficient amount to maintain aerial PO2 > 80 mmhg. O2 toxicity (pneumonia) is avoided by using O2 conc. below 40% Steroids are given to avoid chemical pneumonia resulting from breakdown of pneumonia fat emboli in to FFA.

CO2) can be ignored because negligible amounts are present at physiologic pH, leaving the equilibrium: CO2 + H2O H+ + HCO3- The leftward shift to replenish exhaled CO2 decreases the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration and increases the pH (- log10) to produce alkalosis (blood pH above the physiologic norm of 7. 4).

This type of ureterocele is also termed ohotopic, since it arises from a ureter with a normal inseion into the trigone. An intravesical ureterocele results from the prolapse of the mucosa of the terminal segment of the ureter through the ureterovesical orifice into the bladder. This prolapsed ureteral mucosa carries with it a poion of the continuous sheet of the bladder mucosa around the orifice. The prolapsed segment thus has a wall that consists of a thin layer of muscle and collagen interposed between the bladder uroepithelium and the ureter uroepithelium. Since the terminal ureteral orifice is usually narrowed and paially obstructed, and since there is no muscle suppo for the double mucosal walls of the prolapsed segment, it dilates. This dilated segment fills with urine and protrudes into the bladder. On excretory urography, cobra head sign is classically seen with an intravesical ureterocele.",

        "question": "A day after a left-sided lumpectomy and axillary dissection, a 63-year-old woman is experiencing difficulty elevating her left arm. She cannot fully raise her upper arm from the side of her body. The median border and inferior angle of the left scapula become unusually prominent when she pushes against the wall with both hands. The innervation of which of the following muscles was most likely injured during the surgery?",
        "exp": "This patient most likely sustained an injury to the long thoracic nerve (C5-C7), which innervates the serratus anterior muscle. This muscle is located on the lateral poion of the thorax, attaching to the external surface of the lateral pas of the 1st - 8th ribs proximally and the anterior surface of the medial border of the scapula distally. It is responsible for keeping the scapula applied to the thoracic wall, and protracts and rotates the scapula. Other muscles and bones rely on the scapula to be \"fixed\", as they use it as an anchor when producing movements of the humerus. Injury to the long thoracic nerve, which lies on the medial wall of the axilla, can occur during weight lifting, thoracic or axillary surgery, or from a stab wound. The clinical features of a long thoracic nerve injury include a \"winged\" scapula (the protrusion of the scapula as the patient presses against a wall) and an inability to abduct the arm. The deltoid and teres minor muscles are innervated by the axillary nerve (C5-C6), which winds around the humeral neck, and may be injured during the dislocation of the shoulder or a fracture to the neck of the humerus. Injuries to this nerve present with weakness of shoulder abduction, and atrophy of the shoulder. \"Winging\" of the scapula is not a prominent clinical feature of an axillary nerve injury. The latissimus dorsi muscle is innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve (C6-C8), and is a large, fan-shaped muscle that extends, adducts, and medially rotates the humerus, and helps raise the body toward the arms during climbing and performing chin-ups. Injury to the nerve that innervates this muscle can occur during surgical operations in the axilla, and makes the patient unable to perform a chin-up or go climbing. The patient's clinical findings in this case are inconsistent with an injury to the thoracodorsal nerve. The pectoralis major muscle, which is innervated by the medial and lateral pectoral nerves, is involved in the adduction and medial rotation of the arm. Injury to the nerves that innervate this muscle does not typically result in any disability, however the anterior axillary fold is absent on the affected side.",

They normally relax with initiation of a swallow and then return to a state of tonic contraction. Sling fibres of the cardia Crura of the diaphragm Intraabdominal pressure - the intraabdominal pressure compresses the intraabdominal segment of esophagus (ie LES) and is probably the most important factor in preventing the reflux. - CSDT writes - \"Sphincter competance is a function of sphincter pressure, sphincter length and the length exposed to intraabdominal pressure\". - In cases of sliding hernia the gastroesophageal junction shifts to posterior mediastinum. The LES is then exposed to the low intrathoracic pressure instead of the high intraabdominal pressure. The low intrathoracic pressure is unable to prevent the reflux in sliding hernia. Other factors apart from LES which prevent the reflux The gastroesophageal angle - the oblique entry of esophagus has a valvular effect, in that it closes the esophagus when the gastric fundus distends The folds of mucosa at the cardia helps in closing the LES when intragastric pressure rises.

        "exp": "PSVT [Ref: Harrison 17/e p. 1431, 1427, 1426, 14351 Sinus tachycardia Sinus tachycardia occurs when SA node discharges at a rate faster than 100 beats/minute. Sinus tachycardia represents a normal or appropriate response to a physiological stress such as that occurs with exercise, anxiety or fever. It is impoant to distinguish sinus tachycardia from other SVT's. - Sinus tachycardia will produce a Pwave contour consistent with its origin from the sinus node. - Sinus tachycardia is in absence of complicating conduction disturbance is characterized by normal P-QRS-T complexes which are recorded in rapid succession. Onset of sinus tachycardia is gradual. - Sinus tachycardia is the normal physiological response to exercise and emotions. A sinus tachycardia that persists at rest is usually an expression of some underlying disorder. Atrial flutter In atrial flutter the impulse originates. from a single. focus in the atria. Classical or typical atrial flutter has an atrial rate of about 300 heats/minute. The ventricular response to this rapid atrial activity depends upon the efficacy of A-V conduction. - Occasionally every atrial impulse is conducted to the ventricle i. e., a 1: 1 response resulting in very. fast ventricular rate. - More commonly second degree A-V block is present resulting in a relatively slow ventricular rate. The Atrial flutter commonly present in with a ventricular response that tends to be 2: 1 or typically 130-150 beats/minute. - This means that every second atrial beat gets through the A-V node. - Because the ration of P to QRS is usually consistent atrial flutter is often regular. So atrial flutter commonly present as fixed 2: 1 A-V block with a regular heart rate that is 150-200 b/rm These are spontaneously occurring and sporadic paroxysmal episodes of regular rapid heart rate of 150-250 beats/minute. Theoretically it refers to any tachycardia that is not ventricular in origin. In the widest sense SVT may include abnormal sinus tachycardia, ectopic atrial tachycardia (that is not from sinoatrial node), Atrial. fibrillation1flutter and junctional tachycardial. Often, however, in clinical setting, it is used practically as a synonym for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Supraventricular tachycardia develops and ends abruptly and during the episode the heart rate is b/w 150-250 and is regular. - Symptoms in PSVT may sta and stop suddenly often in response to quick movement such as picking up something from the floor. Because physiological sinus tachycardia has a gradual onset and atrial fibrillation is irregular they are excluded from the PSVT category. PSVT are most commonly AV nodal reentrant tachycardia or pa of WPW syndrome. Idioventricular rhvthum In idioventricular tachycardia an ectopic, focus in the ventricle is enhanced and it exceeds or equals the sinus rate. The heart rate in idioventricular rhythm is in the rage of 70- 80b/minute. Sinus tachycardia can be ruled out as it has slow onset. In idioventricular tachycardia the heart rate is usually 70-80 beats/minute. So we are left with I'SVT and Atrial flutter with block. - Atrial flutter has an atrial rate of 250-300 beat/minute and the heart rate is irregular but it is usually associated with fixed 2: 1 block so the heart rate drops to 150 b/m and the rate becomes regular. - So both PSVT and Atrial flutter can have regular heart rate of 150 b/m. - Both have sudden onset. There is nothing much to differentiate b/w supraventricular tachycardia and Atrial fibrillation. Supraventicrucular tachycardia seems to be the correct option because it is quite rare. for a normal person to develop atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation usually develops in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. The question does not give any information regarding this, so it can be assumed that he is a normal healthy person. Sudden palpitation in a normal healthy person is most likely due to supraventricular tachycardia.",

        "question": "True regarding male breast Ca?",
        "exp": "Ans is B (Estrogen receptor positive), Male Breast cancer Breast cancer in men is a rare disease; less than 1% occurs in men. The average age is about 60 yrs - older than the most common presenting age in women. Gynecomastia is seen preceding or accompanying the breast cancer in about 20% of cases. The risk of male breast cancer is related to an increased lifelong exposure to estrogen (as with female breast cancer) or to reduced androgen. The strongest association is in men with Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY) who have a 14- to 50-fold increased risk of developing male breast cancer. Also, men who carry a BRCA1, or paicularly a BRCA2 mutation, have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. The following conditions have been repoed to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in men: - chronic liver disorders, such as cirrhosis, chronic alcoholism, schistosomiasis; - a history of mumps orchitis, undescended testes, or testicular injury; and - feminization, genetically or by environmental exposure - radiation exposure All known histopathologic types of breast cancer have been described in men with infiltrating ductal carcinoma being most common (about 70%). A majority of male breast cancers are ER/PR positive and the percentage positive is greater than for female breast cancer. As for women, stage is the predominant prognostic indicator, and most studies repo that stage for stage, men with breast cancer have the same outcome following treatment as women with breast cancer. Overall, men do worse because of the advanced stage of their cancer at the time of diagnosis. Treatment consists of modified radical mastectomy in operable patients. The use of postmastectomy radiation therapy follows the same guidelines as for female breast cancer. Similarly, the use of systemic therapy follows the same guidelines as for women with postmenopausal breast cancer. Tamoxifen is the mainstay for adjuvant systemic therapy in ER-positive male breast cancer. Metastatic breast cancer in men is treated identically to metastatic disease in women* Note that: About Gynaecomastia Devita's Oncology writes? \"In contrast, gynecomastia alone does not appear to be a risk factor. \" Whereas Schwaz writes? \"Male breast cancer is preceded by gynecomastia in 20% of men. \"",

Following effects secondary to shock are seen: Cells are deprived of oxygen and hence switches over from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. Hypoxia and acidosis activate complement and prime neutrophils leading to injury of the capillary endothelial cells. The hallmark clinical indicators of shock have generally been the presence of abnormal vital signs, such as hypotension, tachycardia, decreased urine output, and altered mental status. These findings represent secondary effects of circulatory failure, not the primary etiologic event. Because of compensatory mechanisms, the effects of age, and use of ceain medications, some patients in shock will present with a normal blood pressure and pulse.",
