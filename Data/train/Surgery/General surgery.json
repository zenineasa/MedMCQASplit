Within this triad, there are factors predetermined by the status of the patient and by the type of procedure (e. g., contaminated versus clean, emergent versus elective). However, there are several factors that can be optimized by the surgeon. Decreasing the bacterial inoculum and virulence by limiting the patient's prehospital stay, clipping the operative site in the operating room, administering perioperative antibiotics (within a 24-h period surrounding operation) with an appropriate antimicrobial spectrum, treating remote infections, avoiding breaks in technique, using closed drainage systems (if needed at all) that exit the skin away from the surgical incision, and minimizing the duration of the operation have all been shown to decrease postoperative infection. Making a wound less orable to infection requires attention to basic halstedian principles of hemostasis, anatomic dissection, and gentle handling of tissues as well as limiting the amount of foreign body and necrotic tissue in the wound. Although they are the most difficult factors to influence, host defense mechanisms can be improved by optimizing nutritional status, tissue perfusion, and oxygen delivery.",

Hyperplastic type: This occurs when host resistance has the upper hand over the virulence of the organism. It is caused by drinking infected unpasteurised milk. There is a marked inflammatory reaction causing hyperplasia and thickening of the terminal ileum because of its abundance of lymphoid follicles, thus resulting in narrowing of the lumen and obstruction.

Any metabolic acidosis should be seen to be correcting. There-after, one must try to maintain normovolaemia. This is a continuous process. Critically ill patients may have capillary leak and will therefore have a continuing colloid requirement. Gelatins, being small molecules, are poorly retained and can be replaced by hydroxyethyl starch, plasma or blood at this stage. In sepsis this requirement may be very large. The impoance of blood in immediate resuscitation, the threshold at which one should transfuse urgently (i. e. con-sider using group compatible, uncross-matched blood or even Group 0 blood) and even the target hemoglobin level are controversial. Resuscitation should not be delayed whilst waiting for blood to be grouped; if acute anemia is secondary to the bleeding resuscitation should be with Group 0 blood or group-compatible blood as it becomes available.

Chronic wounds are chronically infected with biofilms which interfere mainly with the inflammatory phase of healing, contributing to the non-healing. A biofilm is a complex structure of microorganisms contained in an extracellular matrix of proteins and polysaccharides that adhere to a surface, creating a protected environment for the organisms. Chronic ulcers are unrespon- sive to dressing treatment; it requires biopsy, culture study, definitive treatment like wound debridement, VAC (Vacuum Assisted Closure) therapy, skin grafting or flap.

There is no ideal wound closure technique that would be appropriate for all situations, and the ideal suture has yet to be produced. Therefore, the correct choice of suture technique and suture material is vital, but will never compensate for inadequate operative technique, and, for any wound to heal well, there must be a good blood supply and no tension on the closure. Clean uninfected wounds with a good blood supply heal by primary intention and therefore closure simply requires accurate apposition of the wound edges. The edges should be inveed However, if a wound is left open, it heals by secondary intention through the formation of granulation tissue, which is tissue composed of capillaries, fibroblasts and inflammatory cells. Wound contraction and epithelialisation assist in ultimate healing, but the process may take several weeks or months. Delayed primary closure, or teiary intention, is utilised when there is a high probability of the wound being infected. The wound is left open for a few days and, provided any infective process has resolved, the wound is closed to heal by primary intention. Skin grafting is another form of teiary intention healing.

Normally, this would be at the tip of the active electrode, but if current passes up a narrow channel or pedicle to the active electrode, enough heat may be generated within this channel or pedicle to coagulate the tissues. This can prove disastrous, for example: coagulation of the penis in a child undergoing circumcision; coagulation of the spermatic cord when the electrode is applied to the testis. Capacitance coupling: This is a phenomenon in which a capacitor is created by having an insulator sandwiched between two metal electrodes.

A full blood count (FBC) is needed for major operations, in the elderly and in those with anemia or pathology with ongoing blood loss and chronic disease. In case of suspicion or history of sickle crisis, a sickle cell Test is needed in patients of Afro-Caribbean and Indian subcontinent origin. * Urea and electrolytes. Urea and electrolytes (U&Es) are needed before all major operations, in most patients over 65 years of age especially with cardiovascular, renal and endocrine disease, or if significant blood loss is anticipated. It is also needed in those on medications that affect electrolyte levels, e. g. steroids, diuretics, digoxin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intravenous fluid or nutrition therapy and endocrine problems. * Electrocardiography. Electrocardiography (ECG) is required for those patients over 65 years of age and symptomatic patients with a history of rheumatic fever, diabetes, cardiovascular, renal and cerebrovascular disease, with and without severe respiratory problems. It will also depend on if the surgery is minor/intermediate or major. * Chest radiograph. Cost-effectiveness and risks of radiationexposure mean that chest radiographs should be restricted to specific patients, such as those with cardiac failure, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory symptoms, pulmonary cancer, metastasis or effusions or those who are deemed to be at risk of active pulmonary tuberculosis. * Clotting screen. If a patient has a history suggestive of a bleeding diathesis, liver disease, eclampsia, cholestasis or has a family history of bleeding disorder, or is on antithrombotic or anticoagulant agents then coagulation screening will be needed. However, the effects of anti- platelet agents, low molecular weight heparins and newer agents affecting factor Xa cannot be measured by routine Laboratory tests. * Urinalysis. Dipstick testing of urine should be performed on all patients to detect urinary infection, biliuria, glycos- uria and inappropriate osmolality. * b-Human chorionic gonadotrophin. Women of child-bearing age should be asked sensitively about their pregnancy status. If in doubt a laboratory test or a reliable pregnancy kit (low cost) can be used, after obtaining consent from the patient, to avoid danger of exposure to surgery and anaesthesia on the foetus. * Blood glucose and Hb. A1c. Poor control of diabetes can lead to perioperative infection and slow recovery in patients with diabetes mellitus and endocrine problems. Hb. A1C indicates how well diabetes has been controlled over a longer duration. Early mobilisation, oral intake and return to routine medication should be the goals in management of diabetes. * Aerial blood gases. A low-cost tool that can give quick and vital information in acute or chronic severe respiratory conditions, acid-base disturbances and conditions where there is changing milieu, e. g. immediately before kidney transplant. * Liver function tests. These are indicated in patients with jaundice, known or suspected hepatitis, cirrhosis, malignancy or in patients with poor nutritional status. * Other investigations. Specialist radiological views and recent imaging are sometimes required. If imaging is going to be needed during surgery, then this needs to be planned in advance.
