D: Spleen Splenic rupture should be considered in any case of blunt abdominal trauma, paicularly when the injury occurs to the left upper quadrant of the abdomen Although protected under the bony ribcage, the spleen remains the most commonly affected organ in blunt injury to the abdomen in all age groups. These injuries are common in both rural and urban environments and result from motor vehicle crashes, domestic violence, spoing events, and accidents involving bicycle handlebars. The clinical presentation of splenic injury is highly variable. Most patients with minor focal injury to the spleen complain of left upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Left shoulder tenderness may also be present as a result of subdiaphragmatic nerve root irritation with referred pain. With free intraperitoneal blood, diffuse abdominal pain, peritoneal irritation, and rebound tenderness are more likely. If the intra-abdominal bleeding exceeds 5-10% of blood volume, clinical signs of early shock may manifest. Hypotension in a patient with a suspected splenic injury, especially if young and previously healthy, is a grave sign and a surgical emergency.",

        "question": "In cases of burn, which is the fluid of choice in the first 24 hours?",
        "exp": "Proper fluid management is critical to survival in a burn patient. The hypovolemic shock in burn patient is special in the sense that the total body water remains unchanged in a burn patient. The thermal injury leads to a massive fluid shift from the intravascular compartment to the extravascular compartment (interstitial + intracellular) leading to edema formation (in both burned parts and non burned parts of the body) This fluid shift is maximum in the first 24 hrs. Fluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution - Ringer's lactate solution (RL) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extravascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume. The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i. e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas) half of the calculated fluid is given in the first 8 hrs and a half in next 16 hrs. Colloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capillaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning) A number of parameters are widely used to assess burn resuscitation, but the most common remains the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patient, the target MAP is 60 mm. Hg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1. 5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients. There is no use of diuretics in burn resuscitation. Children under 20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",

See the below quoted texts in suppo. \"Inseional tendonitis is inflammation at the tendon's bony insetion, which can result from overuse or acute injury. \"- A thletic training and spos medicine By Robe C. Schenck, American Academy of Ohopaedic Surgeons p133 \"Achilles tendonitis in high-level athletes is usually a sign of faulty training, improper running techniques, or overuse. \"- Current diagnosis & treatment in spos medicine By Patrick J. Mc. Mahon 1/e pill \"Achilles tendonitis is the most common form of overuse tendonitis seen in athletes.....

The typical scar is 1. 5 to 2 cm long and should be completely excised. The proximal and distal urethra can be mobilized for a tension-free, end-to-end anastomosis. This is a highly successful procedure in more than 95% of cases. Endoscopic incision (urethrotomy) through the scar tissue of an obliterated urethra is a hopeless procedure and uniformly fails. Partial urethral narrowing can initially be treated by endoscopic incision with higher success. It is now recognized that repeated urethrotomy and dilation is neither clinically effective nor cost-effective for the treatment of urethral strictures. Further, patients who have had repeated endoscopic procedures are also more likely to require complex reconstructive procedures such as grafts\" - Campbell's Urology \"Urethroplasty should be considered when the stricture has arisen following trauma, and when a stricture has recurred following endoscopic treatment. \"- Bailey Urethroplasty can be of two types: excision and end-to-end anastomosis- done for short stricture segments ( <= 2 cm) patch urethroplasty- for longer segments",

        "exp": "Positive family history is definitively the most significant risk factor of developing breast cancer among the ones mentioned in the list. About 5% to 10% of cases are attributable to inheritance of autosomal dominant genes. Most hereditary cases of breast cancer are due to two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are tumor suppressor genes probably involved in DNA repair. There are additional rare \"susceptibility\" genes, namely those causing Li-Fraumeni syndrome (mutations of p53), Cowden syndrome (mutations of a gene on chromosome 10), and ataxia-telangiectasia (mutations of ATM gene). Note, however, that 80% to 90% of women with breast cancer do not have a positive family history. The role of exogenous estrogens, including those administered with bih control pills or postmenopausal replacement therapy, is still debated.

Carbon monoxide (CO) diffusing capacity provides an estimate of the rate at which oxygen moves by diffusion from alveolar gas to combine with hemoglobin in the red blood cells. It is interpreted as an index of the surface area engaged in alveolar-capillary diffusion. Measurement of diffusing capacity of the lung is done by having the person inspire a low concentration of carbon monoxide. The rate of uptake of the gas by the blood is calculated from the difference between the inspired and expired concentrations. The test can be performed during a single 10-second breath holding or during 1 minute of steady-state breathing. The diffusing capacity is defined as the amount of carbon monoxide transferred per minute per millimeter of mercury of driving pressure and correlates with oxygen transpo from the alveolus into the capillaries. Primary parenchymal disorders, anemia, and removal of lung tissue decrease the diffusing capacity. Conversely, polycythemia, congestive heart failure, and intrapulmonary hemorrhage tend to increase the value for diffusing capacity.

Increased ICP One of the most damaging aspects of brain trauma and other conditions, directly correlated with poor outcome, is an elevated intracranial pressure. The body's response to a decrease in CPP is to raise blood pressure and dilate blood vessels in the brain. This results in increased cerebral blood volume, which increases ICP, lowering CPP fuher and causing a vicious cycle. Neurologic changes seen in increased ICP are mostly due to hypoxia and hypercapnea and are as follows: decreased LOC, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, hyperventilation, sluggish dilated pupils and widened pulse pressure. Signs and symptoms of increased ICP In general, symptoms and signs that suggest a rise in ICP including headache, nausea, vomiting, ocular palsies, altered level of consciousness, and papilledema. If papilledema is protracted, it may lead to visual disturbances, optic atrophy, and eventually blindness. In addition to the above, if mass effect is present with resulting displacement of brain tissue, additional signs may include pupillary dilatation, abducens (CrN VI) palsies, and the Cushing's triad. Cushing's triad involves an increased systolic blood pressure, a widened pulse pressure, bradycardia, and an abnormal respiratory pattern. In children, a slow heart rate is especially suggestive of high ICP. Irregular respirations occur when injury to pas of the brain interfere with the respiratory drive. In infants and small children, the effects of ICP differ because their cranial sutures have not closed. In infants, the fontanelles, or soft spots on the head where the skull bones have not yet fused, bulge when ICP gets too high.",

During this period the reflex arcs below the level of spinal cord injury are not functioning. Spinal shock is basically flaccid paralysis with loss of all spinal reflexes. There is loss of autonomic, reflex, motor and sensory activity below the level of the cord lesion. Signs of spinal shock include: 1. Flaccid paralysis 2. Loss of deep tendon and perianal reflexes The return of reflex activity below the level of a spinal cord injury signifies the end of spinal shock. o An accurate assessment of neurological status cannot be completed until spinal shock resolves. The earliest indicator of resolution is the return of bulbocavernous reflex. The significance of spinal shock lies in the determination of whether a patient has sustained a complete vs incomplete spinal cord injury. This cannot be determined until spinal shock has ended. If there is total absence of sensory or motor function below the level of in jury, after spinal shock has resolved, It indicates complete cord injury. If there is some residual function distal to the level of injury after resolution of spinal shock indicates incomplete cord injury.

Crystalloids are aqueous solutions of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules. Colloids contain larger insoluble molecules, such as albumin; blood itself is a colloid. Colloids preserve a high colloid osmotic pressure in the blood, while, on the other hand, this parameter is decreased by crystalloids due to hemodilution. Another difference is that crystalloids generally are much cheaper than colloids. The most commonly used crystalloid fluid is normal saline, a solution of sodium chloride at 0. 9% concentration, which is close to the concentration in the blood (isotonic). Ringer's lactate or Ringer's acetate is another isotonic solution often used for large-volume fluid replacement.

PMPS can occur with any surgery to the breast, including mastectomy, lumpectomy, reconstruction, and augmentation. PMPS can be divided into three categories: phantom breast pain, intercostobrachial neuralgia, and neuroma pain. Phantom pain consists of painful sensations in the area of the removed breast. The intercostobrachial nerve is the lateral cutaneous nerve of the second thoracic root. It courses along the axillary vein and then provides sensation to the axilla and breast. The intercostobrachial nerve is frequently stretched or sacrificed during axillary lymph node dissections and is a common cause of PMPS. The scar from breast surgery can be a generator of pain. The pain has been attributed to underlying neuroma formation, axon impingement, and scar retraction. The symptoms associated with PMPS include shooting, stabbing, burning, and pins and needles in the breast, axilla, or medial arm.

Diabetes is considered to be the most common cause of Charcot ahropathy Acute Charcot ahropathy almost always presents with signs of inflammation. Profound unilateral swelling, an increase in local skin temperature (generally, an increase of 3-7 degrees above the nonaffected foot's skin temperature), erythema, joint effusion, and bone resorption in an insensate foot are present. These characteristics, in the presence of intact skin and a loss of protective sensation, are often pathognomonic of acute Charcot ahropathy. Pain can occur in more than 75% of patients; however, the pain's severity is significantly less than would be expected based on the severity of the clinical and/or radiographic findings. Instability and loss of joint function also may be present.

        "exp": "Insulin + glucose Tall T waves on ECG indicate cardiac manifestation of hyperkalemia. - Intravenous calcium gluconate is the first drug to be administered in a patient with hyperkalemia having E. C. G. abnormalities. - It stabilizes the myocardium immediately. - It acts within minutes and is characterized by improvement in E. C. G. appearance. But an impoant point to note - It does not affect transcellular movement of potassium. Thus it won't help in reducing the hyperkalemia. Among the agents which cause transcellular (intracellular) movement of potassium. - \"Intravenous insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levels\". The goals of the therapy for the tit of acute hyperkalemia in chronological order are as follows:? i) Antagonize the affect of IC on excitable cell membranes ii) Redistribution of extracellular potassium into cells iii) Enhance elimination of potassium from the body i) Antagonize the effect of potassium on excitable cell membrane Calcium directly antagonizes the myocardial effect of hyperkalemia. It does so by reducing the threshold potential of cardiac myocytes. Calcium. for injection is available as chloride or gluconate salt. The preferred agent is the gluconate salt since it is less likely than calcium chloride to cause tissue necrosis. The onset of action is < 3 minutes. The duration of action is 30-60 minutes during which time fuher measures may be undeaken to lower p1{. ii) Redistribution of potassium into cells:? Insulin Insulin shifts potassium into cells. Potassium shift inside the cells is mediated by Na+ IC ATPase. I. V. insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levelr2. The onset of action is < 15 minutes and the effect is maximal b/w 30-60 minutes. Dextrose is given along with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. It was believed that administration of dextrose alone, can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin release. * The administration of hypeonic dextrose alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasons:- Endogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for a therapeutic effect. - There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypeonicity. 5' adrenoceptor agonists These drugs can also cause movement of potassium inside the cell. High dose albuterol shows their effect in 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours. The effect of insulin is additive with that of albuterol. Patients taking nonselective 18 adrenoceptor blockers will be unlikely to manifest the hypokalemic effects of albuterol. - Even among patients not taking ft blockers as many as 40% seem to be resistant to the hypokalemic effect of albuterol. - The mechanism. for this resistance is unknown and currently, there is no basis for predicting which patients will respond. - For this reason albuterol should never be used as a single agent for the treatment of urgent hyperkalemia. Bicarbonate Bicarbonate (as a bolus injection) was used in the emergency t/t of hyperkalemia. Ironically this dogma was based on studies using a prolonged (4-6 hrs) infusion of bicarbonate. It has now been demonstrated that sho term bicarbonate infusion does not reduce pK in patients with dialysis dependent kidney failure, implying that it does not cause IC+ shift into cells. Sodium bicarbonate seems to have no effect to shift IC into cells even after several hours. It is likely to be effective especially in combination with a diuretic drug in enhancing urinary IC' elimination in patients with some kidney. function, although it use for this purpose has not been evaluated. iii) Elimination of potassium from the body Hyperkalemia occurs most often in patients with renal insufficiency. - However renal potassium excretion may be enhanced even in patients with significant renal impairment by increasing the delivery of solute to the distal nephron. Sodium bicarbonate A sodium bicarbonate infusion administered during 4-6 hrs at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine may enhance urinary K+ excretion and would be desirable especially in patients with metabolic acidosis. The risk of volume expansion with the bicarbonate infusion can be mitigated by use of loop acting diuretics which would, be likely to enhance the kaliuresis. Exchange resin Sodium polysterene sulfonate is a cation exchange resin. In the lumen of intestine it exchanges sodium for secreted potassium. Most of this exchange takes place in the colon, the site of most potassium secretion in the gut. There are two concerns with the use of resin in the t/t of urgent hyperkalemia The first is its slow effect - When given orally, the onset of action is at least 2 hrs and the maximum effect may not be seen for more than 6 hrs. The second is its adverse effect - It can cause intestinal necrosis Dialysis -\"Hemodialysis is the method of choice for removing potassium from the body\". - The rate of potassium removed with peritoneal dialysis is much slower than with hemodialysis.",

It is believed or proposed that due to ischemia the heart is stunned. for a period of time. So even after the blood flow is restored the heart will not regain its function immediately.

Its should be noted that myocardial stunning is a fully reversible abnormally, provided of course that sufficient time is allowed for myocardiunt to recover. Hibernating and stunned myocardium are clinically very impoant conditions of contractile asynergy, since they are potentially reversible Hibernating myocardium is similar to stunned myocardium in that both are characterized by ble myocardial cell with depressed function.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common inherited single gene disorder. It is characterized by increased intestinal absorption of iron, with deposition of iron in multiple organs. Persons with hereditary hemochromatosis absorb only a few milligrams of iron each day in excess of need. Therefore, clinical manifestations often occur only after 40 years of age, when body iron stores have reached 15-40g (normally, the body stores approximately 4g of iron). In the past hereditary hemochromatosis was usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. The classical description was:? - Cutaneous hyperpigmentation. - Diabetes mellitus - Cirrhosis Currently, most patients with newly diagnosed hereditary hemochromatosis are asymptomatic i. e., diagnosed at an early state when the patient is still asymptomatic. The shift towards earlier diagnosis is probably the result of including serum iron indices in the diagnosis. Such as: Serum iron - Serum iron binding capacity - % transferrin saturation and serum ferritin These are elevated in hemochromatosis long before the symptoms of hemochromatosis have developed. Therefore serum iron indices are used as screening test for the diagnosis of Heruochromatosis. A. Percent transferrin saturation Percent transferrin saturation is the earliest phenotypic marker of hereditary hemoehromatosisQ. \"It is the best screening test used for the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. \" Biron binding capacity Now days iron binding capacity is being increasingly used as the screening test for the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. Many trials have proved that: Iron binding capacity is better than % transferrin saturation as a screening test, but its wide scale use has not been staed till now. C. Serum Ferritin Serum ferritin concentration is usually a good index of body iron stores. Serum ferritin is increased in most untreated patients with hemochromatosis. Asymptomatic or symptomatic family members with the disease have increased serum ferritin. But serum ferritin is not used as screening marker because its act as acute phase reactant and its level is increased in various inflammatory conditions. Besides that its level is also increased in alcoholic liver disease and other hepatocellular injury due to increased release from tissues. Confirmatory testing of hereditary hemochromatosis: Is done by genetic analysis, which is more reliable than determining iron content in liver biopsies. Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with mutations in the HFE genee. Between 60-93 percent of patients with this disorder are homozygous for mutation designated C282. Ye.

Biopsy First investigation is -------> FNAC Best & the definitive investigation is -------> Open biopsy Preferred method -------> Core needle biopsy \"Core-needle biopsy is the preferred method for diagnosis of palpable or nonpalpable breast abnormalities. \" - Schwaz 9/e p425 The diagnosis of breast cancer depends ultimately upon examination of tissue or cells removed by biopsy or FNAC (also known as FNA biopsy). The treatment should never be undeaken without a confirmed diagnosis of cancer. Thus a biopsy (biopsy includes all kinds of biopsy including FNA biopsy, also known as FNAC) should be done of all suspicious masses found on physical examination and in the absence of a mass of suspicious lesions demonstrated by mammography. A breast mass should not be followed without a biopsy. Exception to this is perhaps in the premenopausal woman with a nonsuspicious mass presumed to be fibrocystic disease. A lesion such as this could be observed through one or two menstrual cycles. However if the mass does not completely resolve during this time, it must be biopsied. For biopsy, FNAC (or FNAB) is the simplest method Schwaz writes - \"The combination of diagnostic mammography, ultrasound or sterotactic localization and fine needle aspiration biopsy is almost 100% accurate in the diagnosis of breast cancer. However while FNA biopsy permits cytological evaluation, core-needle or open biopsy also permits the analysis of breast tissue architecture and allows the pathologist to determine whether invasive cancer is present. Core-needle biopsy is preferred over open biopsy for nonpalpable breast lesions because a single surgical procedure can be planned based on the results of the core biopsy. The advantages of core-needle biopsy include a low complication rate, avoidance of scarring, and a lower cost. \" CSDT writes? \"Open biopsy under local anaesthesia as a separate procedure prior to deciding upon definitive treatment is the most reliable means of diagnosis. \"",

        "exp": "Answer is 'a' ie An adenolymphoma of parotid gland Wahin's tumor Is the second most common benign tumor of the parotid gland (151 is pleomorphic adenoma). It consists of both epithelial and lymphoid elements thus known as adenolymphoma (probably arises from remnants of parotid tissue trapped in lymphnodes within the parotid gland). Also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum. The tumor arises only in the parotid gland. Almost always arises in the lower poion of the parotid gland overlying the angle of mandible. Common in males. (Occurs most often in older white men) Age: 54h to 7th decade. Association is seen with smoking. Bilaterality is seen in 10% cases. Its well encapsulated, extremely slow growing tumor, never turns malignant. A peculiar feature of Wahins tumor is that it shows 'hot' spot in 99'n Tc-peechnate scan. Other tumors of the parotid show 'cold' spot (Oncocytomas another benign parotid tumor also shows hot spot). (Because of the high mitochondrial content within oncocytes, the oncocyte-rich Wahin tumor and Oncocytomas incorporate technetium Tc 99m and appear as hot spots on radionuclide scans.) Also remember Godwin 's tumor - Benign lymphoepithelial tumor of the parotid gland. Most salivary gland tumors are benign. However remember that the smaller the salivary gland, the higher is the chance of the tumor being malignant. Parotid gland --> 80% benign Submandibular, Sublingual 50% benign, 50% malignant Minor salivary glands ---> 25% benign, 75% malignant",

Blood has also role in burn patient. The need for Blood replacement is significant in extensive burns. Besides injury to red blood cells and their decreased half-life resulting in their early destruction, many patients may be anaemic. Hence, repeated and frequent transmission to maintain a hematocrit around 35% is necessary. Schwartz 9/e p201 writes- \"The role of blood transfusion in burns has undergone a re-evaluation in recent years. A large multicenter study found that increased numbers of transfusions were associated with increased infections and a higher mortality rate in burn patients, even when correcting for burn severity. A follow-up study implanting a restrictive transfusion policy in burned children showed that a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL had no more adverse outcomes versus a traditional transfusion trigger of 10 g/dL. These data, in concert with other reported complications such as transfusion-related lung injury, have led to recommendations that blood transfusions be used only when there is an apparent physiologic need. \"",

The purpose of this procedure is to facilitate the flow of bile into the intestine. It is based on the observation that the fibrous tissue at the pa hepatitis invests microscopically patent biliary ductules that in turn communicates with the intrahepatic ductal system. Transecting this fibrous tissue, opens these channels and establishes bile flow into a surgically constructed intestinal conduit, using a Roux-en-Y limb of jejunum. Liver transplantation is done in those, who fail to respond to Pooenterostomy. About prognostic factors for successful outcome of the Kasai operation, we have consulted many books including books on Pediatric Surgery. The maximum information we could get was from CSDT, Maingot's and Schwaz. The prognostic factors are: a) Age of operation - a better prognosis is achieved with age less than 60 days (8 weeks given in 8th edition of Schwaz). b) Absence of cirrhosis - checked by bridging liver fibrosis on biopsy. c) Diameter of bile ductules at the poal plate - ductules greater than 150 gm in diameter are associated with good chances of bile drainage (- Maingot 10/e, p 2123) d) Establishment of adequate bile flow e) Cholangitic episodes - postoperative cholangitic episodes are associated with bad prognosis.",

Pehe's disease is an osteochondritis of the epiphysis of the femoral head (capital femoral epiphysis). In the disease, the femoral head becomes paly or wholly avascular and deformed. The disease occurs commonly in males in the age group of 5-10 years. Etiology of Pehe's disease Pehe's disease is the most common form of osteochondroses (osteochondroses are characterized by avascular necrosis (AVN) and defective endochondral ossification of primary or secondary ossification centers). The etiology remains unknown, but is currently accepted that the disorder is caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the capital femoral epiphysis, causing avascular necrosis. Clinical features of Pehes disease Pehes disease is common in male of age group 5-10 years. Pain in the hip, often radiating to knee. Limp (antalgic limp). Limitation of movement:- Abduction, internal rotation and extension are limited, therefore there is adduction, external rotation, and flexion deformity. Shoening of limb. Positive trendelenburg test. During the disease process, bone age is 1-3 years lower than the normal. After healing, bone age returns to normal. Radiological investigations for Pehe's disease Following radiological investigations are used: 1) X-ray hip Findings are:- Increased medial joint space Widening of femoral neck Lateral extrusion (lateral subluxation) Metaphyseal cysts and rarefaction of metaphysis Horizontal physis with speckled calcification lateral to it Fragmentation of femoral head with increased density (irregular densities in the epiphysis) 2) Bone scan May show a decrease uptake by femoral head. 3) MRI It is the investigation of choice as it can diagnose Pehes disease in early stages when X-ray is normal. MRI tells about:- Extent of area involved Sphericity of the head Subluxation of the head Thus MRI helps better in planning for management.",

        "exp": "Next Step: Diagnosis by demonstration of posterior urethral valves. Posterior urethral valves, the most common obstructive urethral lesions in infants and newborns, occur only in males and are found at the distal prostatic urethra. Demonstration of urethral valves on a voiding cystourethrogram establishes the diagnosis, as does endoscopic identification of valves. 2 possible answers for this question. a) Micturating Cystourethrogram b) Endoscopic identification of valve (in an emergency) In this question answer is Micturating Cystourethrogram. However, endoscopy is better because of severe obstruction indicated by b/l hydronephrosis and oligohydramnios. It can be clubbed with endoscopic destruction of the valve. Impoant: What does USG do? 1. Ultrasonography can be used to detect hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and bladder distension in children with severe azotemia. 2. It can also detect fetal hydronephrosis, which is typical of urethral valves, as early as 28 weeks of gestation - an enlarged bladder with bilateral hydroureteronephrosis is usually present in PUV. Treatment consists of destruction of the valves, but the approach depends on the degree of obstruction and the general health of the child. Treatment consists of destruction of the valves by endoscopic incision. In a premature infant with a small urethra prohibiting transurethral resection, a temporary cutaneous vesicostomy may be required to provide drainage and improve impaired kidney function.

At the upper end, the surgical neck of the humerus and anatomical neck of humerus can both be involved, though fractures of the surgical neck are more common. The axillary nerve can be damaged in fractures of this type. Mid-shaft fractures may damage the radial nerve, which traverses the lateral aspect of the humerus closely associated with the radial groove.

        "exp": "Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection of the scalp that may cause multiple patches of alopecia and severe itching. The dermatophytoses are diseases caused by a group of closely related filamentous fungi with a propensity for invading the stratum corneum, hair, and nails. Dermatophyte infections are designated by the word tinea, followed by the Latin name of the site. Thus, tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection of the head. The three genera generally responsible for dermatophyte infections are Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. Both Microsporum and Trichophyton species commonly cause tinea capitis. The most common pathogens are Trichophyton tonsurans followed by Microsporum canis. These two pathogens are distinguished by the fact that hairs infected with Microsporum species fluoresce a bright blue green color whereas those infected by Trichophyton species usually do not fluoresce. In addition, T. tousurans often causes a unique pattern on the scalp known as \"black dot ringworm, \" characterized by circular patches of alopecia with hairs broken off close to the follicle. Epidermophyton species usually iuvade the iuteriginous skin, not the scalp. Epidermophyton floccosum is a cause of tinea crnsis, not tinea capitis. Neither Candida nor Aspergillus species are dermatophytes. Candida albicans is responsible for oral thrush and, in infants, diaper dermatitis.

History of previous radiation Conservative breast cancer management: Absolute Contraindications Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to the use of breast irradiation. However, in many cases, it may be possible to perform breast-conserving surgery in the third trimester and treat the patient with irradiation after delivery. Women with two or more primary tumors in separate quadrants of the breast or with diffuse malignant-appearing microcalcifications are not considered candidate for breast conservation treatment. A history of prior therapeutic irradiation to the breast region that would require retreatment to an excessively high total-radiation dose to a significant volume is another absolute contraindication. Persistent positive margins after reasonable surgical attempts. Relative Contraindications A history of collagen vascular disease is a relative contraindication to breast conservation treatment because published repos indicate that such patients tolerate irradiation poorly. Most radiation oncologists will not treat patients with scleroderma or active lupus erythematosus, considering it an absolute contraindication. In contrast, rheumatoid ahritisis not a relative or an absolute contraindication. The presence of multiple gross tumors in the same quadrant and indeterminate calcifications must be carefully assessed for suitability because studies in this area are not definitive. Tumor size is not an absolute contraindication to breast conservation treatment, although there is little published experience in treating patients with tumor sizes greater than four to five cm. However, a relative contraindication is the presence of a large tumor in a small breast in which an adequate resection would result in significant cosmetic alteration. In this circumstance, preoperative chemotherapy should be considered. Breast size can be a relative contraindication. Large pendulous breast is a relative contraindication, as it presents difficulty in delivering a uniform radiation dose. Centrally located tumor for which removal of the nipple areola complex is required to obtain a tumor free margin is a relative contraindication. It depends on patient acceptability.

The best indicators of likely prognosis in breast cancer remain tumour size and lymph node status, which are components of stage of a tumour. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the worse is the prognosis. The stage is raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive.

Etiology The thyroid gland is inherently resistant to infection due to its extensive blood and lymphatic supply, high iodide content, and fibrous capsule. Infectious Agents can Seed Thyroid 1. Via hematogenous or lymphatic route 2. Via direct spread from persistent pyriform sinus fistulae or thyroglossal duct cysts 3. As a result of penetrating trauma 4. Due to immunosuppression \u2022 Streptococcus and anaerobes account for about 70% of cases. \u2022 In children and young adults, MC cause is presence of a pyriform sinus (remnant of the fourth branchial pouch that connects the oropharynx with thyroid), such sinuses are predominantly left-sided. \u2022 Long-standing goiter and degeneration in thyroid malignancy are risk factors in elderly. Clinical Features \u2022 Thyroid pain, often referred to the throat or ears, and a small, tender goiter. \u2022 Fever, dysphagia and erythema over the thyroid. \u2022 Systemic symptoms of a febrile illness and lymphadenopathy. \u2022 Complications such as systemic sepsis, tracheal or esophageal rupture, jugular vein thrombosis, laryngeal chondritis, and perichondritis or sympathetic trunk paralysis may also occur. Diagnosis \u2022 ESR and WBC count are usually increased, but thyroid function is normal. \u2022 FNA biopsy shows infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. \u2022 Culture of the sample can identify the organism. \u2022 Persistent pyriform sinus fistula should be suspected in children with recurrent acute thyroiditis. A barium swallow demonstrates the anomalous tract with 80% sensitivity.

Previous measurements of plasma creatinine concentration are paicularly helpful in this regard. Normal values from recent months or even years suggest that the current extent of renal dysfunction could be more acute, and hence reversible, than might otherwise be appreciated. In contrast, elevated plasma creatinine concentration in the past suggests that the renal disease represents the progression of a chronic process. Even if there is evidence of chronicity, there is the possibility of a superimposed acute process, such as ECFV depletion, supervening on the chronic condition. If the history suggests multiple systemic manifestations of recent onset (e. g., fever, polyahritis, and rash) it should be assumed that renal insufficiency is pa of the acute process. From the following staging of CKD based on GFR it is clear that GFT can be even normal in initial staged of CKD Clinical action plan Stage Description GFR, mL/min per 1. 73 m2 Action' 1 Kidney damage with normal or +GFR > or = 90 Diagnosis and treatment, treatment of comorbid conditions, slowing progression, CVD risk reduction 2 Kidney damage with mild +GFR 60-89 Estimating progression 3 Moderate +GFR 30-59 Evaluating and treating complications 4 Severe +GFR 15-29 Preparation for kidney replacement therapy 5 Kidney failure <15 (or dialysis) Kidney replacement (if uremia present)",

Near total thyroidectomy with radioiodine & radiotherapy As already mentioned in previous question, Total or Near total thyroidectomy is t/t of choice in PTC and also FTC (except minimally invasive cancer). Radioactive iodine '3'1is used post-operatively to detect and destroy any metastatic disease. It is also advised by some expes to do a routine 1311scan and therapy for all patients of differentiated thyroid cancer, postoperatively (except those with occult or minimally invasive disease). Screening with RAI is more sensitive than chest x-ray or CT scanning for detecting metastases; however, it is less sensitive than Tg measurements for detecting metastatic disease in most differentiated thyroid cancers except Huhle cell tumors. External beam radiotherapy is used to treat bone metastasis (to prevent fracture or to control pain). It is also occasionally used to control unresectable, locally invasive or recurrent thyroid carcinoma. There is no role for routine chemotherapy in differentiated thyroid cancers. Other Postop management in differentiated thyroid cancers Thyroid Hormone T4 is given as replacement therapy in patients after total or near-total thyroidectomy, and has the additional effect of suppressing TSH and reducing the growth stimulus for any possible residual thyroid cancer cells. TSH suppression reduces tumor recurrence rates. Thyroglobulin measurement Thyroglobulin (Tg) is produced only by thyroid follicular cells. Following total thyroidectomy, it should be undetectable in serum and any detectable level then indicates the persistence or recurrence of neoplastic disease. This is the basis for the use of Tg as a post-operative tumor marker in the follow-up of thyroid cancer patients Tg levels in patients who have undergone total thyroidectomy should be <2 ng/mL when the patient is taking T4, and <5 ng/mL when the patient is hypothyroid.",

A 24-hour urine collection reveals an elevated level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a metabolite of serotonin. An abdominal CT scan shows a 2-cm mesenteric mass in the ileum and likely metastatic tumors in the liver. What is the likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "One of the main secretory products of carcinoid tumors involved in the carcinoid syndrome is serotonin, which is synthesized from tryptophan. Serotonin production is characteristic of gut carcinoid tumors. Serotonin is metabolized to 5-HIAA. Therefore, finding high levels of 5-HIAA in a 24-hour urine collection in a patient with flushing or other symptoms is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Serotonin has numerous biologic effects, including stimulating intestinal secretion with inhibition of absorption, stimulating increases in intestinal motility, and stimulating fibrogenesis. In various studies 56-88% of all carcinoid tumors were associated with serotonin overproduction; however, 12-26% of the patients did not have the carcinoid syndrome. In one study platelet serotonin was elevated in 96% of patients with midgut carcinoids, 43% with foregut tumors, and 0% with hindgut tumors. In 90-100% of patients with the carcinoid syndrome there is evidence of serotonin overproduction. Serotonin is thought to be predominantly responsible for the diarrhea because of its effects on gut motility and intestinal secretion, primarily through 5-HT3 and, to a lesser degree, 5-HT4 receptors.

Patients usually give a history of abnormal menses; either missing one or two periods or noting only slight vaginal bleeding. The diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy should be relatively easy. The presence of a pelvic mass and elevated levels of chorionic gonadotropin are characteristic While the leukocyte count rises slightly (to approx. 14, 000), the hematocrit level falls as a consequence of the intraabdominal haemorrhage.

Total knee replacement - Ahlbeck grade 2 osteoahritis (i. e. complete or almost complete obliterated joint space) with symptoms of pain and swelling in a sedentary patient (>65 years of age) is managed by knee replacementQ - Old (65 yrs) age, long standing history of pain & swelling interfering activities of daily living and grade III radiological grade of OA indicate moderately severe OA and is best managed by Total knee ahroplasty. Although it must be remembered that TKA is done only after conservative treatment measures have been exhausted. And in this case we have presumed that conservative treatment must have been tried (b/o long course) & failed. - Because ahroscopic lavage (wash out) provides symptomatic improvements in patients with normal alignment, joint space >3mmQ, stable ligaments, unicompamental OA with relevant osteophytes at the site of symptom, loose bodies, minimal Fair bank lesions, meniscal flap tear, chondral fracture/flap and outerbridge I or II lesions. And patients with bi/tri compamental OA, malalignment, irrelevant osteophytes away from symptom site, diffuse chondrosis, degenerative meniscus, significant Fair bank lesion and outbridge III or IV are poor prognostic factors for ahroscopic debridement. So obliterated joint space rules out the possibility of conservative and ahroscopic treatments. - High tibial osteotomy is indicated in physiologically young (years) and active patients with unicompamental OA of tibiofemoral jointsQ.

Intra aerial injections of hyaluronic acid & steroid may be helpful in early minimal ahritis. Ahroscopic lavage (wash out) provides symptomatic improvements in patients with normal alignment, joint space >3mmQ, stable ligaments, unicompamental OA with relevant osteophytes at the site of symptom, loose bodies, minimal Fair bank lesions, meniscal flap tear, chondral fracture/flap and outerbridge I or II lesions. And patients with bi/tri compamental OA, malalignment, irrelevant osteophytes away from symptom site, diffuse chondrosis, degenerative meniscus, significant Fair bank lesion and outbridge III or IV are poor prognostic factors for ahroscopic debridement. Total (Tricompamental) Knee Replacement (TKR): Indications - Primary indication of TKR is to relieve pain caused by severe ahritis with or without significant deformityQ. Radiological finding must correlate with clinical impression of knee ahritis. Patient who do not have complete cailage space loss before surgery tend to be less satisfied with their clinical result after TKR. - Severe pain from chondrocalcinosis & pseudogout in an elderly patient is an occasional indication of TKR in absence of complete cailage space loss. Severe patellofemoral ahritis in elderly may justify TKR because the expected outcome is better than that of patellectomy in these patients. - Osteonecrosis with subchondral collapse of femoral condyle. - Because knee replacement has a finite expected survival that is adversely affected by activity level, it generally is indicated in older patients with more sedentary life styles. It is preferable that patients undergoing TKA have a remaining normal life expectancy of between 20 & 30 years so that need for a repeat ahroplasty for a failed TKA will be minimal. It is clearly indicated in young patients who have limited function b/o systemic ahritis (eg rheumatoid ahritis) with multiple joint involvement. But the patient must understand the limitations of the procedure, be willing to modify life style to prolong the life of prosthesis and be willing to risk the lower success rate in a revision TKA. - Deformity can become the principle indication for TKR in patient with moderate ahritis & variable levels of pain when the progression of deformity begins to threaten the expected outcome of an anticipated TKR. This includes flexion contractures beyond 20deg and vurus/ valgus laxity. However, deformity without pain is not a suitable indication for surgery as it may be well tolerated by elderly. - Indications for leaving the patella unresurfaced are, a primary diagnosis of OA, satisfactory patellar cailage with no eburnated bone, congruent patello femoral tracking, a normal anatomical patellar shape and no evidence of crystalline or inflammatory ahropathy and lighter weight of patient. TKR: Contraindications - Absolute contraindications include recent or current knee infection; a remote source of ongoing infection; extensor mechanism discontinuity or severe dysfunction; recurvatum deformity secondary to muscular weakness; and presence of painless, well functioning knee ahrodesis. - Relative contraindications include fragile medical conditions, severe atherosclerotic disease of operative leg, skin conditions such as psoriasis within the operative field, venous stasis disease with recurrent cellulitis, neuropathic ahropathy, morbid obesity, recurrent UTI, and a h/o osteomyelitis in the proximity of knee.",

        "exp": "Ileal segment is the best for urinary diversion after cystectomy. Still better method is \"Continent cutaneous diversion\" method. But the best method is \"Orthotopic neobladders\". \"Incontinent cutaneous urinary diversion\" by ileal conduit: a segment of ileum is exteriorized in the form of a stoma through the abdominal wall, around which an appliance is secured and into which urine continuously drains. \"Continent cutaneous diversions\" - All continent cutaneous reservoirs rely upon a low-pressure pouch constructed of various detubularized bowel segments and a functional mechanism that connects the reservoir to the skin, designed to prevent involuntary urine flow. The most obvious advantages of this type of diversion are the ability to avoid continuous urine drainage and the need for an external appliance. These continent cutaneous diversions require intermittent clean self-catheterization through the stoma both to empty the reservoir and to irrigate mucous. No stomal appliance is usually required. Although continent cutaneous diversions have been largely supplanted by the orthotopic neobladder, this procedure is used when the urethra or bladder neck is non-functional or involved by tumor, and avoidance of an external appliance is desired. \"Orthotropic neobladders\"- Orthotropic neobladders are internal reservoirs that are connected to the native urethra and rely upon the external striated sphincter for continence. These reservoirs are constructed from a segment of detubularized intestine (usually ileum) anastomosed to the native urinary outflow tract. Because this approach facilitates the restoration of normal self-image by approximating normal voiding, construction of an orthotropic neobladder has become the procedure of choice for most patients following cystectomy for bladder cancer in both men and women. It is contraindicated if the urethra is nonfunctional or involved with tumor.",

It stas in the synol membrane, with the initial processes of edema, neovascularization, and hyperplasia of the synol lining. Proliferation of synoviocytes and macrophages causes thickening of the synol lining and, together with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and mast cells, develops into pannus. Pannus is a sheet of invasive cellular tissue that is continuous with the synol lining. As a result of the higher propoion of synoviocytes and macrophages, pannus causes erosion of bone and cailage at the margin of joints. In the hands, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and thumb interphalangeal (IP) joints are most frequently involved. The distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are involved only in the presence of a coexisting MCP or PIP disease. Tenosynovitis of the flexor tendons causes a reduction in finger flexion and grip strength. Nodular thickening in the tendon sheath may also produce a trigger finger. In osteoahritis and psoriatic ahritis, DIP is commonly involved.",

They represent approximately 60-70% of all parotid tumors and 90% of submandibular benign tumors. The mixture of epithelial, myoepithelial, and stromal elements is represented by the name, benign mixed tumor. Any of these individual components may predominate in the histology, but all three must be present to confirm the diagnosis. Both immunohistochemical stains specific for myoepithelial cells and epithelial cells can help to distinguish pleomorphic adenoma. Complete surgical excision of the tumor with uninvolved margins is the recommended treatment. For example, a superficial parotidectomy with clear margins is the treatment of a pleomorphic adenoma located in the superficial lobe of the parotid gland. Ref: Butt F. Y. (2012). Chapter 18.

Colostomy is still appropriate in a few patients, but the current dilemma is how to select which patients should undergo the procedure. Currently, the overall physiologic status of the patient, rather than local factors, directs decision making.

About 50% of hemangiomas of bone occur in veebrae and are most commonly situated in lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions. Other common site of involvement (20%) is skull. Small bones of hands and feets may also be affected. Haemangioma of the veebra has a typical radiographic picture in the form of loss of horizontal striations and prominence of veebral striations. There is Polka dot appearance on CT. In the skull, hemangioma generally affects the calverium and is seen as an expansile lytic lesion which has a sunburst appearance with striation radiating from the centre. A hemangioma may be identified due to associated phlebolith and it may cause local gigantism of the invovled area.

Laparotomy or thoractomy can also be done, but the videoscopic procedure is better) - major complication is gastro-esophageal reflux. - paial fundoplication is done to prevent reflux \"modified laparoscopic Heller myotomy is the operation of choice\"- Sabiston Other methods of treatment Drugs Nitrates and calcium channel bockers can be used, but are ineffective for long term use. They can be used for transient relief of symptoms and in patients unfit for surgery and pneumatic dilatation. Botulinum toxin Botulinum toxin is given by endoscopic injection into the LES. It reduces LES pressure by blocking the cholinergic excitatory nerves in the sphincter. Its effect is only sho-lived and repeated injections have to be given.

An abrasion (or a graze) is a superficial injury involving only the outer layers of the skin and not penetrating the full thickness of the epidermis. Patterned Abrasions: Patterned abrasions occur when the force is applied at or around right angle to the surface of skin. The classical example of this is seen in traffic accidents when tyre of a motor car passes over the skin leaving the pattern when the skin has been squeezed into the grooves of the rubber tread. Pressure Abrasions (Imprint Abrasions): When the impact is veical to the skin surface, the epidermis gets crushed and pressure type of abrasions result and the imprint of the impacting object may be produced.

However false negatives do occur, mainly through sampling error, and invasive cancer cannot be distinguished from 'in situ' disease. A histological specimen taken by core biopsy allows a definitive preoperative diagnosis, differentiates between duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive disease and also allows the tumor to be stained for receptor status.

Histologically it is characterized by juxtaepithelial fibrosis with atrophy or hyperplasia of the overlying epithelium which also shows areas of epithelial dysplasias. The etiology is abscure. Hypersensitivity to chilli; betel nut, tobacco and vitamin deficiencies have been implicated. The scar bands of submucous fibrosis, which result in difficulty in opening can be treated either by intralesional injection of steroids or by surgical excision and grafting, but this has little effect in preventing the onset of squamous cell Ca in the generally atrophic oral mucosa (Submucous oral fibrosis is a precancerous conditon for squamons cell Ca). \"- Bailey & Love",

WAGR syndrome (contiguous gene deletion of WT1 & PAX6 on 11. P13) It consists of Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary abnormalities (cryptorchidism, streak ovaries, bicornuate uterus, ambiguous genitalia), and Mental retardation. Patients with this syndrome have a constitutional deletion of chromosome 11p13 where the Wilms tumor gene, WT1, and the aniridia gene, PAX6, are located. Denys- Drash syndrome(missense mutation in WT1 gene) It is characterized by Male pseudohermaphrodism, Early-onset renal failure characterized by mesangial sclerosis and Increased risk of Wilms tumor. Patients with this syndrome typically carry a missense mutation in the WT1 gene. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (WT2 gene abnormality on chromosome 11. P15. 5) It is characterized by Hemihypertrophy, Macroglossia, Visceromegaly, Omphalocele Risk of developing Wilms tumor (3-5%) A variety of 11p15. 5 abnormalities have been reported in patients with this syndrome, and it is postulated that a second Wilms tumor gene, WT2, is located in this region. Loss of imprinting of the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene, an epigenetic process, also is associated with Wilms tumor.
