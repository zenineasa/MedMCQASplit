Patients on parenteral hyperalimentation with extensive bums, sepsis, major operations, multiple trauma or prolonged illness with multiple organ system failure are at risk for developing acalculous cholecystitis.Harrison writes * \"An increased risk for the development of acalculous cholecystitis is especially associated with serious trauma or bums, with the postpartum period following prolonged labor, and with orthopedic and other nonbiliary major surgical operations in the post operative period. It may possibly complicate periods of prolonged parenteral hyperalimentation. For some of these cases, biliary sludge in the cystic duct may be responsible. Other precipitating factors includevasculitis obstructing adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder diabetes mellitus torsion of the gall bladderunusual bacterial infections of the gall bladder (eg. Leptospira, Streptococcus, Salmonella, or Vibrio cholera), and parasitic infestation of gallbladder.* Acalculous cholecystitis may also be seen with a variety of other systemic disease processes sarcoidosis - syphilis cardiovascular disease - actinomycosistuberculosisClinical manifestation is indistinguishable from those of calculous cholecystitis, however, the setting of cholecystitis in severe underlying illness is characteristic of acalculous cholecystitis.U/S & CT examinations show a large, tense, static gallbladder without stones and with evidence of poor emptying over a prolonged period. Ultrasonography is usually the diagnostic test of choice, as it can be done bedside in the intensive care unit.ManagementThe complication rate of acalculous cholecystitis is more than calculous cholecystitis.Acalculous cholecystitis requires urgent intervention.Percutaneous ultrasound or CT guided cholecystostomy is the treatment of choice for these patients, as they are unfit for surgery.If the diagnosis is uncertain, percutaneous cholecystostomy is both diagnostic and therapeutic. About 90% of patients will improve with the percutaneous cholecystostomy. However, if they do not improve, other steps, such as open cholecystostomy or cholecystectomy, may be required.If needed cholecystectomy can be done after the patient has recovered from the underlying disease.",

It is made soluble by bile acids and phospholipid - lecithin which form micelles with cholesterolo So any mechanism which increases the cholesterol in bile or decreases the bile acids (salts) or lecithin makes the bile supersaturated or lithogenic. If to such a bile, the other two elements i.e. nucleation and stasis are provided, the cholesterol in solution precipitates to form cholesterol crystals which grow to form cholesterol stones,o Factors which increase biliary cholesterolObesityHigh calorie and cholesterol rich dietClofibrate therapyo Factors which decrease bile acidsPrimary biliary cirrhosisOral contraceptive pillsGenetic factorsA mutation in CYP7A1 gene which results in deficiency1 of enzyme cholesterol 7 -hydroxylase. It results in impaired hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, thus it increases the cholesterol/bile acid ratio.Decreased/impaired enterohepatic circulation of bile acids:Ileal diseaseIleal resectionCholestyramine, colestipol (bile acid sequestrants) therapy.Deoxycholateo Factors which decrease biliary lecithin- A mutation in MDR3 gene leads to defective phospholipid (lecithin) secretion into bile.Nucleationo Nucleation refers to the process by wrhich cholesterol monohydrate crystals form and agglomerate to become macroscopic crystals.o Formation of cholesterol stones requires either an excess of pronucleating factors or a deficiency of antinucleating factors.o Mucin and certain non-mucin glycoproteins (and infection according to Bailey & Love) appear to be pronucleating factors, while apolipoproteins AI and All and certain other glycoproteins appear to be antinucleating factor.C) Stasis or gall bladder hypomotilityo Stones would not be able to form if the gall bladder emptied all supersaturated or crystal containing bile completely.o Gall bladder hypomotility is caused byProlonged parenteral nutritionFastingPregnancyDrugs such as octreotideOral contraceptive pillsSurgery, bums",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., CBD stones o Most common surgical cause of obstructive jaundice is choledocholithiasiso Stone disease is the most common cause of obstructive jaundice. Gallstones may pass through the CBD and cause obstruction and symptoms of biliary colic and cholecystitis. Larger stones can become lodged in the CBD and cause complete obstruction, with increased intraductal pressure throughout the biliary tree. Mirizzi syndrome is the presence of a stone impacted in the cystic duct or the gallbladder neck, causing inflammation and external compression of the common hepatic duct and thus biliary obstruction.",
