        "exp": "Ans. (a) Achalasia Cardia* Achalasia is a rare disease caused by loss of inhibitory ganglion cells within the esophageal myenteric plexus* It leads to a hypertensive lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) which fails to relax on swallowing, and by aperistalsis of the body of the oesophagus.* Long-standing achalasia is characterized by progressive dilatation and sigmoid deformity of the esophagus with hypertrophy of the LES. Clinical Presentation* Progressive dysphagia is the most common presenting symptom. It generally concerns initially liquids and later both liquids and solids from the outset.# Dysphagia: Liquids > Solid* The second most common symptom is the regurgitation of undigested food during or shortly after a meal. Investigation* Screening: Barium study- Bird beak appearance* IOC: Manometry. Treatment* Medical management:# Calcium channel blockers# Nitrates# Botulinum toxin (injected into the LES under endoscopic guidance)* Surgical management:# Harrison states: \"The only durable therapies for achalasia are pneumatic dilatation and Heller myotomy\"# Surgery of choice: Heller's myotomy",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Achalasia cardia Treatment of Achalasiao The aim of treatment is to be relieve the functional obstruction at the cardiao The two main methods to achieve this are: 1. Forceful dilatation or2. Esophageal myotomy (Heller's myotomy) with or without an antireflux procedure. 1). Forceful dilatation (pneumatic dilatation). The aim is to weaken or rupture the circular muscle fibres of the LES by forceful stretch. Perforation and bleeding are potential complications. 2). Extram ucosal cardiomyotomy (Heller \\ myotomy). This involves surgical division of the muscle fibres of the lower esophageal sphincter. This procedure can be performed through a laparoscopic or thoracoscopic approach (Open surgical procedure i. e. Laparotomy or thoractomy can also be done, but the videoscopic procedure is better). Major complication is gastro-esophageal reflux. Partial fundoplication is done to prevent reflux. ''Modified laparoscopic Heller myotomy is the operation of choice \" ____Sabiston. Other methods of treatment. Drugso Nitrates and calcium channel bockers can be used, but are ineffective for long term use. They can be used for transient relief of symptoms, o Botulinum toxino Botulinum toxin is given by endoscopic injection into the LES. It reduces LES pressure by blocking the cholinergic excitatory nerves in the sphinctero Its effect is only short-lived and repeated injections have to be give. o Used only in patients unfit for surgery and pneumatic dilatation.",

Presenting symptoms include dysphagia associated with the spontaneous regurgitation of undigested, bland material, after interrupting eating or drinking. The dysphagia is occasional when the diverticula gets filled with food. Dysphagia is relieved when the diver- ticulum empties. Other symptoms are. Halitosis (foul mouth odour) gurgling noise after eating swelling in the neck aspiration of contents leading to recurrent pneumonia, lung abscess. Diagnosis is confirmed by barium swallow. In Achalasia & Ca esophagus, the dysphagia is progressive and not occasional, though regurgitation may be seen in achalasia.
