This venous plexus surrounds the vertebrae and extends from the base of the skull to the sacrum. Venous channels exist between this plexus and veins associated with thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic organs. These vessels provide a route for metastatis emboli to reach the skull, vertebrae, ribs, pelvic bones, and central nervous systemo Metastasis of breast cancer to bone, and especially to thoracic vertebrae, is common due to the direct connection between the intercostal veins draining the breast and the internal vertebral plexus also known as Batson's plexus.

This makes it more difficult to treat since most chemotherapies target one of the three receptors, so triple-negative cancers often require combination therapies. Triple negative is sometimes used as a surrogate term for basal-like; however, more detailed classification may provide better guidance for treatment and better estimates for prognosis.o Triple-negative breast cancers comprise a very heterogeneous group of cancers. There are conflicting information over prognosis for the various subtypes but it appears that the Nottingham prognostic index is valid and hence general prognosis is rather similar with other breast cancer of same stage, except that more aggressive treatment is required. Some types of triple-negative breast cancer are known to be more aggressive with poor prognosis, while other types have very similar or better prognosis than hormone receptor positive breast cancers. Pooled data of all triple-negative subtypes suggest that with optimal treatment 20-year survival rates are very close to those of hormone positive cancer.o Triple-negative breast cancers have a relapse pattern that is very different from hormone-positive breast cancers: the risk of relapse is much higher for the first 3-5 years but drops sharply and substantially below that of hormonepositive breast cancers after that. This relapse pattern has been recognized for all types of triple-negative cancers for which sufficient data exists although the absolute relapse and survival rates differ across subtypes",
