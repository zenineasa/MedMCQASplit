Ref: Journal of Continuing Medical Education of Radiology, Annals of Oncology; Vol. 15, Issue 3\"Metastases to the heart and pericardium are much more common than primary cardiac tumors and are generally associated with a poor prognosis. Tumours that are most likely to involve the heart and pericardium include cancers of the lung and breast, melanoma, and lymphoma. Tumour may involve the heart and pericardium by one of four pathways: retrograde lymphatic extension, hematogenous spread, direct contiguous extension, or transvenous extension. \"\"In principle, every malignant tumour can metastasize to the heart. To date, only tumours of the central nervous system have not been proven to develop cardiac metastases. The most common tumours with cardiac metastatic potential are carcinomas of the lung, the breast and the esophagus, malignant lymphoma, leukemia, and malignant melanoma\"\"Carcinoma of the breast, lung, oesophagus, pancreas, malignant melanoma, and malignant lymphoma are mentioned most frequently in the literature as the primary tumor. In fact, almost all types of tumors have occasionally metastasized to the heart. \"Ca urinary bladder- vascular spread is most commonly to bone, particularly axial skeleton although liver and lung metastasis do occur, usually at a very late stage.

This venous plexus surrounds the vertebrae and extends from the base of the skull to the sacrum. Venous channels exist between this plexus and veins associated with thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic organs. These vessels provide a route for metastatis emboli to reach the skull, vertebrae, ribs, pelvic bones, and central nervous systemo Metastasis of breast cancer to bone, and especially to thoracic vertebrae, is common due to the direct connection between the intercostal veins draining the breast and the internal vertebral plexus also known as Batson's plexus.
