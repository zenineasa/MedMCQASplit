        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Fever. REF: Smith urology 17th ed page 206. Acute cystitis refers to urinary infection of the lower urinary tract, principally the bladder. Acute cystitis more commonly affects women than men. Patients with acute cystitis present with irritative voiding symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, Nocturia and urgency, Low back and suprapubic pain, hematuria, and doudy/foul smelling urine are also common symptoms. Fever and systemic symptoms are rare. Urinalysis demonstrates WBCs in the urine, and hematuria may be present. Urine culture is required to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative organism. However, when the clinical picture and urinalysis are highly suggestive of the diagnosis of acute cystitis, urine culture may not be needed. E. coli causes most of the acute cystitis. Other gram-negative (Klebsiella and Proteus spp.) and gram-positive (S. saprophyticus and enterococci) bacteria are uncommon pathogens. Diabetes and lifetime history of UTI are risk factors for acute cystitis. In general, those in whom acute cystitis developed do not usually require any extensive radiologic investigation (such as a voiding cystourethrogram), but those in whom pyelonephritis developed do.

Gradually these tubercles enlarge and may ulcerate (but do not cause bladder perforation). o These tubercles lend 'cobblestone* appearance on cystoscopy. o There is considerable submucous fibrosis which causes diminished capacity of bladder. Scarred & fibrosed, small capacity bladder is b'a thimble bladder. o The fibrosis which usually starts around the ureter, contracts to cause a pull at the ureters. This either leads to a stricture or displaced, dilated and rigid wide mouthed ureter k/a golf hole ureters, this almost always leads to ureteral reflux.",
