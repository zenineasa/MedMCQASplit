        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Tuberculosis o Bladder tuberculosis is almost always secondaryto renal tuberculosiso The disease starts at the ureteric opening, the earliest evidence being pallor of the mucosa due to submucosal edema. o Subsequently tiny white transluscent tubercles develop all over. Gradually these tubercles enlarge and may ulcerate (but do not cause bladder perforation). o These tubercles lend 'cobblestone* appearance on cystoscopy. o There is considerable submucous fibrosis which causes diminished capacity of bladder. Scarred & fibrosed, small capacity bladder is b'a thimble bladder. o The fibrosis which usually starts around the ureter, contracts to cause a pull at the ureters. This either leads to a stricture or displaced, dilated and rigid wide mouthed ureter k/a golf hole ureters, this almost always leads to ureteral reflux.",
