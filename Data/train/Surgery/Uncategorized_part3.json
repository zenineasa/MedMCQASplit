        "exp": "Ans. D: USG Laboratory Studies The results of routine laboratory blood work are nonspecific. Liver involvement may be reflected in an elevated bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase level. Leukocytosis may suggest infection of the cyst. Eosinophilia is present in 25% of all persons who are infected, while hypogammaglobinemia is present in 30%. Almost every serodiagnostic technique has been evaluated for echinococcosis, with variable results. - The indirect hemagglutination test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have a sensitivity of 80% overall (90% in hepatic echinococcosis, 40% in pulmonary echinococcosis) and are the initial screening tests of choice. - Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis demonstrate antibodies to antigen 5 and provide specific confirmation of reactivity. - The ELISA test is useful in follow-up to detect recurrence. Imaging Studies - Plain films Findings from plain films of the chest, abdomen, or any other involved site are, at best, nonspecific and mostly nonrevealing. A thin rim of calcification delineating a cyst is suggestive of an echinococcal cyst. - Ultrasound Ultrasonography helps in the diagnosis of hydatid cysts when the daughter cysts and hydatid sand are demonstrated. The accuracy of ultrasound evaluations remains operator-dependent. CT scan CT scan has an accuracy of 98% and the sensitivity to demonstrate the daughter cysts. It is the best test for the differentiation of hydatid from amebic and pyogenic cysts in the liver. - MRI: Images show the cysts adequately, but MRI offers no real advantage over CT scan. Other Tests - Casoni test Historically, an intradermal skin test (Casoni test) was used and had a sensitivity of 70%. It is now largely abandoned because of its low sensitivity, low accuracy, and potential for severe local allergic reaction.",

Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium that can inhabit various areas of the stomach and duodenum. It causes a chronic low-level inflammation of the stomach lining and is strongly linked to the development of duodenal and gastric ulcers and stomach cancer. Over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic. The most reliable method for detecting H. pylori infection is a biopsy check during endoscopy with a rapid urease test, histological examination, and microbial culture.

The incidence increases in Oriental groups (1: 500) and decreases in the black population (1: 2000). The highest incidence reported for cleft lip and palate occurs in the Indian tribes of Montana, USA (1: 276). Although cleft lip and palate is an extremely diverse and variable congenital abnormality, several distinct subgroups exist, namely cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P), cleft palate (CP) alone and submucous cleft palate (SMCP). The typical distribution of cleft types is: Cleft lip alone: 15%; Cleft lip and palate: 45%; Isolated cleft palate: 40%. Cleft lip/palate predominates in males, whereas cleft palate alone appears to be more common in females. In unilateral cleft lip the deformity affects the left side in 60% of cases.

Ulnar nerve palsy result in loss of fine intrinsic motions of hand. It result in an abduction deformity of the little finger from paralysis of the interossei, interosseous muscle wasting, and paial claw hand from interphalangeal flexion deformities of the ring and little fingers. Radial nerve injury result in wrist drop. Axillary or proximal injury result in triceps weakness in addition to wrist drop.

CO2) can be ignored because negligible amounts are present at physiologic pH, leaving the equilibrium: CO2 + H2O H+ + HCO3- The leftward shift to replenish exhaled CO2 decreases the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration and increases the pH (- log10) to produce alkalosis (blood pH above the physiologic norm of 7. 4).

This type of ureterocele is also termed ohotopic, since it arises from a ureter with a normal inseion into the trigone. An intravesical ureterocele results from the prolapse of the mucosa of the terminal segment of the ureter through the ureterovesical orifice into the bladder. This prolapsed ureteral mucosa carries with it a poion of the continuous sheet of the bladder mucosa around the orifice. The prolapsed segment thus has a wall that consists of a thin layer of muscle and collagen interposed between the bladder uroepithelium and the ureter uroepithelium. Since the terminal ureteral orifice is usually narrowed and paially obstructed, and since there is no muscle suppo for the double mucosal walls of the prolapsed segment, it dilates. This dilated segment fills with urine and protrudes into the bladder. On excretory urography, cobra head sign is classically seen with an intravesical ureterocele.",

Approximately 5 to 25 % of children have pathological lead points (percentages vary from book to book). \"The most common pathologic lead point is a Meckel's diveiculum followed by polyps and duplications. Other benign lead points are the appendix, hemangiomas, carcinoid tumors, foreign bodies, ectopic pancreas or gastric mucosa, hamaomas from Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and lipomas. Malignant causes, which are very rare, include lymphomas, lymphosarcomas, small bowel tumors, and melanomas. \" - Ashcraft's Pediatric Surgery, Fifth edition George Whitfield Holcomb, J.

LES comprises the lower 4 cm of esophagus, where resting pressure within the lumen normally exceeds the intragastric pressure. This high intraluminal pressure at LES prevents the GE reflux. The LES is a physiological entity rather than any anatomical structure Several factors contribute to the high intraluminal pressure of LES a) Intrinsic musculature of distal esophagus these muscle fibres differ from those in other areas of the esophagus in that they are in a state of tonic contraction. They normally relax with initiation of a swallow and then return to a state of tonic contraction. Sling fibres of the cardia Crura of the diaphragm Intraabdominal pressure - the intraabdominal pressure compresses the intraabdominal segment of esophagus (ie LES) and is probably the most important factor in preventing the reflux. - CSDT writes - \"Sphincter competance is a function of sphincter pressure, sphincter length and the length exposed to intraabdominal pressure\". - In cases of sliding hernia the gastroesophageal junction shifts to posterior mediastinum. The LES is then exposed to the low intrathoracic pressure instead of the high intraabdominal pressure. The low intrathoracic pressure is unable to prevent the reflux in sliding hernia. Other factors apart from LES which prevent the reflux The gastroesophageal angle - the oblique entry of esophagus has a valvular effect, in that it closes the esophagus when the gastric fundus distends The folds of mucosa at the cardia helps in closing the LES when intragastric pressure rises. The intrathoracic pressure has no role in preventing reflux. It's too low (ranging from -5 to +5 mm of Hg).",

        "exp": "PSVT [Ref: Harrison 17/e p. 1431, 1427, 1426, 14351 Sinus tachycardia Sinus tachycardia occurs when SA node discharges at a rate faster than 100 beats/minute. Sinus tachycardia represents a normal or appropriate response to a physiological stress such as that occurs with exercise, anxiety or fever. It is impoant to distinguish sinus tachycardia from other SVT's. - Sinus tachycardia will produce a Pwave contour consistent with its origin from the sinus node. - Sinus tachycardia is in absence of complicating conduction disturbance is characterized by normal P-QRS-T complexes which are recorded in rapid succession. Onset of sinus tachycardia is gradual. - Sinus tachycardia is the normal physiological response to exercise and emotions. A sinus tachycardia that persists at rest is usually an expression of some underlying disorder. Atrial flutter In atrial flutter the impulse originates. from a single. focus in the atria. Classical or typical atrial flutter has an atrial rate of about 300 heats/minute. The ventricular response to this rapid atrial activity depends upon the efficacy of A-V conduction. - Occasionally every atrial impulse is conducted to the ventricle i. e., a 1: 1 response resulting in very. fast ventricular rate. - More commonly second degree A-V block is present resulting in a relatively slow ventricular rate. The Atrial flutter commonly present in with a ventricular response that tends to be 2: 1 or typically 130-150 beats/minute. - This means that every second atrial beat gets through the A-V node. - Because the ration of P to QRS is usually consistent atrial flutter is often regular. So atrial flutter commonly present as fixed 2: 1 A-V block with a regular heart rate that is 150-200 b/rm These are spontaneously occurring and sporadic paroxysmal episodes of regular rapid heart rate of 150-250 beats/minute. Theoretically it refers to any tachycardia that is not ventricular in origin. In the widest sense SVT may include abnormal sinus tachycardia, ectopic atrial tachycardia (that is not from sinoatrial node), Atrial. fibrillation1flutter and junctional tachycardial. Often, however, in clinical setting, it is used practically as a synonym for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Supraventricular tachycardia develops and ends abruptly and during the episode the heart rate is b/w 150-250 and is regular. - Symptoms in PSVT may sta and stop suddenly often in response to quick movement such as picking up something from the floor. Because physiological sinus tachycardia has a gradual onset and atrial fibrillation is irregular they are excluded from the PSVT category. PSVT are most commonly AV nodal reentrant tachycardia or pa of WPW syndrome. Idioventricular rhvthum In idioventricular tachycardia an ectopic, focus in the ventricle is enhanced and it exceeds or equals the sinus rate. The heart rate in idioventricular rhythm is in the rage of 70- 80b/minute. Sinus tachycardia can be ruled out as it has slow onset. In idioventricular tachycardia the heart rate is usually 70-80 beats/minute. So we are left with I'SVT and Atrial flutter with block. - Atrial flutter has an atrial rate of 250-300 beat/minute and the heart rate is irregular but it is usually associated with fixed 2: 1 block so the heart rate drops to 150 b/m and the rate becomes regular. - So both PSVT and Atrial flutter can have regular heart rate of 150 b/m. - Both have sudden onset. There is nothing much to differentiate b/w supraventricular tachycardia and Atrial fibrillation. Supraventicrucular tachycardia seems to be the correct option because it is quite rare. for a normal person to develop atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation usually develops in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. The question does not give any information regarding this, so it can be assumed that he is a normal healthy person. Sudden palpitation in a normal healthy person is most likely due to supraventricular tachycardia.",

The patient described above has colonic carcinoma, and the \"apple core\" lesion is the classic radiographic finding of this tumor. Although CEA is not used for screening because of the large number of false positives, it can be used to guide treatment in known cases. It returns to normal levels 30-45 days after tumor resection. If it begins to rise again, tumor recurrence is likely. AFP, or alpha-fetoprotein, is an alpha globulin (70, 000 daltons) made by the liver and yolk sac of the human fetus. It is elevated with hepatocellular carcinoma and germ cell neoplasms. It is not paicularly specific. h.

        "exp": "Ans is 'b' i. e. CD 117 Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the GI tract and are most frequently located in the stomach (60%-70%). In 1983, Mazur and Clark coined the term GIST to indicate a distinctive subgroup of GI mesenchymal tumor, which could be classified neither as neurogenic nor as smooth muscle derived tumor. Historically, they were presumed to have smooth muscle origin and classified as leiomyomas, leiomyoblastomas, and leiomyosarcoma. They are considered to originated from the interstitial cell of Cajal, an intestinal pacemaker cells. Almost all GISTs (and almost no smooth muscle tumors) express c-KIT (CD117) or the related PDGFRA, as well as CD34. Kit is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, the ligand for which is stem cell factor. The Kit protein is detected by immunohistochemistry and can reliably distinguish GISTs from true smooth muscle neoplasms. (Note that almost all smooth muscle tumors (and almost no GISTs) express actin and desmin. KIT is used not only for diagnosis but also for targeted therapy of GISTs. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is widely used in the treatment of advanced and metastatic GISTs and has been recently employed in the neo adjuvant and adjuvant set-up with encouraging results. Surgical resection of the localized GIST is the mainstay therapy, as a resection of tumor renders only a chance of cure. The primary goal of surgery is complete resection of the disease with negative margins. GISTs are resistant to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore until the advent of Imatinib, there was no effective treatment available for the unresectable or metastatic GISTs. The development of Imatinib mesylate has revolutionized the management of this disease. Imatinib mesylate (formerly referred to as STI 571, Gleevec. TM) is a 2-phenylpyrimidine derivative that blocks binding of ATP to ABL tyrosine kinases including c-Kit, c-ABL, bcr-ABL, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRA). Imatinib was developed as a PDGFR inhibitor. The efficacy of Imatinib mesylate as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor was first assessed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is associated with mutation in bcr. ABL tyrosine kinase similar to the role of KIT in GIST. Prognosis in patients with GIST tumors depends mostly on tumor size and mitotic count, and metastasis. GISTs metastasize through hematogenous route. Usual sites are infra-abdominal, either to the liver, omentum, or peritoneal cavity. (Ref: Devita's Oncology 8/e).",

The most common mechanism of an ankle sprain is a combination of plantarflexion and inversion where the foot is pointing downward and inward. The lateral ligaments are involved in an inversion ankle sprain and hence most commonly damaged. These ligaments are on the outside of the ankle, which includes the anterior talofibular (ATFL), calcaneofibular (CFL) and posterior talofibular ligaments (PTFL).

The backflow of these digestive juices causes lysis (dissolving) of pancreatic cells and subsequent pancreatitis. E - ethanol (alcohol) T - trauma S - steroids M - mumps (paramyxovirus) and other viruses (Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus) A - autoimmune disease (Polyaeritis nodosa, Systemic lupus erythematosus) S - scorpion sting (e. g. Tityus trinitatis), and also snake bites H - hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia/hyperiglyceridemia and hypothermia E - ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography) D - drugs (SAND - steroids and sulfonamides, azathioprine, NSAIDS, diuretics such as furosemide and thiazides, and didanosine) and duodenal ulcers.

Symptoms of Bladder outlet obstruction and back pains (due to bony metastasis in the pelvis & lumbar vertebra) indicate towards prostate Ca. Serum acid phosphates is a tumor marker of prostate Ca. But now serum acid phosphates assay has been superseded by PSA assay (Prostate specific antigen). Prostate-specific antigen It is a glycoprotein produced only in the prostatic cells (both benign & malignant). It facilitates liquefaction of semen. It is neither sensitive nor specific for early prostate carcinoma (it is prostate specific and not prostate cancer specific), nevertheless it gives some help in making a diagnosis. Normal serum level -> less than 4 mg/ml 4 - 10 mg/ml -> this range is common for both BHP and Ca. More than 10 mg/ml -> approx 75% will have cancer. Since PSA is not specific for Ca, PSA Velocity & PSA density is used to detect Prostate cancer. PSA velocity is the rate of change in PSA levels over time and is expressed most commonly as the PSA doubling time. For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than. 75 mg/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0. 5 mg/ml, per year should be used to advise biopsy. PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level. Values < 0. 10 are consistent with BPH. > 0. 15 suggest cancer",

Then a mixture of dead space air plus alveolar air comes out.

The CO2 concentration in the last 10m1. of tidal volume is known as end tidal CO2 In pulmonary embolism the blood supply to ceain pas of the lung is cut off due to the emboli in circulation. This reduces the exchange of gases between the alveoli and pulmonary capillaries, as a result the conc. of CO2 in alveolar air decreases (CO2 is carried from tissues to the lung by blood and is transferred to the alveoli in exchange of 02). The decrease in alveolar CO2 will lead to decrease in end tidal CO2. Other conditions in which end tidal CO decreases (i) Increase in dead space (decrease in end tidal CO2 in pulmonary embolism can be explained by this also.

Saline cannot be used because electrolytes in the irrigation fluid will dissipate the electric current used to resect the prostate. \" - Schwaz 8/e p1530 (not given in 9/e) During transurethral resection of prostate strips of tissue are cut from the bladder neck down to the level of veru mon tan um. This cutting is performed by a loop mounted on the hand held trigger of the resectoscope in which Diathermy current is being passed. We all know that normal saline is a very good conductor of electricity (as it contain ions - Na+ & CI ions). So if it is used while performing TURF, the diathermy current used in the procedure will cause electrolyte diassociation of normal saline and the current will not be localized in the loop and hence cutting of the tissue will not be proper. You can put up a question that the same can occur with the use of distilled water too. Distilled water can also conduct electricity-but the current used during TURP is not very strong and distilled water is not as good conductor of electricity as Normal saline. (You must be aware that distilled water is a worse conductor of electricity than normal water.) There were also arguments that distilled water causes fluid overload and therefore should not be used in TURP. True, distilled water causes fluid overload or TURP syndrome but this complication is not common Distilled water is being replaced by 1. 5% glycine but still can be used for TURP (and is used in many centres when glycine is not available) Do not get confused by what is written in Bailey 241\" /e p. 1377, 1378 (23/e, p1245, 1246) - If you go through it carefully, you will find that Bailey states that normal saline is used after the operation i. e. it is used for post operative irrigation.",

Clinical manifestations Cough, fever, cyanosis and respiratory distress followed by initial improvement may be the initial signs of bronchiolitis obliterans. Progression of the disease may ensue with increasing dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and wheezing. Chest radiographs may be relatively normal compared with the extent of physical findings but may demonstrate hyperluscency and patchy infiltrates (occasionally, a sayer James syndrome, i. e. a unilateral hyperluscent lung has developed). Pulmonary function tests demonstrate variable findings but typically show signs of airway obstruction. Ventilation perfusion scan shows a typical motheaten appearance of multiple matched defects in ventilation and perfusion. CT scan demonstrates patchy areas of hyperluscency. Open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy remains the best means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment No definite therapy exists for bronchiolitis obliterans. Administration of coicosteroids may be beneficial About other options Follicular bronchitis It is a lymphoproliferative lung disorder characterized the presence of lymphoid follicles, coursing along the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) It is rare in children. Although the cause is unknown, an infectious aetiology has been proposed. Onset of symptoms generally occurs by 6 weeks of age and peaks between 6 and 18 months. Cough, moderate fever and fine crackles are common clinical findings. Fine crackles generally, persist over time and recurrence of symptoms is common. Chest radiographs may be relatively benign initially but evolve into the typical interstitial pattern. Pulmonary function tests show restrictive pattern Chest CT shows fine reticular pattern. Open lung biopsy is used to make definitive diagnosis. Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis This is a rare disorder. Although the underlying cause of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is unknown, the disease is characterized by the formation of lamellar concretions of calcium phosphate or \"microlith\". within the alveoli, creating a classic pattern on the radiograph. Chest radiography typically reveal bilateral infiltrates with afine sandlike micronodular appearance. Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is in the mid 30s the onset of the disease can occur during childhood. When symptomatic, individuals with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis usually complain of dyspnoea on exeion and non productive cough. Physical examinations of the lungs may reveal fine inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds. Clubbing occurs, although this is usually a more advanced sign. Children are often asymptomatic on initial presentation. Diagnosis Chest radiography typically reveals b/L infiltrate with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance or \"Sandstorm\" appearance. CT scan shows diffuse micronodular calcified densities. Open lung biopsy reveals laminated calcific ioncretions within the alceoli.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Umbilicus Sister Mary Joseph nodule/node/ Sister Mary Joseph sign, refers to a palpable nodule bulging into the umbilicus as a result of metastasis of a malignant cancer in the pelvis or abdomen. Gastrointestinal malignancies account for about half of underlying sources (most commonly gastric cancer, colonic cancer or pancreatic cancer, mostly of the tail and body of the pancreas), and men are even more likely to have an underlying cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. Gynecological cancers account for about 1 in 4 cases (primarily ovarian cancer and also uterine cancer). Unknown primary tumors and rarely, urinary or respiratory tract malignancies cause umbilical metastases. Proposed mechanisms for the spread of cancer cells to the umbilicus include direct transperitoneal spread, the lymphatics which run alongside the obliterated umbilical vein, hematogenous spread, or remnant structures such as the falciform ligament, median umbilical ligament, or a remnant of the vitelline duct. Sister Joseph nodule is associated with multiple peritoneal metastases and a poor prognosis. Virchow's node (or signal node) is an enlarged, hard, left supraclavicular lymph node which can contain metastasis of visceral (abdominal) malignancy.",

Rapid exposure of these vessels can be accomplished during abdominal trauma by following maneuvers: - The principle behind visceral rotation is to rotate the viscera of one side towards the midline after freeing their lateral peritoneal attachments so as to expose the vessels of that side A left medial visceral rotation (Mattox maneuver) provides excellent exposure of the aoa, coeliac axis, superior mesentric aery, left renal aery and iliac aeries.

The infrarenal aoa may be approached a transperitoneal incision at the base of the mesocolon.

        "exp": "According to Harrison's 18th ed Types II, III, and IV hiatal hernias are all subtypes of paraesophageal hernia in which the herniation into the mediastinum includes a visceral structure other than the gastric cardia. In type II the gastro esophageal junction remains fixed. With type IV hiatal hernias, viscera other than the stomach herniate into the mediastinum, most commonly the colon. Both Harrison and sabiston state that large hiatal hernias can occur in type III, however they don't mention the term giant. According to \"THE ESOPHAGUS BY JOEL. RITCHER\" and \"FUNDAMENTALS OF SURGICAL PRACTICE BY ANDREW'S KINGSNOH\" A giant hiatal hernia is usually a paraesophageal hernia of type III or IV in which more than 50% of the abdominal organ (stomach) has crossed the hiatal defect and causes symptom.",

The lower thoracic and upper lumbar veebrae are the areas of the spine most often affected. Pott's disease results from haematogenous spread of tuberculosis from other sites, often pulmonary. The infection then spreads from two adjacent veebrae into the adjoining disc space. If only one veebra is affected, the disc is normal, but if two are involved the interveebral disc, which is avascular, cannot receive nutrients and collapses (seen as narrowing of interveebral space on X-rays) The disease progresses slowly. Signs and symptoms include: Localised back pain is the earliest and commonest complaint Paraveebral swelling may be seen Neurological signs may occur, leading to paraplegia. Stiffness Deformity Constitutional symptoms Spinal X-ray may not show early disease as 50% of bone mass must be lost for changes to be visible on x-ray. However, plain radiographs can show veebral destruction and narrowed disc space. MRI is useful to demonstrate the extent of spinal compression and can show changes at an earlier stage than plain radiographs. Bone elements visible within the swelling, or abscesses, are strongly indicative of Pott's disease as opposed to malignancy. CT scans and nuclear bone scans can also be used.",

The process is completed by the twelfth week of gestation, but the migration from the midtransverse colon to anus takes 4 weeks. During this latter period, the fetus is most vulnerable to defects in the migration of neural crest cells. This may explain why most cases of aganglionosis involve the rectum and rectosigmoid.

It is the result of an increased body pool of urate with hyperuricemia. It is typically characterized by episodic acute and chronic ahritis, due to deposition of Monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joints and connective tissue tophi, and the risk for deposition in kidney interstitium or uric acid nephrolithiasis. If the clinical appearance strongly suggests gout, the diagnosis should be confirmed by needle aspiration of acutely or chronically involved joints or tophaceous deposits. Acute septic ahritis, several of the other crystalline-associated ahropathies, palindromic rheumatism, and psoriatic ahritis may present with similar clinical features. During acute gouty attacks, strongly birefringent needle-shaped MSU crystals with negative elongation are typically seen both intracellularly and extracellularly.

He called these powerful internal forces that oppose change resistance. Resistance takes place at any point in the treatment and paicularly when unacceptable impulses or thoughts threaten to come into consciousness or a maladaptive defense mechanism is challenged. Resistance can manifest itself in many different ways, including withholding impoant thoughts from the analyst, falling silent during sessions, forgetting appointments, forgetting to pay the analyst, falling asleep during session, and considering dropping out of treatment. The possible manifestations of resistance are countless and depend on the patient's defense mechanisms and personality. In other words, the patient's intrapsychic defenses manifest as resistance in the context of his or her interpersonal relationship with the analyst. Freud thought that resistance should be uncovered by the analyst but not challenged or interpreted. Modern analysts believe that resistance should be analyzed through the patient's free associations suppoed by the analyst's observations.",

Sarcoidosis is associated with ectopic and unregulated synthesis of calcitriol by steroid tissue in response to sunlight or ingestion of vitamin D.

Activity of I a hydroxylase enzyme is under negative feedback control in normal tissues. - However, in granulomatous disorder normal feed hack inhibition is abolished, probably by the effects of interferon gamma. - Interferon gamma induces the activity of la hydroxylase this leads to increased production of calcitriol (1, 25 hydroxyvitamin D). - Increased production of calcitriol causes augumented intestinal absorption of calcium.

Abdominal Aoic Aneurysms Abdominal aoic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common true aerial aneurysm. An aoic aneurysm is defined as a focal dilation of the aoa with a diameter of at least 1. 5 times that of the expected normal diameter of that given aoic segment; in the AA, enlargement of the aoic diameter of more than 3 cm is usually considered aneurysmal. Most common site is infrarenal. More common in males than females. Incidence increases with age. At least 90% of all abdominal aoic aneurysms >4. 0 cm are related to atherosclerotic disease. Prognosis is related to both the size of the aneurysm and the severity of coexisting coronary aery and 3 cerebrovascular disease. The risk of rupture is directly related to the size of aneurysm. An abdominal aoic aneurysm is usually asymptomatic. They are usually detected incidentally on routine clinical examinations or investigation performed for some other reasons. As abdominal aoic aneurysms expand, however, they may become painful. Aneurysmal pain is usually a harbinger of rupture and represents a medical emergency. More often, acute rupture occurs without any prior warning, and this complication is always life-threatening. Contrast-enhanced CT is investigation of choice. MRI is as sensitive and specific as CECT and is used if use of contrast is precluded. Ultrasound is the screening study of choice and is useful for serial documentation of aneurysm size Operative repair of the aneurysm with inseion of a prosthetic graft or endovascular placement of an aoic stent graft is indicated for: - abdominal aoic aneurysms of any size that are expanding rapidly or are associated with symptoms. - for asymptomatic aneurysms, abdominal aoic aneurysm repair is indicated if the diameter is >5. 5 cm. The decision to perform an open surgical operation or endovascular repair is based in pa on the vascular anatomy and comorbid conditions. Endovascular repair of abdominal aoic aneurysms has a lower sho-term morbidity rate but a comparable long-term moality rate with open surgical reconstruction. (Harrison 18/e) In Elective surgery of abdominal aoic aneurysm the operative moality, rate approximates 1 to 2% whereas after acute rupture the moality rate of emergency operation generally exceeds 50%.",

This constraint applies with in the coex, where the physical lack of space for new bone necessitates preceding resorption, and it also seems to apply to periosteal and endosteal sutfaces(2 * There is, however, debate as to whether periosteal accretion can occur in adults without preceding bone resorption. There are two definte, pathological exceptions to this rule. One is- during the production of callus in a healing fractured where woven bone will form de novo.- after cancllous autograft, where new bone will form directly on to the cancellous graft.* However, the contribution of these circumstances to overall bone homeostasis is likely to be very small.* The total body rate of resorption (is the product of) = number of new cavities eroded in a defined time period Xaverage volume of each cavity.

C: Hashimotos thyroiditis Laboratory investigation of hypothyroidism: In the presence of suggestive symptoms and physical findings, a serum TSH test is needed for the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism, and it serves to assess the functional status of the thyroid. - This is a sensitive test of thyroid function; levels are invariably raised in hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis and in primary hypothyroidism of any cause. - The TSH level is also elevated in subclinical hypothyroidism and is usually the initial laboratory abnormality detected as the pituitary gland attempts to increase thyroid hormone production from the failing thyroid gland. The total T4 or free T4 usually remain within reference ranges in subclinical hypothyroidism. - The TSH level may also be elevated in the recovery phase of euthyroid sick syndrome. Medications that suppress TSH production include steroids, dopamine, dobutamine, and octreotide. A free T4 is usually needed to correctly interpret the TSH in some clinical settings. A low total T4 or free T4 level in the presence of an elevated TSH level fuher confirms the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. When a total T4 study, rather than a free T4 study, is performed, a T3 resin uptake helps to correct the total T4 and T3 values for protein binding, especially thyroid hormone-binding globulin (TBG) abnormalities, but the FT4 is typically the test of choice. T3 levels are most often maintained within reference ranges (even in the very late stages of hypothyroidism), and T3 measurement has little value in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The presence of thyroid autoantibodies, typically anti-TPO (anti thyroid peroxidase) and also anti-Tg (anti-thyroglobulin) antibodies, delineates the cause of hypothyroidism as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or its variant.

The diagnosis can usually be made when high amylase levels are found in the ascitic fluid. Definitive diagnosis is made by ERCP. Management The initial treatment usually is nonoperative and involves attempts to decrease pancreatic secretion by - elimination of enteral feeding - nasogastric drainage and - use of antisecretory hormone somatostatin About 50 to 60 % pts. respond to this tit. If considerably improvement does not occur within 2-3 weeks then these patients are treated either endoscopically or surgically. - Endoscopic tit involves endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy with or without placement of transpapillary pancreatic duct stent. By reducing the resistance to drainage into the duodenum, and by bridging the site of duct disruption, this approach is designed to allow the site of leakage to seal.

Principle of the test: Normally when one leg is raised from the ground the pelvis tilts upwaras on that side, through the action of the hip abductors of the standing limb. If the abductors are inefficient they are unable to sustain the pelvis against the body weight and it tilts downwards instead of rising up on the side of the lifted leg. Note that the test is performed with the patients standing on the affected leg. Abductor mechanism: It can be compared with the lever, with the body weight being trying to tilt the pelvis down; the hip joint being the fulcrum and the abductor muscles being the power acting throught the lever arm (from the head of the femur to attachment of the abductor muscles on the greater trochanter - the neck of the femur). Causes of positive trendelenberg test: Any failure of abductor mechanism causes dipping of the pelvic (ASIS) on the normal side. There are three fundamental causes: 1) Paralysis of the abductor muscles (Supplies gluteus medius & minimus) eg. Polio. Paralysis of superior gluteral nerve 2) Marked approximation of the inseion of the abductor muscles to their origin by upward displacement of the greater trochanter; so that the muscles are slack. eg. Severe coxa vara, dislocation of hip 3) Absence of stable fulcrum & lever arm about which the abductor muscles can act Neck femur fracture Dislocation of hip, Destructruction of head as in Pehe's diseases.",

        "exp": "PSA velocity Several refinements have been proposed to increase the sensitivity of the serum PSA for younger men more likely to die of prostate-cancer, while reducing the frequency of diagnosing cancers of low biologic potential in elderly men more likely to die of other causes. These modifications include age-specific reference ranges, using a lower \"upper\" limit of normal for younger males and higher \"upper\" limit for older individuals. Prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) is calculated by dividing the serum PSA level by the estimated prostate weight calculated from transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). It was proposed to correct for the influence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) on the measured level of PSA. Values <0. 10 are consistent with BPH, while values >0. 15 suggest the presence of cancer. PSAD levels also increase with age. PSA velocity is derived from calculations of the rate of change in PSA before the diagnosis of cancer was established. Increases of>0. 75 ng/mL per year are suggestive of cancer. For a 50-year-old male, an increase from 2. 5 to 3. 9 ng/mL in a I-year period would warrant fuher testing, even though the level is still in the \"normal\" range. Free and complexed PSA measurements are used to determine which men require a biopsy when the PSA level is in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL. In cancer, the level of free PSA is lower. Using a 25% threshold of free PSA for patients with levels in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL, specificity was improved by 20% while maintaining a sensitivity of95%. Fuher refinements to increase the specificity of distinguishing benign and malignant conditions involve the determination of the ratios of free to total, complexed to total, and free to complexed PSA. Using normal ranges for free/total PSA of>O. 15, for complexed total PSA of <0. 70, and for free/complexed PSA of>0. 25 improved specificity in one study by 20%.

Ischaemic renal dysfunction secondary to hypotension and diminished renal perfusion results in acute tubular necrosis and uraemia. \" Pathophysiology Crush injury can follow prolonged continuous pressure on muscle tissue. Crush injury can lead to crush syndrome. Ischaemia reperfusion (when the pressure is released. from the crushed limb) is the main mechanism of muscle injury in crush syndrome. There is traumatic rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle fibres with the leakage of potentially toxic cellular contents into the systemic circulation. Muscle injury causes large quantities of potassium, phosphate, myoglobin, creatine kinase and urate to leak into the circulation. Myoglobin levels in the plasma are normally very low. If a significant amount of skeletal muscle is damaged (>100 g) excess myoglobin is. filtered by the kidneys and can cause renal tubular obstruction and renal damage: the excess myoglobin is nephrotoxic. intravascular volume depletion and renal hypoperfusion, combined with myoglobinuria, result in renal dysfunction. 2 Crush syndrome is characterised by Hypovolaemic shock (due to sequestration of water in the injured muscle cells). Hyperkalaemia (release of cellular potassium by the injured muscle cells). This can also lead to: - Metabolic acidosis (release of cellular phosphate and sulphate by the injured muscle cells) - Acute renal failure - Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) The key clinical_ features of crush syndrome are: Crushing injury to a large mass of skeletal muscle.

Finasteride, Dutasteride, Triptorelin pamoate a-Adrenergic blockers Since activation of a, receptors in the bladder neck, prostate and prostatic urethra increases their smooth muscle tone, their blockade relaxes these structures, reducing the dynamic obstruction and increasing the urinary flow rate. 5a reductase inhibitor These drugs prevent the conversion of testosterone into more active dihydrotestosterone responsible for androgen action in many tissues including prostate. Their use results in reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptom. But six months of therapy is required to see the maximum effect on prostate size and symptomatic improvement and symptomatic improvement is seen only in men with enlarged prostate (> 40 cm3) Ref Smith's Urology 17/e. Since the patient in the question needs to relieve him of his symptoms till he gets fit to be operated, an a blocker (Terazocin) would be used. a-blockers afford faster and greater symptomatic relief than finasteride. The bad point about a blocker is that their effect lasts only till drug is given and even with continued therapy, benefits may decline after several years due to disease progression.

The drugs which are used are - Cisplatin Methotrexate 5 Fu Paclitaxel Docetaxel Sometimes combinations of these drugs are used. Remember these basic points about the t/t of head and neck cancers and one can apply them to all tumors of head and neck. a) Treatment of localized head and neck cancers - These tumors are treated with curative intent either with surgery or radiotherapy. The choice of modality differs according to anatomic location and institutional expertise. In early laryngeal cancer generally, radiotherapy is done to preserve voice while in early oral cavity cancers, surgery is preferred to avoid the long-term complication of radiation such as xerostomia and dental decay. b) Locally or advanced regional disease - Combined modality therapy including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy is used. Concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy appear to be most effective. c) Recurrent or metastatic disease - chemotherapy is used. Management of neck lymph nodes The neck lymph nodes should be treated when there are clinically positive nodes or the risk for occult disease is high based on the location and stage of the primary lesion. The decision to perform neck dissection or irradiate the neck is related to the treatment of the primary lesion. If the primary tumor is being treated with radiation and the neck is N0 or N1, the nodes are usually treated with irradiation. For surgically treated primary lesions, N0 or N1 neck disease may be treated surgically as well (Radical neck dissection/Modified neck dissection/Selective neck dissection). Negative prognostic factors such as extracapsular spread of tumor, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, fixation to surrounding structures, and multiple positive nodes are indicators for postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy. For N2 or N3 neck disease, neck dissection with planned postoperative radiation therapy is performed.",

        "exp": "Jerk test Repeat from May 09 Tests for Anterior shoulder instability Anterior shoulder drawer test- With the patient supine, the scapula is stabilized with one hand while the upper arm is grasped firmly with the other so as to manipulate the head of the humerus forwards and backwards (like a drawer). Apprehension test (Crank test) - this is a provocative test in which the examiner cautiously lifts the arm into abduction, external rotation and then extension, at the crucial moment the patient senses that the humeral head is about to slip out anteriorly and his body tautens in apprehension. Relocation test - this test involves placing the shoulder in the position of apprehension and applying a posteriorly directed force on the humeral head. The result is considered positive if this relieves the patient's apprehension. Fulcrum test- With the patient supine, the clinician takes the shoulder into 90 degrees abduction and adds lateral rotation and extension. The test indicates anterior instability if the patient becomes apprehensive. Tests for Posterior shoulder instability Jerk test- With the patient sitting and the shoulder abducted to 90 degrees and medially rotated, the clinician applies a longitudinal cephalad force to the humerus and moves the arm into horizontal flexion. A positive test is indicated if there is a sudden jerk as the arm is moved into horizontal flexion and as it is returned to the sta position. Posterior drawer test- The examiner passively displaces the huymeral head in a posterior direction. Pain, clicking, or an increase in humeral head translation indicates a positive test. Posterior apprehension test- The patient lies supine, with the shoulder flexed and internally rotated and with the elbow flexed and resting on the trunk. A posterior force is transmitted by the examiner through the subject's elbow. A look of apprehension and resistance to fuher movement constitutes a positive result. Push-pull test- The patient is positioned supine with the shoulder placed at a 90 degrees of scapular plane abduction. The examiner grasps the subject's wrist with one hand while the other hand is placed anteriorly near the humeral head. The examiner simultaneously pulls upward through the long axis of the forearm while pushing the humeral head posteriorly. A look of apprehension or displacement of the humeral head greater than 50% represents a postitive test. Circumduction test- The patient is in standing position. The examiner stands behind the patient grasping the patient's forearm with the hand. The examiner begins circumduction by extending the patient's arm while mainting slight abduction. As the circumduction continues into elevation, the arm is brought over the top and into the flexed and adducted postion. As the arm moves into forward flexion and adduction from above, it is vulnerable to posterior subluxation if the patient is unstable posteriorly. If the examiner palpates the posterior aspect of the patient's shoulder as the arm moves downward in forward flexion and adduction, the humeral head will be felt to subluxate posteriorly in a positive test. Jahnke test- A posteriorly directed force applied to the forward flexed shoulder. The shoulder is then moved into the coronal plane as an anterior directed force is applied to the humeral head. A clunk occurs as the humeral head reduces from the subluxed position. Tests for Inferior shoulder instability Sulcus sign- The patient stands with the arm by the side and shoulder muscles relaxed. The examiner grasps the patient's forearm below the elbow and pulls the arm distally. A positive test suggesting inferior instability of the shoulder is indicated if the patient's pain is reproduced and/or a sulcus appears distal to the acromian.",

These wounds require no dressing and are treated with topical salves to reduce pain. Oral NSAID, can be given for pain control. 2nd degree burn - Second degree wounds can be treated with daily dressing changes and topical antibiotics, cotton gauze, and elastic wraps. Alternatively the wounds can be treated with a temporary biologic or synthetic covering to close the wound. Deep 2nd degree & 3rd degree burns - Deep second degree and third degree burns are treated by excision and grafting. Initially dressing is used to check bacterial proliferation and provide occlusion until surgery is done. About option 'a' i. e. ' No bandage to head & neck' There are two methods of burn wound management with topical agents: 1) Open or exposure method - no dressings are applied over the wound after application of the topical agent to the wound 2) Closed method - an occlusive dressing is applied over the agent and is usually changed twice daily. The closed method is the preferred method except for places where it is difficult to apply the dressing material like - face & perineum. About option 'b' i. e. 'Immediate application of ice cold water'. Iced water should never be used, even on the smallest of burns. If ice or cold water is used on larger burns, systemic hypothermia often follows, and the associated cutaneous vasoconstriction can extend the thermal damage (Schwartz 8/e, p 192) Room temperature water can be poured on the wound within 15 minutes of injury to decrease the depth of the wound but any subsequent measures to cool the wound are avoided to prevent hypothermia during resuscitation (Sabiston 18/e, p 566)",

There are three main types of Rhabdomyosarcoma; Embryonal, Pleomorphic and Alveolar. 1. Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma (Sarcoma botryoides) Usually arises in the orbit or genitourinary tract in children. The botryoid type of Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma, which frequently originates in mucosa-lined visceral organs such as the vagina and the urinary bladder, generally grows as a polypoid tumor. These tumors may disseminate widely, but are responsive to chemotherapy and radiation. Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma occasionally arise in adults. Although regression of tumor in response to pediatric chemotherapy regimens usually occurs, age is an impoant prognostic factor for survival, with worse outcomes in older patients. 2. Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma Extremity Rhabdomyosarcoma in adolescents and young adults often has an alveolar histology. Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma is composed of ill-defined aggregates of poorly differentiated round or oval cells that frequently show central loss of cellular cohesion and formation of irregular alveolar spaces. These tumors appear to have a worse prognosis than Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma in younger children, but not in adults. A specific translocation, t (2, 13) (q37; q14) involving the PAX3 gene on chromosome 2 and the FKHR gene on chromosome 13, is seen in the majority of alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma. 3.

Schwaz writes- \"The overall objectives are to increase the probability of spontaneous closure. Most surgeons would pursue 2 to 3 months of conservative therapy before considering surgical intervention. This approach is based on evidence that 90% of fistulas that are going to close, close within a 5-week interval, and also that surgical interventions after this time period are associated with better outcomes and lower morbidity. If the fistula fails to resolve during this period, surgery may be required during which the fistula tract, together with the segment of intestine from which it originates, should be resected. \" Conservative management consists of Fluid and electrolyte resuscitation Nutrition, usually through TPN; TPN allows bowel to rest Control of sepsis with antibiotics and drainage of abscesses Treatment with 1-12 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors or Somatostatin analogues (Octreotide) decreases fistula output. Factors inhibiting spontaneous closure: Malnutrition Foreign body within the fistula tract Radiation enteritis Malignant fistula Inflammatory bowel disease Local inflammation and sepsis High output fistula Sho fistulous tract (<2 cm) Epithelialization of the fistula tract Distal obstruction of the intestine Fistulas can be divided into 3 types according to 'output' - low output (<200 mL/24 hr), - moderate output (200-500 mL/24 hr), and high output (>500 mL/24 hr).",

Ve p 52, 1952] Angioedema is essentially an anaphylaxis limited to the skin and subcutaneous tissues and can be due to drug allergy, insect stings or bites, desensitization injections or ingestion of ceain foods (paicularly eggs, shellfish or nuts) Sometimes reactions occur explosively after ingestion of minute amounts. Others (e. g. reactions to strawberries), may occur only after overindulgence and possibly result from direct (toxic) mediator liberation. It is characterized by a diffuse and painful swelling of loose subcutaneous tissue, e. g. dorsum of hands or feet, eyelids, lips, genitalia and mucous membrane. Edema of the upper airways may produce respiratory distress and the stridor may be mistaken for asthma. Treatment Epinephrine should be the first treatment for acute pharyngeal or laryngeal angioedema. This may be supplemented, by a nebulized agonist (e. g. albuterol) and an I. V. antihistamine (diphenhydramine). This is usually sufficient to prevent airway obstruction hut intubating or performing a tracheostomy and administering 0, might be necessary. Also know Uicaria This is also an anaphylaxis reaction, but in uicarias the disease is limited to the superficial tissues. Uicaria is characterized by local wheals and erythema in the superficial dermis whereas angioedema is a deeper swelling due to edematous areas in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Generally, pruritus is the first symptom, which is followed sholy by the appearance of wheals that may remain small (1-5 mm) or enlarge. The larger ones tend to be clear in the centre and may be noticed, first as large rings (> 20 cm across) of erythema and edema. Also know If acute angioedema is recurrent progressive, painful rather than pruritic and not associated with uicaria a hereditary enzyme deficiency should be considerd. Hereditary angioneurotic edema occurs due to loss of C1 inhibitor (regulatory protein) CIF of hereditary angioneuroedema - Episodes of laryngeal edema - Prominence of recurrent gastrointestinal attacks - lack of pruritus and of uicarial lesions Laboratory diagnosis of hereditary angioneuroedema - It depends upon demonstrating the deficiency of C1 inhibitor",

The prophylaxis can be mechanical or pharmacological. Prophylaxis for DVT Mechanical prophylaxis include Early ambulation Pneumatic compression devices * * * It is the simplest method of prophylaxis It acts by activating the calf pump mechanism It is the most common method of prophylaxis * Pneumatic compresses prevents the stasis by periodically compressing the calves Pharmacological prophylaxis includes: Use of unfractionated heparin * Now being replaced by fractionated low molecular weight hepatin Use of fractionated low molecular * Better efficacy than unfractionated heparin weight heparin * No laboratory monitoring is necessary Comparison of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with mechanical prophylaxis demonstrates superiority of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in reduction of the development of venous thromboembolic disease. Prospective trials evaluating LMWH in head injured and trauma patients have also proven safety of LMWH with no increase in intracranial bleeding or major bleeding at other sites. In addition, LMWH shows significant reduction in the development of venous thromboembolism compared to other methods. In sho, LMWH should be considered the optimal method of prophylaxis in moderate and high risk patients. Even the traditional reluctance to use heparin in high risk groups such as the multiply injured trauma patient and the injured patient must be reexamined, given the efficacy and safety profile of LMWH in multiple prospective trials.",

The possibility of intestinal obstruction is considered if an infant does not pass meconium for 24-36 hrs. Differential diagnosis would include causes of low intestinal obstruction. - Hirschsprung disease - Beal or colonic atresia/stenosis - Meconium ileus - Meconium plug syndrome - Neonatal small left colon syndrome The first investigation is always a plain abdominal radiograph (supine and left lateral decubitus view) Next investigation is a contrast enema also k/a lower GI series (presence of any perforation can be ruled out from plain X-rays) Barium can be used but water-soluble contrast agents are used commonly Contrast enema helps to some extent in differentiating among the causes of low intestinal obstructions. Hirschsprung's disease- Barium enema usually shows a transition zone between dilated proximal colon and a smaller-caliber obstructed distal colon caused by the nonrelaxation of the agaglionic bowel. However, a normal study does not exclude Hirschsprung's disease. Diagnosis is confirmed by rectal biopsy. Meconium ilens- Meconium ileus occurs when meconium becomes inspissated and obstructs the distal ileum. The condition is usually a manifestation of cystic fibrosis. Meconium ileus is usually taken to be synonymous with cystic fibrosis until proven otherwise, and meconium ileus is generally the earliest manifestation of the disease. Contrast enema study typically demonstrates microcolon, which is a reflection of underused bowel. Meconium plug syndrome Meconium plug syndrome, also termed functional immaturity of the colon, is a transient disorder of the newborn colon characterized by delayed passage (>24-48 h) of meconium and intestinal dilatation. Currently, meconium plug syndrome is understood as a transient functional disorder of the colon resulting from immaturity of the myenteric plexus nerve cells or their hormonal receptors. Contrast enema demonstrates the retained meconium as a filling defect or plug that produces a double-contrast effect. Usually, the colon is normal or may be mildly enlarged and filled with meconium. A change in the colon's diameter at the splenic flexure may be seen and is indistinguishable from that observed in Hirschsprung disease, although in the latter disorder the transition zone usually is in the rectosigmoid. Meconium plug syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion. Contrast enema usually eliminates congenital small bowel obstruction and rare colon abnormalities such as atresia or duplication. The primary differential consideration is Hirschsprung disease, which is diagnosed eventually in approximately 10-30% of patients with apparent meconium plug syndrome Neonatal small left colon syndrome - Colonic obstruction with a characteristic caliber reduction in the sigmoid and descending colon unrelated to meconium inspissation or aganglionosis. This condition has a frequent association with maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and seldom requires surgical intervention. A contrast enema demonstrated a narrowed descending and sigmoid colon, with a caliber transition at the splenic flexure.",

Frequently, the sac is empty or contains a small poion of greater omentum because the mouth of the hernia is usually small. The patient with an epigastric hernia may be asymptomatic. The features in a symptomatic patient may include: Pain - which varies from mild epigastric pain to a deep burning pain radiating to the back or the lower abdomen An abdominal mass - which may be palpable and tender Abdominal bloating Vomiting, nausea Aggravated by eating Relieved by reclining so that the mass falls away from the anterior abdominal wall Smaller hernia are prone to incarceration and strangulation.

GOOD TO KNOW: CD3 is a T cell marker. CD21 is a B-cell marker. Myogenin is a marker for rhabdomyosarcoma. Ewing sarcoma: It typically involves the diaphyseal region of long bones and also has an affinity for flat bones.
