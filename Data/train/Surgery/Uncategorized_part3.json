        "exp": "\"Surgery should be recommended for patients who continue to be bothered by their symptoms or who experience urinary retention despite medical therapy. Surgery should also be recommended for patients with upper tract dilation, renal insufficiency secondary to BPH, or bladder stones. \"- Schwartz 8/e p1. 530 About other options: Prostate Size: Treatment of BPH is primarily dictated by patient's symptoms and not by the prostate size. However the size of prostate can decide whether to go for endoscopic method of treatment or open surgical procedure. Open surgery is more effective than endoscopic methods for prostates weighing >100gm (ref: Schwartz 9/e p1471; Smith's Urology I7/e p. 3. 54) UTI: Recurrent episodes of UTI (and not a single episode) are an absolute indication for surgery of prostate. Hypertension: Alpha blockers which are first line medical therapy for BPH lower the blood pressure and thus are helpful in hypertensive persons. Management of BPH Management is primarily directed by symptoms. Mild symptoms can be managed with watchful waiting. More severe symptomatic patients are treated with medicines (alpha blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors or combination of both). Surgery is recommended if the patient is having problems despite medical therapy. Absolute indications for surgery as listed in Smith's Urology is given below. Absolute indications for surgical treatment of BPH Refractory urine retention (failing at least one attempt at catheter removal) Recurrent UTI from BPH Bladder stones d/t BPH Renal insufficiency d/t BPH Large bladder diverticula secondary to BPH Recurrent gross hematuria from BPH Upper tract dilatation is an indication for surgery according to Schwartz. Medical therapy Alpha-blockers (terazosin, doxazosin, and tamsulosin) Alpha-blockers help is reducing the symptoms of BPH by blocking the alpha 1 adrenoreceptors present in human prostate and bladder base. 5-Alpha-reductase inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride) - 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. This thus results in reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptoms (after several months of use). Surgery Surgery for BPH is most commonly performed endoscopically; however, if the prostate gland is quite large (approx >100 g), an open prostatectomy should be performed. The standard endoscopic procedure for BPH is a transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate. Conventional surgical methods: Transurethral resection of the prostate (most commonly used method) Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) Open simple prostatectomy (simple suprapubic prostatectomy, simple retropubic prostatectomy) - When the prostate is too large to be removed endoscopically, an open enucleation is necessary. What constitutes \"too large\" is subjective and varies depending upon the surgeon's experience with TURP. Glands >100 g are usually considered for open enucleation. Open prostatectomy may also be initiated when concomitant bladder diverticulum or a bladder stone is present or if dorsal lithotomy positioning is not possible. Open prostatectomies can be done with either a suprapubic or retropubic approach. A simple suprapubic prostatectomy is performed transvesically and is the operation of choice in dealing with concomitant bladder pathology. Minimally invasive methods: Laser therapy (Nd: YAG and holmium: YAG ) Transurethral electro vaporization of the prostate Microwave Hyperthermia Transurethral needle ablation of the prostate- High-intensity focused ultrasound for thermal tissue ablation Intraurethral stents-stents are endoscopically placed in the prostatic fossa and are designed to keep the prostatic urethra patent. They are usually covered by urothelium within 4-6 months after insertion. These devices are typically used for patients with limited life expectancy who are not deemed to be appropriate candidates for surgery or anesthesia.",

        "exp": "Ans. D: 3 The Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS, also known as the Glasgow Coma Score is a neurological scale which aims to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person, for initial as well as continuing assessment. The scale comprises three tests: eye, verbal and motor responses. The three values separately as well as their sum are considered. The lowest possible GCS is 3 (deep coma or death), while the highest is 15 (fully awake person). Best eye response (E) There are 4 grades staing with the most severe: No eye opening - Eye opening in response to pain. (Patient responds to pressure on the patient's fingernail bed; if this does not elicit a response, supraorbital and sternal pressure or rub may be used.) - Eye opening to speech. (Not to be confused with an awaking of a sleeping person; such patients receive a score of 4, not 3.) - Eyes opening spontaneously Best verbal response (V) There are 5 grades staing with the most severe: - No verbal response - Incomprehensible sounds. (Moaning but no words.) - Inappropriate words. (Random or exclamatory aiculated speech, but no conversational exchange) - Confused. (The patient responds to questions coherently but there is some disorientation and confusion.) Oriented. (Patient responds coherently and appropriately to questions such as the patient's name and age, where they are and why, the year, month, etc.) Best motor response (M) There are 6 grades staing with the most severe: - No motor response - Extension to pain (adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm, extension of wrist, decerebrate response) - Abnormal flexion to pain (adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm, flexion of wrist, decoicate response) - Flexion/ Withdrawal to pain (flexion of elbow, supination of forearm, flexion of wrist when supra-orbital pressure applied; pulls pa of body away when nailbed pinched) - Localizes to pain. (Purposeful movements towards painful stimuli; e. g., hand crosses mid-line and gets above clavicle when supra-orbital pressure applied.) Obeys commands. (The patient does simple things as asked.) Interpretation Individual elements as well as the sum of the score are impoant. Hence, the score is expressed in the form \"GCS 9 = E2 V4 M3 Severity of head injury: Severe: GCS 3-8 Moderate: GCS 9 - 13 Mild head injury: GCS 14-15 with loss of consciousness (LOC) Minor: GCS 15 with no LOC The GCS has limited applicability to children, especially below the age of 36 months (where the verbal performance of even a healthy child would be expected to be poor). Consequently the Paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale, a separate yet closely related scale, was developed for assessing younger children.",

Post op ileus may be prolonged in the presence of hypoproteinemia or metabolic abnromality. Paralytic ileus is a state in which there is failure of transmission of peristaltic waves secondary to neuromuscular failure. The resultant stasis leads to accumulation of fluid and gas within the bowel with associated distention, vomiting, absent or diminished bowel sounds and absolute constipation. Radiological picture shows dilated gas filled bowel loops with multiple air-fluid level. The picture is similar to mechanical small bowel obstruction; the only differentiating point is presence of gas in colon and rectum in paralytic ileus. Other clinical differentiating features of paralytic ileus from mechanical small bowel obstruction are. 1) Pain - Pain is colicky in mechanical obstruction. Pain is not a feature of paralytic ileus and if present is a steady, diffuse pain. 2) Bowel sounds - Bowel sounds are hypoactive or absent in paralytic ileus in contrast to hyperactive bowel sounds in mechanical obstruction.",

        "exp": "Hepatic failure occurring in cirrhosis reduces the capacity of the liver to synthesize sufficient quantities of plasma proteins (mostly albumin) necessary to maintain plasma oncotic pressure. Low plasma oncotic pressure allows fluid from the intravascular fluid component to move into the interstitial space, producing plasma volume contraction and edema. Lymphatic obstruction occurs as a result of mechanical blockage of lymphatics by tumor, inflammatory processes, or ceain parasitic infections. Cirrhosis does not lead to lymphatic obstruction. Reduced central venous pressure does not cause edema. Conversely, increased central venous pressure, which may arise with congestive heart failure, thrombosis, or cirrhosis can lead to increased hydrostatic pressure and edema. Sodium retention is an impoant cause of edema in patients with poor renal perfusion. The kidneys respond by retaining sodium and increasing plasma volume in an effo to increase renal blood flow. Sodium retention in cirrhosis is secondary to the decrease in plasma oncotic pressure and consequent decrease in plasma volume. Ref: Geller D. A., Goss J. A., Tsung A. (2010). Chapter 31. Liver.

PUJ obstruction is asymptomatic. Cambell writes - \" Now the almost universal use of prenatal sonography has made discovery of PUJ obstruction a common occurance\" Diagnostic tools? Majority of cases are diagnosed prenatally with the help of ultrasound. Whitaker test (pressure - flow studies) can be used to find out obstruction to flow of urine. In whitaker test catheters are placed in renal pelvis and bladder. Fluid is infused into the kidney and the pressures are measured. A differential pressure between kidney and bladder could then be indicative of obstruction to the flow. Retrograde pyelography can be useful to locate the site of obstruction. Surgical repair Congenital PUJ obstruction are corrected by either-open surgical techniques or -endoscopic and laparascopic approaches Out of the 'open' techniques the Anderson- Hynes Dismembered Pyeloplasty is the most commonly employed technique.

        "question": "Neurocardiagenic syncope, the least useful investigation is:",
        "exp": "Carotid duplex scan Neurocardiogenic syncope is also called vasovagal syncope or vasodepressor syncope. It is considered to be an abnormality in the complex neurocardiovascular interactions responsible for maintaining systemic and cerebral perfusion. Under normal circumstances, upright posture causes venoul polling and a transient decrease in aerial pressure, resulting in unloading of baroreceptors. Reflex augumentation of sympathetic activity and parasympathetic withdrawl results in peripheral aerial vasoconstriction, venoconstriction and an increase in heart rate and contractility. These adaptive mechanisms serve to maintain normal systemic and cerebral perfusion. Individuals susceptible to neurocardiogenic syncope are unable to maintain the adaptive neurocardiovascular response to upright posture for prolonged periods. In these patients due to incompletely understood mechanisms the cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors are stimulated resulting in increased neural stimulus to vasomotor centre. This results in reflex paradoxical vasodilation and bradycardia. The final result is hypotension, cerebral hypopeifusion, cerebral hypoxia and syncope. Diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope: Tilt table study It is used to evaluate patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. In a tilt table study the patient is strapped to a table which is then mechanically tilted to an upright position. While monitoring the pulse, blood pressure, electrocardiogram and sometimes blood oxygen saturation, the patient is left in a 'motionless standing position' for 20 to 30 minutes. When the patient's syncope is reproduced during the test a \"positive\" tilt table study is said to have occurred. During an upright tilt, a patient's cardiovascular system has to adjust itself in order to prevent a significant poion of the blood volume from pooling in the legs. These adjustments consists of a mild increase in heart rate and a constriction of blood vessels in the legs. When a normal individual is placed in an upright tilt, these cardiovascular adjustments occur very quickly, and there is no significant drop in the blood pressure. However, in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, these adjustments do not occur. Carotid sinus massage In patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, the symptoms can be elicited by carotid sinus massage. Ohostatic blood pressure recording Supine and upright blood pressure monitoring should be done in all patients with neurocardiogenic syncope.

Depth of invasion is the most impoant histologic prognostic parameter in primary melanoma. Breslow depth and Clark level are two different classifications of depth of invasion. Breslow depth is a quantitative measurement of the depth of invasion by measuring the tumor thickness with an ocular micrometer. Clark's staging refers to the histologic level of invasion, using the epidermis, papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and subcutaneous fat as the histologic boundaries. With the 2002 AJCC staging classification, tumor thickness measured by Breslow depth was determined to be primary factor for T staging. The presence of ulceration was found to be a powerful predictor of survival, and hence it is incorporated in the staging system. Ref: Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery edited by Maria Z.

The secondary attack rate in household contacts approaches 90%. It is transmitted from person to person by droplet infection and nuclei, and most patients are infected by \"face to face\" contacts.

        "exp": "VDRL The history of the patient suggests neurosyphilis. Diagnosis of Neurosvphilis No definitive tool / test exists to establish the diagnosis of neurosyphilis with 100% accuracy. Most of the serological tests used in the diagnosis of syphilis cannot accurately diagnosis neurosyphilis. Hence, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis usually depends on combination of clinical features plus C. S. F. finding and serological tests. C. S. F. findings in syphilis:? - Lymphocytic pleocytosis - Protein is moderately elevated - Glucose is usually normal Among the serological tests - \"The VDRL C. S. F. test is the standard serological test for C. S. F. and is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis\". -Since invasion of C. S. F by syphilis stimulates production of antilipoidal antibodies in C. S. F.. VDRL test can be performed on C. S. F. to diagnose neurosyphilis. - The VDRL test is highly specific albeit insensitive for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. - The sensitivity of VDRL*for neurosyphilis is 30% and specificity is 90%. Specific treponemol tests have proved to be quite inaccurate in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis Why??? - The antibodies against the specific treponemal antigen have the tendency to cross C. S. F., so enough antibodies may be present in the C. S. F. even before neurosyphilis develops. - Therefore specific treponemal tests have no specificity for neurosyphilis. The CS. F. becomes positive for these tests even when neurosyphilis is not present. Moreover, Specific treponemal tests cannot be used to monitor treatment because? - These tests become positive soon after infection and typically remain positive. for life despite adequate treatment. An impoant point - Like VDRL test RPR test can also be used to monitor the treatment in syphilis but it is not suitable for testing C. S. F., so it cannot he used in neurosyphilis.

Treatment: The prognosis of primary CNS lymphoma is poor compared to histologically similar lymphoma occurring outside the CNS. Many patients experience a dramatic and radiographic clinical response to glucocoicoids however it inevitably relapses within weeks. The mainstay of definitive therapy is chemotherapy including high-dose methotrexate. This is followed in patients < 60 years with radiotherapy. The mainstay of definitive therapy is chemotherapy.

She is experiencing good fetal movement and has had no loss of fluid, bleeding from the vagina, or contractions. She has no complaints. Her past medical history is significant for mitral stenosis, which she developed after an episode of rheumatic fever as a child. She also has asthma for which she uses an albuterol inhaler daily. She has herpes outbreaks approximately once a year. At her last visit she was found to be positive for Group B Streptococcus colonization. For which of the following disease processes would this patient benefit by having a forceps-assisted vaginal delivery at the time of delivery?",
        "exp": "Ans: D.). Mitral Stenosis. Mitral valve stenosis is one of the more common valvular lesions seen in pregnancy. The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic endocarditis. During normal pregnancy there is an increase in the cardiac output and an increase in preload and circulating volume. Patients with mitral stenosis have a fixed, decreased valve area, which places them at risk for the development of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary edemA. Control of arrhythmias is absolutely essential in these patients because they are at increased risk, given the left atrial enlargement that often goes along with their mitral stenosis. Labor and delivery can be a paicularly dangerous time for these patients. Therefore, patients with significant mitral stenosis should be monitored invasively using a Swan-Ganz catheter. It is recommended that the second stage of labor be shoened using forceps or vacuum to prevent excess maternal Valsalva effos and maternal tachycardia. Asthma ( Choice A)is not an indication for forceps-assisted vaginal delivery. In terms of mode of delivery, asthmatic patients may be managed like any other patient in the second stage of labor.

Zenker's diveicula are rarely seen below 30 years of age, most patients are over 50 years of age. Dysphagia is the most common symptom.

        "exp": "Recurrent bleeding episodes Make it clear once and for always. \"Despite having been named lupus \"anticoagulant\" lupus anticoagulation syndrome does not present with bleeding\". Lupus anticoagulant is characterized by the presence of circulating lupus anticoagulant in the body but its predominant symptonz is thrombosis.. The circulating anticoagulants do not exe any anticoagulant effect in vivo instead they act in vitro. The main symptoms of lupus anticoagulant is thrombosis. The thrombotic manifestations are entirely independent of anticoagulant or antiphospholipid antibodies. The reason for thrombosis is not quite clear but it has no relation with circulating anticoagulants. The thrombotic episodes are life threatening. Bleeding episodes in lupus anticoagulant -Bleeding may occur with lupus anticoagulant but is quite rare and do not lead to life threatening hemorrhage. According to William's hematology - Although thrombocytopenia is a common finding in APS, bleeding complications, are rare even with severe thrombocytopenia bleeding in an antiphospholipid antibody syndrome should trigger evaluation for the presence of antiprothrombin antibodies and other disorders that may affect hemostasis such as DIC and Uremia. Thrombocytopenia due to antiplatelet antibodies is usually mild to moderate without bleeding (Tejinder Singh hematology Atlas). Many cases of lupus anticoagulant can be \"asymptomatic\" too. Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome fall into two categories. Secondary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. In this cases antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is associated with an autoimmune disease usually SLE. Primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. In these cases there is no evidence of other autoimmune disease, the patient exhibit only the manifestations of antiphospholiipid antibody syndrome. Clinical manifestations ill' lupus Lupus anticoagulant increases the PTT but not the PT. Lupus anticoagulant syndrome is characterized by the presence of circulating anticoagulants or the antiphospholipid antibodies. But the predominant symptom of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is thrombosis. The question which immediately comes to mind is, how a patient with circulating anticoagulant has thrombosis as its predominant manifestation?? The point to emphasize here is that circulating anticoagulants are not responsible for any clinical syndrome in case of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. These antibodies are unable to exe any effect in circulation. They act as anticoagulants only in invitro not invivo. The thrombotic manifestations are entirely independent of anticoagulant or antiphospholipid antibodies. The reason for thrombosis is not quiet clear but it has no relation with circulating anticoagulants. The effect of circulating anticoagulant is seen only during laboratory test where their presence increase the PTT. The anticoagulants exe this effect by acting against phospholipids. These anionic phospholipids are present on the plasma membranes of the activated platelets, which form platelet plugs at the site of injury. The coagulation. factors assemble on the surface of activated platelets and thus becomes concentrated at sites of vascular injury. The circulating anticoagulants acts by blocking these phospholipids. NOW, Two questions crops up, Why do the circualting anticoagulants do not exe their effect in vivo? \"And why do these antiocoagulants affect only PTT and not PT. \" Explanation While performing PTT patient is given calcium, paial thromboplastin along with an intrinsic pathway activator. Paial thromboplastin contains the phospholipid needed for coagulation. If the patients plasma, contain antiphospholipid antibodies, it will inhibit the phospholipids present in the paial thromboplastin. Since the paial thromboplastin has limited phospholipids the coagulation gets inhibited by the anticoagulants and thus the PTT increases. On the other hand in the body there is abundant supply of phospholipids from the platelets therefore the antiphospholipid antibodies are not able to affect the coagulation. Platelets continuously replenish the phspholipids. While performing test for prothrotnbin time(PT) patient is given tissue. factor i. e. thromboplastin. Thromboplastin contains abundant supply of phospholipid so the circulating (plasma) anticoagulants are not able to exe their effect on it, and thus PT remains normal Coagulation tests in lupus anticoagulant.

        "question": "Which of the following features characterizes apoptosis but not necrosis?",
        "exp": "Apoptosis is a form of cell death that serves to eliminate unwanted cells during development, maintain cell numbers in intact organs or tissues, and eliminate immune cells after an immune response has faded. Apoptosis also occurs in response to noxious agents and in the aging process. The process is the result of execution of an internal program mediated by the expression of a number of different genes. In the process of apoptosis, cells shrink and cytoplasmic organelles become more densely packed. Cytoplasmic blebs may form, and apoptotic bodies (membrane-bound cellular fragments) can be produced. The most characteristic feature of apoptosis is a distinctive peripheral aggregation of chromatin, sometimes accompanied by breaking up of the nucleus into several fragments. In necrosis, the chromatin may become more pale (karyolysis), or form irregular clumps, and the nucleus itself may shrink into a dense pyknotic body. Disaggregation of polyribosomes is characteristic of the initial stages of cellular injury and necrosis. Eosinophilia characterizes both apoptosis and necrosis. Inflammation is typically absent in apoptosis, in contrast to necrosis. Ref: Jan B. V., Lowry S. F. (2010). Chapter 2. Systemic Response to Injury and Metabolic Suppo. In F. C. Brunicardi, D. K.

Most common complications of intracapsular fracture neck femur are nonunioin & fixation failure (more common in most series of displaced fractures) and avascular necrosis (more common in most series of undisplaced fractures). Shoening is seen in almost all cases of nonunion & AVN. Chances of avascular necrosis (AVN) and nonunion increases as the fracture site becomes more proximal Q. The more proximal the fracture located the worse the prognosis.

The probable causes of nonunion in fracture neck femur are - - Cambium layer of periosteum which produce callus is missing. There fore femoral neck must heal direct endosteal healing only. There is no contact with soft tissues which could promote callus formation. Precarious blood supply: by tearing the ascending cervical branches or retinacular vessels the injury deprives head of its main blood supplyQ. Synol fluid interfere with fracture healing as it prevents clotting of fracture hematoma and release angiogenic inhibiting factors. - Inadequate reduction and improper immobilization. * It is impoant to note that avascular necrosis and nonunion are independent events, because AVN is based on vascular supply of femoral head, whereas nonunion is based on the healing process. So AVN can occur even in united fractures. * Femoral neck fractures should unite by 6 months. If there is no evidence of healing or patient continued to have pain at 3 - 6 months after surgery then a delayed (3 months) or non union ( 6 months) should be contemplated. * AVN is a late complication and ischemic collapse usually occur with in 2 -years of fracture. According to anatomical location of fracture neck femur the chances of AVN & nonunion in decreasing order are: subcapital (transepiphyseal in children) > TranscervicalQ > Basicervical. - Temponade effect of intracapsular hematoma causing floating of both fracture ends and making reduction difficult.",

A hard, irregular nodule on the posterior surface of the prostate is appreciated on rectal examination. Plasma levels of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) are markedly increased. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "This is the typical clinical presentation of carcinoma of the prostate, which is probably the most frequent cancer in males (although lung cancer is the most frequent neoplastic cause of death). Autopsy studies show that small foci of adenocarcinoma are found in the prostate of up to 70% of men older than 80. Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) is expressed by both normal prostatic tissue and adenocarcinoma of the prostate. A rise in PSA plasma levels, therefore, simply results from any increase in the mass of prostatic tissue and cannot be used to differentiate between cancer and hyperplasia. Cancer arises more frequently in the peripheral zone of the gland, producing firm nodules on the posterior surface that can be detected on rectal examination. Metastasis to the bone can be osteoblastic (with formation of new bone) or osteolytic (with destruction of bone). Osteoblastic metastases in the veebral column are characteristic of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Chronic prostatitis presents with dysuria and perineal discomfo. The diagnosis relies on finding at least 10 leukocytes per high-power field on microscopic examination of expressed prostatic secretions. Chronic prostatitis is fuher classified into bacterial prostatitis if cultures are positive for bacteria, or abacterial prostatitis if cultures are negative. Increased plasma PSA is frequently seen. Multiple myeloma is a neoplasm of plasma cells that frequently manifests with osteolytic (not osteoblastic) lesions in the veebral column as well as other bones, such as the cranial vault and ribs. Prostatic hyperplasia is an extremely common disorder in middle-aged and elderly men. It involves the periurethral zone of the gland, leading to compression of the urethra, difficulty in urination, urinary retention, and recurrent cystitis. PSA levels are increased in a manner roughly propoional to the degree of prostatic enlargement. Ref: La Rochelle J., Shuch B., Belldegrun A. (2010). Chapter 40. Urology. In F. C. Brunicardi, D. K.

Spinal shock occurs when the spinal cord fails temporarily following injury. Even pas of spinal cord with out structural damage do not function.

Return of bulbocavernous reflex and anal wink (i. e. primitive reflexes) indicate, spinal shock has endedQ In the absence of sacral sparing (i. e. there is no sacral sensations) and with return of bulbocavernosus reflex (i. e. spinal shock is over which typically occurs with in 24 - 48 hours) the spinal cord injury is termed complete and there is viually no likelihood of functional spinal cord recovery.

Decubitus ulcer in the scrotum. Treatment Jaboulay's method of eversion of sac; In this procedure the hydrocele fluid is let out after opening the sac through scrotal incision and then eversion of sac is done so that the secreting surface of the tunica vaginalis turned outside Lord's procedure; in case of small hydrocele and thin sac, plication of the sac is done Excision of the sac done in case of massive hydrocele with thickened sac.

Most patients with Gout have hyperuricemia due to decreased uric acid excretion by the kidney The underlying basis of gout is an increased total body urate pool. This is generally manifested as hypercuricemia and persistant hyperuricemia is the most impoant risk factor for gouty ahritis (Although hyperuricemia alone is not synonymous with gout) This hyperuricemia can result from increased urate production or decreased uric acid excretion by the kidneys or a combination of both mechanisms The most common mechanism of hyperuricemia in gout is a defect in the renal handing of uric acid (and not uric acid over production). `Over 90% of individuals with sustained hyper uricemia have a defect in the renal handling of uric acid' `Fewer than 5% of patients with gout are hyper uricemic because of urate overproduction' -- Current Rheumatology Uric Acid levels may be normal at the time of an acute attack - Although most patients with acute gouty ahritis have associated hyperuricemia, elevated uric acid levels are not essential for the diagnosis of gout. This limits the value of serum uric acid determinations for the diagnosis of gout. Gout is caused whenever, synol fluid is supersaturated with uric acid, irrespective of serum concentration of uric acid. The serum levels of uric acid can be normal or even low at the time of an attack and hence its determination is not diagnostic for gout. Gout is more common in Men than Women (Male > Female) Gout presents predominantly in men Women represent only 5-20% of all patients with gout Definitive diagnosis of gout requires aspiration of synol fluid Definitive diagnosis of gout requires aspiration of the involved joint and demonstration of intracellular monosodium urate crystals in synol fluid. Under polarized light these are demonstrated as \"strongly negative birefringent needle shaped crystals. \" Demonstration of Strong negative birefringent needle shaped crystals of monosodium urate polarized light microscopy Tophi are aggregates of monosodium urate monohydrate crystals that form in extra aicular and aicular structures and cause deformity and destruction of hard and soft tissue.",

Psoriatic ahritis involves DIP joints and the DOC for psoriatic ahritis is methotrexate. Psoriatic ahritis Psoriatic ahritis refers to an inflammatory ahritis that characteristically occurs in individuals with psoriasis. Only 5% of patients with psoriasis develop ahritis. In 60-70% of cases, psoriasis precedes joint disease. In 15-20%, the two manifestations appear within 1 year of each other. In about 15-20% of cases, the ahritis precedes the onset of psoriasis and can present a diagnostic challange. Clinical features The usual age at onset is 30-50 years. The patient may present with one of several patterns of joint involvement. These include: Ahritis of distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints Assymetrical oligoahritis: Most common pattern Symmetrical polyahritis similar to RA Axial involvement (sacroiliac and spine) similar to ankylosing spondylitis Ahritis multilans So, Psoriatic ahritis can present with symptoms similar to any other inflammatory ahritis (RA, AS) or with any other different pattern. Shoening of digitis, called telescoping, because of underlying osteolysis is paicularly characteristic of Psoriatic ahritis and there is much greater tendency than in RA for both fibrous and bony ankylosis. Other findings are enthesitis, nail changes, and tenosynovitis. Treatment of Psoriatic ahritis Anti TNF - a agents eg etanercept and infliximab are newer drugs and are effective even in longstanding restistent PsA cases to previous therapy and extensive skin lesion. Methotrexate is drug of choice. Other effective agents are sulfasalazine, cyclosporine, retinoic acid & psoralen & UV-A (PUV A).

It is now recognized that the specialized intestinal type epithelium found in the Barrett's mucosa is the only tissue predisposed to malignant degeneration. Consequently, the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is presently made given any length of endoscopically identifiable columnar mucosa that proves on biopsy to show intestinal metaplasia. While long segments of columnar mucosa without metaplasia do occur, they are uncommon and are probably congenital in origin.

Age of the patient EHPVO is an impoant cause of non-cirrhotic poal hypertension in third world countries. It is the most common cause of poal hypertension in children. It is also the most common cause of upper gastro intestinal bleeding in child, en. Malena and Anemia These indicate upper al. bleed. Poal hypertension is the most common cause of upper G. I. bleeding in India. Upper bleeding occurs due to gastroesophageal variceal bleed. Extrahepatic poal vein obstruction is an impoant cause of poal hypertension in children in India. The most common presentation of EHPVO in children is well tolerated variceal bleed and splenomegaly. The child gives H/0 passing black coloured stools on 2-3 occasions. Pain in left hvpochondrium Pain in left hypochondrium occurs due to splenomegaly. Splenomegaly is. found in 75-100% of patients. In the chronic stage splenomegaly is universal. Lump due to splenomegaly occurs in 20-25% of patients. Presence of pallor Episodes of upper G. I. bleeding may lead to anemia. Poal hypertension is defined as free poal vein pressure in excess of the normal 5-10 mm Hg. In western countries cirrhosis of the liver accounts for more than 90% cases of poal hypertension. \"However in developing countries Noncirrhotic poal hypertension constitutes nearly 50% of all cases of poal hypertension\" The two most common causes of Noncirrhotic poal hypertension are: -- Non cirrhotic poal fibrosise (NCPF) - Extrahepatic poal vein obstructions (EHPVO) More on EHPVO and NCPF NCPF is characterized by the presence of a \"patent splenopoal axis\" demonstrable at ultrasonography and no evidence of cirrhosis on liver biopsy in a patient with poal hypertension. These patients present with repeated hematemesis. EHPVO on the other hand is generally diagnosed in a young adult presenting with repeated hematemesis and evidence of occlusion in the main poal vein with \"poal cavernoma\" formation. Extrahepatic poal vein obstruction (EHPVO) Second common cause of poal hypertension Defined as Obstruction of the extrahepatic poal vein with / without involvement of intrahepatic poal veins / splenic / SMV Occurs when site of block is in Poal vein before it reaches liver Prevalence Poal hypertension due to EHPVO: - Developed countries - 5 -10 % - Developing countries - 15- 20% - Children --> 80 -- 90% Most common cause of UGIB in Children Etiology Causes of extraheptatic poal vein obstruction Idiopathic Poosplenic vein inflammation or injury - Umbilical sepsis - Umbilical catheterization - Neonatal peritonitis - Abdominal trauma - latrogenic operative trauma to the poal vein Indirect causes Neonatal systemic sepsis from nonintra- abdominal sources - Dehydration - Multiple exchange transfusions Hypercoagulable states. Drugs Pregnancy Congenital abnormalities - Poal vein stenosis - Poal vein atresia or agenesis. Pathology On gross examination, the original poal vein is difficult to identify as it is replaced by a cluster of variable -- sized vessels, arranged haphazardly within a connective tissue suppo. \"Cavernous' malformation of protalvein\" On histological examination, - The architectural pattern of the liver is preserved - Liver biopsy is necessary in a patient with El. IPV0 if the liver functions are deranged. - Role of liver biopsy is limited but is used to exclude other liver disease. Hemodynamics of EHPVO Hepatic vein pressure gradient is normal in EHPVO Intravariceal and intrasplenic pressures closely reflect poal pressure - These are elevated in EHPVO patients and suggest poal hypertension Diagnosis of Ell. PV0 Imaging -EHPVO is diagnosed by imaging techniques such as Doppler US, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). which demonstrate poal vein obstruction, presence of intraluntinal thrombus in the poal vein and / or \"poal vein cavernoma\" Liver Biopsy -The role of liver biopsy in the diagnosis of EHPVO is limited, as mentioned above Non cirrhotic poal fibrosis (NCPF) It is a disease of unceain etiology characterized by poal. ftbrosis and involvement of small and medium brunches of poal veins -poal hypertension. The liver functions and structure primarily remain normal. Epidemiology of NCPF It is universally present but more common in developing countries than developed countries More prevalent in low socio-economic groups The peak age of incidence is 3rd-4th decade Etio- pathogenesis A number of hypotheses have been proposed Infections: - Septic poal circulation throhi may have a role to play as thrombin may activate stellate cells Xenobiotics exposure: Prolonged exposure may lead to NCPF. - Inorganic Arsenic exposure may play a role, however. the mechanism is poorly understood. Immunologic abnormalities: In comparison to controls - The total peripheral T lymphocytes (TI) and suppressor/ cytotoxic (T8) lymphocytes are decreased - The ratio of T4 to T8 lymphocytes is high. - The Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and TNF- receptor I & 11 are high in IPH. - TNF is involved in the induction and maintenance of fibrosis Clinical Presentation of NCPF Patients present with well tolerated episodes of GI hemorrhageQ Mass in left hypochondrium, splenomegalyQ AscitesQ and jaundicee may transiently develop during GI bleeding episode Natural history of NCPF There may slowly developing liver atrophy but liver functions are maintained GI bleeding is still the major cause of death. The life expectancy is longer than cirrhotics but lower than healthy controls Up to 100% 5 Years survival is expected provided varices are eradicated. Hemodynamics in NCPF WHVP is usually normal or mildly increased Poal pressures are elevated significantly Infra - variceal pressure is high and reflects poal pressures in NCPF Diagnosis of NCPF Poal hypertension related GI bleeding Splenomegaly without chronic liver disease Growth retardation No evidence of decompensated chronic liver disease Absence of viral/ other etiology of chronic liver diseases Prevalence of Varices and Variceal bleeding risk Esophago-gastric varices are present in 85- 95% cases Gastric varices are common in NCPF than in cirrhosis (up to 44% of cases) 70% of patients present with variceal bleeding NCPF may constitute up to 15% of poal hypertension related bleed. NCPF Vs EHPVO NCPF and EHPVO are similar in all aspects except the. following two points:?

No distinct benefit from the use of colloids have been demonstrated and in trauma patients, it is associated with a higher moality. The infusion of 2 to 3 lt. over 20 to 30 min should restore normal hemodynamic parameters. Continued hemodynamic instability implies that shock has not been reversed and/or that there are significant ongoing blood or volume losses. Continued blood loss, with hemoglobin concentration declining to 10 g/dl should initiate blood transfusion. In the presence of severe and for prolonged hypovolemia, inotropic suppo with dopamine vasopressin or dobutamine may be required to maintain adequate ventricular performance, after blood volume has been restored. Infusion of norepinephrine to increase aerial pressure by raising peripheral resistance is inappropriate, other than as a temporizing measure in severe shock while blood volume is reexpanded. \"",

C: Manage conservatively with antibiotics alone Infection complicating pancreatic necrosis leads to persisting sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and accounts for about half the deaths that occur following acute pancreatitis. Severe cases due to gallstones require urgent endoscopic sphincterotomy. Patients with pancreatic necrosis should be followed with serial contrast enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) and if infection is suspected fine needle aspiration of the necrotic area for bacteriology (FNAB) should be undeaken. If the aspirate is purulent, percutaneous drainage of the infected fluid should be carried out. In the presence of infection and worsening of sepsis despite percutaneous drainage, necrosectomy is indicated. Although traditionally this has been by open surgery, minimally invasive procedures are a promising new alternative. There are many unresolved issues in the management of pancreatic necrosis.

Campbell's Urology writes- \"In summary, for patients harboring nonstaghorn stones smaller than 10 mm, SWL is usually the primary approach. For patients with stones between 10 and 20 mm, SWL can still be considered a first-line treatment unless factors of stone composition, location, or renal anatomy suggest that a more optimal outcome may be achieved with a more invasive treatment modality (PNL or ureteroscopy). Patients with stones larger than 20 mm should primarily be treated by PNL unless specific indications for ureteroscopy are present (e. g., bleeding diathesis, obesity). \" Spontaneous passage of stones - Most stones <5 mm in diameter pass spontaneously. For stones larger than 5 nun in diameter, there is a progressive decrease in the spontaneous passage rate, which is unlikely with stones >10 mm in diameter. The choice of intervention for stones that are unlikely to pass spontaneously varies with the location and size of the stone. Three minimally invasive surgical techniques currently available are: Shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) Rigid and flexible ureteroscopy (URS) Also know Steinstrasse literally means 'stone street' it is condition which follows the use of ESWL. small pieces of fragmented calculi collect and obstruct in the distal ureter, like sand occluding a straw.",

Significant amounts of fluid may be absorbed during a TURP, especially if venous sinuses are opened early or when the operation is prolonged. On average during a TURP, approximately 20 mL of fluid per minute is absorbed, or approximately 1000-1200 mL in the first hour of resecting time. One third of this fluid is absorbed directly into the venous system. This may lead to dilutional hyponatremia (TUR syndrome), which causes mental confusion, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, hemolysis, hemoglobin nephropathy, coma, and shock. Symptoms of TUR syndrome generally do not occur until the serum sodium level has decreased to 125 m. Eq or less. There will be clonus and positive Babinski responses. Papilloedema, with dilated, sluggishly reacting pupils can occur. The EEG will show low voltage, bilaterally. Hemodynamically, this is characterized initially by increased central venous pressures, hypertension, bradycardia, and other signs of early vascular overload, including restlessness, tachypnea, and sometimes dusky skin changes of the conjunctiva, mucous membranes, or fingernails.

Diagnosis of myaesthenia gravis Several special diagnostic Tests for mysthenia gravis Electrophysiological Testing: (Repetitive nerve stimulation test) * Characteristic of myasthenia on electrophysiological testing is rapid reduction in the amplitude of muscle action potentials evoked during a series of repetitive stimulations of a peripheral nerve at a rate of 3 per second (decrementing response) * The traditional and simple method is to stimulate the nerve at 3 Hz and to measure the compound muscle action potential (a decrement of more than 10% when comparing the fifth to the first response is abnormal) Single fibre electromyography * This is more sensitive but technically more difficult than electrophysiological testing * Confirmatory but not specific. * This technique demonstrates an inconstancy in the firing of fibres connected to the same motor unit or a blocking of successive discharges from single muscle fibre belonging to the same motor unit. Edrophonium and Neostigmine test/Tensilon test * When edrophonium and neostigmine are given intravenously, it produces a transient improvement in strength in patients with myasthenia. * Edrophonium and neostigmine are anti cholinesterase so they prolong and exaggerate the effect of acetylcholine in the synapse and therefore provide an increment in muscle power in patient with myasthenia, * It is highly sensitive with 85%2 sensitivity in ocular and 95%e sensitivity in systemic myaesthenia. Measurement of receptor antibodies in the blood:... * * Measurement of antiacetylclzoline receptor antibodies provides a sensitive and highly specific test for the diagnosis of myasthenia. Presence of Ach antibodies is viually diagnostic of Myaesthenia graves. * Sensitivity is limited to about 50% in purely occular myasthenia and about 85% in generalized myasthenia. * Definitive if positive but negative test does not rules out the diagnosisdeg. The question has specifically asked which test would be most useful \"to diagnose\" myaesthenia gravis. The electrophysiological tests such as EMG and repetitive nerve stimulation test are quite sensitive test used for the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, but they are not diagnostic. Abnormality in these tests denotes some defect in neuromuscular conduction. It does not mean that these neuromuscular conduction defects are due to myasthenia gravis.

        "exp": "Ans. C: Sliding hernia. Indirect inguinal hernia. An indirect inguinal hernia follows the tract through the inguinal canal. This results from a persistent process vaginalis. The inguinal canal begins in the intra-abdominal cavity at the internal inguinal ring, located approximately midway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior iliac spine. The canal courses down along the inguinal ligament to the external ring, located medial to the inferior epigastric aeries, subcutaneously and slightly above the pubic tubercle. Contents of this hernia then follow the tract of the testicle down into the scrotal sac. Direct herniaA direct inguinal hernia usually occurs due to a defect or weakness in the transversalis fascia area of the Hesselbach triangle. The triangle is defined inferiorly by the inguinal ligament, laterally by the inferior epigastric aeries, and medially by the conjoined tendon. Femoral hernia. The femoral hernia follows the tract below the inguinal ligament through the femoral canal. The canal lies medial to the femoral vein and lateral to the lacunar (Gimbernat) ligament. Because femoral hernias protrude through such a small defined space, they frequently become incarcerated or strangulated. Umbilical hernia. The umbilical hernia occurs through the umbilical fibromuscular ring, which usually obliterates by 2 years of age. They are congenital in origin and are repaired if they persist in children older than age 2-4 years. Richter hernia. The Richter hernia occurs when only the antimesenteric border of the bowel herniates through the fascial defect. The Richter hernia involves only a poion of the circumference of the bowel. As such, the bowel may not be obstructed, even if the hernia is incarcerated or strangulated, and the patient may not present with vomiting. The Richter hernia can occur with any of the various abdominal hernias and is paicularly dangerous, as a poion of strangulated bowel may be reduced unknowingly into the abdominal cavity, leading to perforation and peritonitis Incisional hernia. This iatrogenic hernia occurs in 2-10% of all abdominal operations secondary to breakdown of the fascial closure of prior surgery. Even after repair, recurrence rates approach 20-45%. Spigelian hernia. This rare form of abdominal wall hernia occurs through a defect in the spigelian fascia, which is defined by the lateral edge of the rectus muscle at the arcuate line (costal arch to the pubic tubercle). Obturator hernia. This hernia passes through the obturator foramen, following the path of the obturator nerves and muscles. Obturator hernias occur with a female-to-male ratio of 6: 1, because of a gender-specific larger canal diameter. Because of its anatomic position, this hernia presents more commonly as a bowel obstruction than as a protrusion of bowel contents. Sliding hernia. As a result of slipping of the posterior parietal peritoneum on the underlying retroperitoneal structures, the posterior wall of the sac is not formed of peritoneum alone, but by the sigmoid colon and its mesentery on the left, the caecum on the right and, sometimes on either side by a poion of the bladder.",

The goal is eradication of micrometastatic disease, with the intent of preventing recurrances. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy - Neoadjuvant therapy, in contrast to adjuvant chemotherapy, is given before surgery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used as the primary treatment in patients who present with localized cancer for which local therapies, such as surgery and/or radiation, exist but are less than completely effective. One of the major advantages of neoadjuvant therapy is to reduce the size of the primary tumor such that it allows the surgeon a better chance of complete resection while reducing the potential spread of micrometastatic spread. Moreover, in the case of laryngeal cancer, anal cancer, osteosarcoma, and bladder cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may allow for preservation of vital organs such as the larynx, anal sphincter, limbs, and bladder, respectively.",

The tear is paial thickness, extends through the mucosa and submucosa, but not through the muscular layer. The clinical picture consists of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding following bout of retching. The mean age of the patient is 60 years and 80% of them are males. Majority of patients are alcoholics. Other frequent associations with mallory weiss tear are hiatal hernia, NSAIDS abuse and disease related bleeding diathesis. Management: In majority of patients (90%) bleeding stops spontaneously and only suppoive therapy is required. Persistent bleeding is managed by endoscopic electrocoagulation if it fails angiographic techniques are used and if it fails surgery (laparotomy with high gastrotomy with oversewing of the linear tear) is done. Also know: Boerhaave's syndrome: In this syndrome tear is full thickness penetrating completely through all the layers of esophageal wall with spillage of contents into the mediastinum. Sengstaken - blakemore tube will not be able to stop bleeding from mallory weiss as the bleeding is aerial and the pressure in the balloon is not sufficient to overcome the aerial pressure.

It has been associated with: Hepatic fibrosis Hepatocellular carcinoma Cholangiosarcoma Angiosarcoma Aflatoxin has been mentioned as the most potent ubiquitous natural chemical carcinogen. It is a product of the Aspergillus fungus, called aflatoxin B1. This mould and aflatoxin products can be found in grains stored in hot, humid places, where peanuts and rice are stored in non refrigerated conditions. Aflatoxin contamination of foodstuffs correlates with incidence rates in Africa and to some extent in China. Option 1 AFP levels > 500 microgram/liter are found in about 70% to 80% of cases. Lower levels may be found in patients with large metastasis from gastric or colonic tumors and in some patients with acute or chronic hepatitis. Option 3 Percutaneous liver biopsy under USG or CT guidance can be diagnostic, but there is a risk of hemorrhage as these tumors are highly vascular. Option 2 Because of multicentricity, bilobar involvement, poal vein invasion, and lymphatic metastasis only 15-20% of hepatocellular carcinoma are resectable.

Development of generalized edema beneath a nonyielding eschar impedes venous outflow and eventually affects aerial inflow to the distal beds. This can be recognized by numbness and tingling in the limb and increased pain in the digits. Aerial flow can be assessed by determination of Doppler signals in the digital aeries and the palmar and plantar arches in affected extremities. Capillary refill can also be assessed. Extremities at risk are identified either on clinical examination or on measurement of tissue pressures greater than 40 mm Hg. These extremities require escharotomies, which are releases of the burn eschar performed at the bedside by incising the lateral and medial aspects of the extremity with a scalpel or electrocautery unit. The entire constricting eschar must be incised longitudinally to completely relieve the impediment to blood flow. The incisions are carried down onto the thenar and hypothenar eminences and along the dorsolateral sides of the digits to completely open the hand, if it is involved. If it is clear that the wound will require excision and grafting because of its depth, escharotomies are safest to restore perfusion to the underlying non burned tissues until formal excision.

D: Anterior and posterior tibial aery Buerger disease, a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease also known as thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), is characterized by the absence or minimal presence of atheromas, segmental vascular inflammation, vasoocclusive phenomenon, and involvement of small and medium-sized aeries (plantar, tibial, radial etc.) and veins of the upper and lower extremities. The condition is strongly associated with heavy tobacco use, and progression of the disease is closely linked to continued use. The typical presentations are rest pain, unremitting ischemic ulcerations, and gangrene of the digits of hands and feet, and as the disease evolves, the patients may require several surgical amputations. Olin (2000) proposes the following criteria: Age younger than 45 years Current (or recent) history of tobacco use Presence of distal extremity ischemia (indicated by claudication, pain at rest, ischemic ulcers or gangrene) documented by noninvasive vascular testing such as ultrasound Exclusion of other autoimmune diseases, hypercoagulable states, and diabetes mellitus by laboratory tests.

Fractures across the growth plate may produce bony bridges that will cause premature cessation of growth or angular deformities of the extremity.

Epiphysial fractures around the shoulder, wrist, and fingers can usually be treated by closed reduction, but fractures of the epiphyses around the elbow often require open reduction. In the lower extremity, accurate reduction of the epiphysial plate is necessary to prevent joint deformity when a joint surface is involved.

Investigations: Barium swallow shows a dilated esophagus with poor emptying, an air fluid level and tapering at LES giving a bird beak appearence. Esophageal manometry shows impaired LES relaxation and absent peristalsis. Management: Pharmacologic therapy: Drugs which are temporarily used to relieve the LES pressure are: nitrates, calcium channel blockers or botulinum toxin. Surgical procedures: Pneumatic dilatation and Heller's myotomy are the only durable therapies. Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th Edition chapter 292.",

Limit foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol; and substitute unsaturated fat from vegetables, fish, legumes, nuts. Limit salt and alcohol; maintain a healthy body weight and a diet with emphasis on vegetables, fruits, and low-fat or non-fat dairy products. AHA Guidelines about the Riven options: About n-3 Fatty Acid Supplements A number of investigators have repoed on beneficial effects of increased fatty acid intake in patients with coronary aery disease. Several of these studies used supplements containing long-chain fatty acids (EPA and DHA, or ''fish oil\") at doses ranging from 850 mg to 2. 9 g/d. Other studies have shown that higher doses (3 to 4 g/d) provided as supplements can reduce plasma triglyceride levels in patients with hyperiglyceridemia. 21 High intakes of fatty fish (1 serving per day) can result in intakes of EPA and DHA of: 1%.-900 mg/d. Fuher studies are needed to establish optimal doses of fatty acids (including EPA, DHA, and rr-linolenic acid) for both primary and secondary prevention of coronary disease as well as the treatment of hyperiglyceridemia. For secondary prevention, beneficial effects of a high dose of fatty acids on recurrent events have been repoed in the GISSI trial. A 20% reduction in overall moality (P=0. 01) and a 45% reduction in sudden death (P<0. 05) after 3. 5 years was repoed in subjects with preexisting coronary heart disease (who were being treated with conventional drugs) given 850 mg of fatty acid ethyl esters (as EPA and DHA) either with or without vitamin E (300 mg/d). Other studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of fatty acids EPA, DHA (1. 9 g/d), 2 u-and:/-linolenic acid (0. 8% of energy)ll 71 in subjects with coronary heart disease. Consumption of 1 fatty fish meal per day (or alternatively, a fish oil supplement) could result in an fatty acid intake (ie, EPA and DHA) of kc900 mg/d, an amount shown to beneficially affect coronary heart disease moality rates in patients with coronary disease. About high fibre diet The AHA recommendation is to increase fiber intake in the diet. This goal can be achieved through the guidelines for food consumption, for example, emphasis on vegetables, cereals, grains, and fruits. Although there are studies showing that specific fiber supplements are associated with lowered LDL or glucose, there are no long-term trials showing relations between these supplements and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, at this time, fiber supplements are not recommended for heart disease risk reduction. About Stanol/Sterol Ester-Containing Foods Stanol/sterol ester (plant sterols)-containing foods have been documented to decrease plasma cholesterol levels. Plant sterols, as a class of compounds, are poorly absorbed and appear to compete with cholesterol for absorption, hence decreasing the efficacy of absorption. Intakes of 2 to 3 g of plant sterols per day have been repoed to decrease total and LDL cholesterol levels by 9% to 20%. Considerable variability in response exists among individuals. Little effect of plant sterols on HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels has been repoed. Intakes of plant sterols >3 g/d confer no additional benefit with respect to total or LDL cholesterol lowering. Plasma levels of plant sterols are not or only minimally elevated after daily ingestion. Recent concern has been raised regarding the tendency of plant sterol-containing foods to decrease plasma fx- plus 13-carotene, Lr-tocopherol, and/or lycopene levels. The physiological significance of these changes is unclear at this time, but it appears prudent to recommend additional monitoring. Until long-term studies are performed to ensure the absence of adverse effects in individuals chronically ingesting plant sterol-containing foods, the use of these products should be reserved for adults requiring lowering of total and LDL cholesterol levels because of hypercholesterolemia or the need for secondary prevention after an atherosclerotic event. About Potassium Supplement A recent meta-analysis found that on average, supplementation of diets with 60 to 120 mmol of potassium per day reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, by 4. 4 and 2. 5 mm Hg in hypeensives and by 1. 8 and 1. 0 mm Hg in normotensives. Diets rich in potassium have also been associated with a reduced risk of stroke. Because a high dietary intake of potassium, magnesium, and calcium can he achieved from food sources and because diets rich in these minerals provide a variety of other nutrients, the preferred strategy for increasing mineral intake is through foods rather than supplements.

The remaining esophagus is connected to the stomach in the neck (cervical esophagogastric anastomosis). Advantages of Transhiatal esophagectomy over transthoracic esophagectomy: The two leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the first few days after a transthoracic esophagectomy are Lung complications (especially pneumonia) associated with a large operation that requires opening both the chest and the abdomen. The pain of these combined incisions may make it difficult for the patient to take a deep breath early after the operation, and this allows pneumonia to set in; and Severe infection in the chest (mediastinitis) resulting due to a \"leak\" from the intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis. After a THE, because the patient has not had the chest opened, there is less pain early after surgery, the patient can move about better as a result, and lung complications are less.

When vomiting imposes a risk of aspiration, as in the case of an obtunded or comatose patient or in the case of impending seizures precipitated by the ingested drug, syrup of ipecac is contraindicated. Hydrocarbons such as mineral oil have a low viscosity and surface tension; the latter propey accounts for the spreading tendency of the product and the potential for aspiration. Very minute amounts of aspirated hydrocarbon can cause a necrotizing pneumonia. Syrup of ipecac should be used only when the primary toxicity of the hydrocarbon is systemic, as, for example, with carbon tetrachloride or benzene. Administration of activated charcoal alone without prior gut emptying is being used for ceain ingestions.

The WASP protein encoded by this gene is expressed in cell of all hematopoietic lineage but paicuarly in platelets and T lymphocytes. WASP deficient platelets are small and have a shoened half life. Patients with this defect uniformly have an impaired humoral immune responses' to polysaccharide antigens as evidenced by absent or markedly diminished isohemagglutinin and poor or absent antibody responses after immunization with polysaccharide vaccine.

If not treated, the chancre will disappear and the patient will be asymptomatic until he/she exhibits the signs/symptoms of secondary syphilis, which include a disseminated rash and systemic involvement such as meningitis, hepatitis, or nephritis. There are two kinds of tests for the detection of syphilis antibodies: non- specific tests such as the RPR and VORL, and specific tests such as the FT A, TPHA (T pallidum hemagglutination test), and the MHTP (microhemagglutination-T pallidum). The difference is that the nonspecific tests use a cross- reactive antigen known as cardiolipin, while the specific tests use a T pallidum antigen. Although the nonspecific tests are sensitive, they lack specificity and often cross- react in patients who have diabetes, hepatitis, or infectious mononucleosis, or who are pregnant. Some patients, especially those with autoimmune diseases, will have both nonspecific (RPR) and specific tests (FTA) positive even if they do not have syphilis.

Colle's fracture Colle's fracture is an extra-aicular fracture at the distal end of radius, at its coico-cancellous junction. It is the most common fracture in person over 40 years of age and especially in women after menopause (Postmenopausal females). The association of the fracture with osteoporosis is now well established and it is one of the fragility fracture, seen in osteoporosis. The fracture nearly always caused by fall on outstretched hand. Displacement in colle's fracture The fracture line runs transversely at the coico-cancellous junction. In the majority of the cases, one or more displacements of the distal fragment occur:- Dorsal displacement (Dorsal shift) i Dorsal tilt (Dorsal angulation) Lateral displacement (lateral shift) Clinical features of colles fracture Lateral tilt (lateral angulation) Supination (external rotation) Impaction (proximal migration) Pain and swelling at the wrist. Typical deformity: There is a dorsal hollow or depression just proximal to the fracture and immediately distal to this there is a marked prominence caused by lower fragment being displaced backwards, carrying with it the whole of the carpus and hand. This gives appearance of a fork, So named dinner fork/ silver fork /spoon shaped deformity. There is local tenderness. Treatment of colle's fracture Treatment of colle's fracture is essentially conservative. For undisplaced fracture below-elbow cast is given in-situ. For displaced fractures, the standard method of treatment is to undeake manipulative reduction under local or general anaesthesia. Technique of closed manipulation involves reversing the typical deformities of colle's fracture (in following sequence):- Disimpaction (by traction):- to correct impaction. Palmer flexion & ulnar detion:- to correct dorsal tilt / shift and radial tilt / shift. Pronation (internal rotation):- to correct supination (external rotation).

        "question": "Desmoid tumor, treatment is:",
        "exp": "Desmoid tumors, also known as \"aggressive fibromatosis, \" are soft tissue lesions that behave similarly to other truncal soft tissue sarcomas but have unique characteristics. These tumors, like other soft tissue sarcomas, present as slow-growing, indolent masses (sometimes can be aggressive). Unlike typical sarcomas however, these tumors rarely metastasize. Desmoids are diffusely infiltrative and tend to recur locally, even after complete resection.. Most desmoid tumors arise sporadically, but a small percentage (-5%) occurs in association with FAP syndrome. Desmoids are classified as either abdominal or extra-abdominal. Abdominal desmoids are categorized further as superficial or infra-abdominal tumors. The superficial disease, also known as Dupuytren's fibromatosis, is slow growing, is small in size, and rarely involves deeper structures. Most of the intra-abdominal lesions are seen in association with FAP. These lesions are associated with mutations in the APC gene that are found in patients who have FAP. These tumors usually are found in the mesentery, and their growth and compression of neighboring structures can lead to significant morbidity and sometimes even death in these patients Sporadic abdominal wall desmoid tumors have been found to be associated with pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use has also been associated with the occurrence of these tumors. These associations, combined with the detection of estrogen receptors within the tumor, suggest a regulatory role for estrogen in this disease. Tissue injury, such as trauma and/or surgery, also has been implicated in tumor development. The natural history of desmoid lesions is unpredictable. Although most are indolent and slow growing, some lesions are aggressive. There are some reports of spontaneous regression, but such occurrences are mainly in women and are associated with chemical or surgical menopause. Most lesions are indolent and have benign-appearing histology, but local growth and compression have caused significant morbidity. Involvement of abdominal vessels and organs often complicates management. Patients with desmoid tumors present with a painless enlarging mass. Local symptoms may arise from compression of adjacent organs or neurovascular structures. MRI is done to define the extent of disease and its relationship with other structures. Incisional biopsy or a core needle biopsy is done to confirm the diagnosis. Management: Surgery with wide negative margins is the best treatment. Unfortunately, even with complete resection, the local recurrence rate is as high as 40%. Surgery is also the t/t of choice for recurrences. For tumors where vital visceral organs and local infiltration often make achieving negative margins difficult, other therapeutic modalities have been suggested. Antiproliferative agents and cytotoxic chemotherapy have been used to palliate these tumors with variable results. The two most widely used groups of noncytotoxic drugs are NSAIDs (such as sulindac and indomethacin) and antiestrogens(such as tamoxifen). Chemotherapy has generally been reserved for unresectable, symptomatic, and clinically aggressive disease. Partial responses have been observed after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin C, dacarbazine, or carboplatin, although toxicity has been relatively high. Radiotherapy-\"The role of radiation therapy in the management of these tumors, either as an adjunct to surgery or as primary treatment, continues to be defined. \" - Sabiston \"In summary, for easily resectable disease, surgery alone appears to be the optimal approach, especially in patients with negative microscopic margins. In advanced cases, a trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or hormonal therapy can be considered in most patients. A period of close observation is also reasonable because some patients demonstrate regression without any therapy. However, if a patient is symptomatic and not a candidate for surgery, consideration should be given to radiation or chemotherapy to increase the chance of a response. \"-Devita Oncology",

How does blockade of fi receptors help in heart failure?? Left ventricular dysfunction results in neurohormonal activation (renin angiotensin aldosterone system, sympathetic system, cytokine release) which, although beneficial in acute cases is reponsible for gradual deterioration in myocardial function. For instance, in response to decrease in cardiac output, an increase in circulating norepinephrine (NE) can be seen which acts on the sympathetic myocardial receptors paicularly beta-1 thus increasing tnyocardial contractility. In addition, by stimulating peripheral alpha receptor, NE induces peripheral vasoconstriction, which helps to maintain blood pressure - This effect is counter balanced by peripheral *to-2 stimulation and consequent vasodilation. Prolonged exposure of hea to alpha and beta receptor stimulation unfounately, promotes left ventricular modelling, cell death due to necrosis or apoptosis and water/ salt retention. 8 blockers interfere with the harmful effect of sustained activation of the adrenergic nervous system by competitively antagonizing one or more adrenergic receptors. When given along with ACE inhibitors beta blockers reverse the process of RV remodelling, improve patient symptoms, prevents hospitalisation and prolongs life. Therefore II blockers are indicated for patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic HF and depressed Ejection Fraction < 40%. There are three beta blockers that have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic HE: - Bisoprolol - Metoprolol - Carvedilol Current recommendation are to consider the addition of fl blockers in the case of patients presenting with functional class II or Ill congestive heart failure if caused by systolic function. Dose of 13eta blockers First of all, treatment should be staed at extremely low doses:? - This dosage should be maintained for at least two to. four weeks and is increased only if the patient has tolerated it well. - if the patient does not tolerate the increased dosage the medication should not be considered a failure and treatment should be maintained at the tolerated dose. - The dose of beta blocker should he increased, until, the dose, used are similar to those that have been repoed to be effective in clinical trials. Administering, 8 blockers may lead to worsening fluid retention consequent to the withdrawl of adrenergic suppo to the hea and the circulation. - Thus it is impoant to optimize the dose of diuretic before staing therapy with beta blockers. - The increased, fluid retention can usually be managed by increasing the dose of diuretics. Beta blockers in NYHA class IV:? Since most of the clinical trials of Beta blocking agents have been conducted in patients with heart failure NYHA. functional class 11/ HI, until recently, there was limited information regarding safety and efficacy of Beta blockers in patients with heart failure NYHA functional class IV.

It's the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. Male to female ratio is 3: 2. Approximately 60% of Meckel's diverticula contain heterotopic mucosa, of which more than 60% consists of gastric mucosa. Second most common ectopic mucosa is that of Pancreas (Pancreatic acini). Other mucosa are \u00adcolonic mucosa, Brunner's gland, pancreatic islets, endometriosis and hepatobiliary tissue. A useful but crude Mnemonic used traditionally for describing Meckel's diverticula is Rule of two: i. e. 2% prevalence 2 inch in length 2 feet proximal to ilcocecal valve. half of these who are symptomatic are younger than 2 yrs of age Meckel's diverticula are asymptomatic. Symptoms arise only when any complication occurs. Complications Most common complication in children & young adults (< 18 yrs of age) -> bleeding in adults -> intestinal obstruction overall -> bleeding Following complications are noted in Meckel's diverticulum. Bleeding bleeding in Meckel's diverticulum is usually the result of ulceration in ileal mucosa adjacent to the diverticulum caused by the acid secreted by heterotopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum. Intestinal obstruction Intestinal obstruction associated with Meckel's diverticulum can result from several mechanisms. Volvulus of the intestine around the fibrous band attaching the diverticulum to the umbilicus Intussusception with the diverticulum acting as the lead point. Entrapment of intestine by a mesodiverticular band (Mesodiverticular band is a remnant of left vitelline artery, it tethers the Meckel's diverticulum to the ileal mesentry.) Stricture secondary to chronic diverticulitis. Diverticulitis clinical picture is similar to appendicitis. diverticulitis may lead to perforation. Littre's hernia - rarely Meckel's diverticulum is found in inguinal or femoral hernia. This is known as Littre's hernia. Diagnostic studies Meckel's diverticulum in the absence of bleeding can be rarely diagnosed before surgical intervention. Barium meal follow through can rarely demonstrate the diverticulum. Barium enteroclysis can demonstrate the diverticula in 75% of cases but is avoided during acute presentation of complication. If repeated episodes of lower GI bleed occur and an ectopic gastric mucosa in the Meckel's diverticulum is suspected, it can be demonstrated by Technetium99 pertechnate radionuclide scan. It demonstrates the ectopic gastric mucosa and localizes the Meckel's diverticulum. Angiography can localize the site of bleeding during acute hemorrhage related to meckel's diverticula.",

Features of chronic lymphoedema of limb Initially the lymphoedema is soft and pits on pressure but with time the skin becomes thickened & non-pitting due to fibrosis, dermal thickening and hyperkeratosis. Frequent episodes of lymphangitis and cellulitis may occur. this is believed to be due to loss of local immune defence mechanism. Chronic eczema, fungal infection of skin (dermatophytosis) and nails (onychomycosis), fissuring, verrucae and papillae (was) are frequently seen in advanced disease.

It aims at blocking the action of estrogen on estrogen receptor positive breast cells. The hormonal therapy of choice for breast cancer in premenopausal women is Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen belongs to class of drugs known as \"Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator\". Tamoxifen binds to the estrogen receptors on tumours and blocks the effect of estrogen on these cells. Tamoxifen is only effective in treating estrogen receptor positive breast cancers. - Therefore the tumour's hormone receptor status should be determined before deciding on treatment option for breast cancer. Tamoxifen is used to treat patients with early stage breast cancer as well as those with metastatic breast cancer Adjuvant therapy with Tamoxifen - Chemotherapy after primary t/t to increase the chance of cure. It helps in preventing the recurrence and also helps to prevent the development of new cancers in the other breast. When used as adjuvant chemotherapy it is usually taken for 5 years. When taken for 5 years if reduces the chance of the original breast cancer coming back in the same breast or elsewhere. It also reduces the risk of developing secondary primary cancer.

Ghai - \"Operative correction of VUR is indicated in pts. with -persistent severe (grade IV or V) reflux\". This statement does not mean that any pt. with grade IV & V reflux will be given surgical management and rest medical management. Treatment is not so clear-cut. The choice b/w medical or surgical modality is based on ceain principles (go through the following text to understand it). The below given explanation is a bit lengthy. Bear with me for giving such a long text, as it is one of the most impoant but less read topic (UG books do not give sufficient information on its treatment). This explanation will help you to tackle any future question on t/t of VUR with different patient profile (as t/t changes with grades as well as age of the patient) Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the ureter and the renal pelvis Grading of VUR: is based on the appearance of the urinary tract on Micturating Cystourethrograni reflux into a non-dilated ureter Grade I Grade II reflux into the upper collecting system without dilatation. Grade HI reflux into dilated ureter and /or blunting of calyceal fornices Grade IV reflux into a grossly dilated ureter Grade V Gross dilatation of the ureter, renal pelvis & calyces: calyces show loss of papillary impression. Complications of VUR Reflux predisposes to renal infection (pyelonephritis) by facilitating the transpo of bacteria from the bladder to the upper urinary tract. The inflammatory reaction caused by a pyelonephritic infection may result in renal injury or scarring. Extensive renal scarring impair renal function and may result in renin mediated hypertension, reflux nephropathy, renal insufficiency, end stage renal disease, reduced somatic growth and morbidity during pregnancy. Treatment The goals of t/t are to prevent pyelonephritis, renal injury, and other complication of reflux. Treatment modality is either medical or surgical. Medical therapy - is based on the principle that reflux often resolves over time and the antibiotics maintain urine sterility and prevent infection and complication while awaiting spontaneous resolution. Surgical therapy: - the basis for surgical therapy is that in selected children, ongoing reflux has caused or has significant potential for causing renal injury. The decision to do medical or surgical t/t is based on ceain principles and parental, patient preferences. Below is given a cha listing the treatment recommendation for VUR. Before going through the cha lets see the basic principles on which this cha is based? With bladder growth and maturation, there is tendency for reflux to resolve or improve over time. Lower grades of reflux are much more likely to resolve than are higher grades. For grades I & II reflux, the likelihood of resolution is similar irrespective of age at diagnosis and whetner if it unilateral or bilateral. For grade III & IV a younger age at diagnosis and unilateral reflux generally are associated with a higher rate of spontaneous resolution. Grade V reflux rarely resolves. The mean age for reflux resolution is 6 - 7 yrs. Reflux is unlikely to cause any renal injury in the absence of infection.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Brilliantly translucent Cystic hygromas are fluid-filled sacs that result from a blockage in the lymphatic system and are lined by single layer of epithelium. Cystic hygromas are single or multiple cysts found mostly in the neck region. Swelling may be bilateral and is soft and paially compressible, visibly increasing in size when the child cough or cries. The characteristic that distinguishes it from all other swelling of the neck is that it is brilliantly translucent. A cystic hygroma can be present as a bih defect (congenital) or develop at any time life. A cystic hygroma in a developing baby can progress to hydrops (an excess amount of fluid in the body) and eventually fetal death. Some cases of congenital cystic hygromas resolve leading to webbed neck, edema (swelling), and a lymphangioma (a benign yellowish-tan tumor on the skin composed of swollen lymph vessels). In other instances the hygroma can progress in size to become larger than the fetus. Cystic hygromas occur in approximately 1% of fetuses between weeks 9 and 16 of pregnancy. Definitive management is complete excision of the cyst at an early stage. Injection of the sclerosing agent (picibanil) may reduce the size of the cyst.",

        "exp": "Answer is 'a' i. e. No passage of gas absolutely (obstipation); 'b' i. e. No passage of stools absolutely; 'c' i. e. Distention of abdomen Colonic obstruction may occur in any poion of the colon, but most commonly is seen in the sigmoid colon. Obstruction at the ileocecal valve produces symptoms and signs of small bowel obstruction. So do obstruction in proximal asc. colon if the ileo-cecal valve becomes incompetent. The pathophysiology of more distal colonic obstruction depends on the competence of the ileocecal valve. If the ileocecal valve is incompetent the colonic pressure is relieved by reflux into the ileum. If the colon is not decompressed through the ileocecal valve, a 'closed loop' is formed between the valve and the obstructing point. The colon distends progressively because the ileum continues to empty gas and liquids into the obstructed segment. Increasing colonic pressure may lead to impaired circulation with gangren and perforation. The risk of perforation is highest in the cecum. Symptoms & signs - depend on the degree and acuity of obstruction, as well as on the cause. Abdominal distention is the most prominent initial finding. Pain is cramping in nature but of less severity than seen in small bowel obstruction. Vomiting is late and occurs only if the ileocecal valve is incompetent. Feculant vomiting is very rare (cf. feculant vomiting is seen in distal small bowel obstruction). Constipation or obstipation is a universal feature of complete obstruction, though the colon distal to the obstruction may empty after the initial symptom begins. So its a late feature even in complete obstruction. If ileocecal valve incompetence decompresses the colonic contents into the small intestine, features of both small & large intestine obstruction appears. Fever is commonly seen in acute diveiculitis, ischemic injury or perforation. (But I don't think its an early finding) Plain x-ray films will show peripheral gas filled dilated colon segments. Air fluids level will not be noted unless the ileocecal valve incompetence has decompressed the colonic contents into small intestine. Also know MC cause of colonic obstruction Ca colon",

A: Superior vena cava CVP is usually measured in Superior vena cava with the catheter inseed into a large vein in the neck (internal jugular vein), chest (subclan vein) or groin (femoral vein) known as central venous catheter (\"central line\", \"CVC\", \"central venous line\" or \"central venous access catheter\") It is used to administer medication or fluids, obtain blood tests (specifically the \"mixed venous oxygen saturation\"), and directly obtain cardiovascular measurements such as the central venous pressure, sometimes termed preload. Ceain medications, such as inotropes and amiodarone, are preferably given through a central line Site-Specific Complications Femoral vein: The most potentially serious complication is inadveent penetration of the peritoneal cavity or rectum. This complication can be avoided by ensuring the site of inseion is below the inguinal ligament and the needle is not directed too posteriorly or inseed too deeply. Internal Jugular vein: Cannulation of the IJ vein is also relatively safe but less so than femoral vein cannulation. As previously described, inadveent puncture of the carotid aery can be problematic. Accidental injury to the brachial plexus has also been described. The most impoant potential complication is accidental pneumothorax. Subclan vein: The location of the subclan vein is such that it is possible for the needle to inadveently penetrate the pleural space and create a pneumothorax. This complication occurs in up to 5% of attempted subclan line placements. More skilled operators have a lower incidence of this complication, so subclan cannulation is recommended only for those who have experience with this technique.",

Amongst indwelling vascular catheters, central venous catheters are the most common culprits. Pathogenesis There are four potential sources for catheter related infections? 1) The skin inseion site 2) The catheter hub 3) Hematogenous seeding from a distant infection 4) Contaminated infilsate The skin inseion site and the catheter hub are by for the two most impoant sources. Approximately 65% of catheter related infections originate from the skin flora, 30% from the contaminated hub and 5% from other pathways. For sho term catheters, skin contamination is the most likely mechani. sm of pathogenesis. On the other hand, for long term catheters, hub contamination is more frequent because such catheters often have to be intercepted and manipulated. Skin organisms migrate from the skin inseion site along the external surface of catheter, colonizing the distal intravascular tip of the catheter, and ultimately causing blood-stream infection. On the other hand, in hub related infections, organisms are usually introduced into the hub from the hands of medical personnel and the organisms migrate along the internal surface of the catheter, where they can cause a bloodstream infection. Microbiology Most of the micro-organisms implicated in CRIs arise from the skin flora. Staphylococci are the most frequently isolated pathogens, paricularly coagulase-negative staphylococci. Etiology of catheter related infection Microorganism Percentage * Coagulase negative staphylococci 30 - 40 * Staph aureus 5-10 * Enterococci 4 - 6 * Candida spp. 3 - 6 * Pseudonzonas aeruginosa 2 - 5 * Enterobacter spp 1 - 4 * Acinetobacter spp. 1 - 2 * Serratia spp. <1 * Others < 1 - 5",

There is also evidence to suppo the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with Anaplastic astrocytomas. Patients with primary malignant melanoma at high risk of metastases derive benefit in terms of improved disease-free survival and overall survival from adjuvant treatment with the biologic agent interferon-I+- although this treatment must be given for 1 year for optimal clinical efficacy. Finally, the antiestrogens tamoxifen and anastrozole are effective adjuvant agents in postmenopausal women whose breast tumors express the estrogen receptor. \" Adjuvant Chemotherapy: Indicated for (Ref- Devita's Oncology) Anaplastic astrocytoma Osteogenic sarcoma Breast cancer Pancreatic cancer Colorectal cancer Ovarian cancer Gastric cancer Head and neck cancer Melanoma Cervical cancer Non small cell lung cancer Wilm's tumor (Note that Harrison 17/e table 81. 1 lists only 4 cancers for adjuvant therapy i. e. --Breast, colon, osteogenic sarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma) Also know: Primary induction chemotherapy refers to drug therapy administered as the first treatment for patients who present with advanced cancer for which no alternative treatment exists.
