        "exp": "Ans) a (Cyst with....) Ref: http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/RanulaA ranula is a type of mucocele found on the floor of the mouth. Ranulas present as a swelling of connective tissue consisting of collected mucin from a ruptured salivary gland duct, which is usually caused by local trauma. The Latin rana means frog, and a ranula is so named because its appearance is sometimes compared to a frog's underbelly. An oral ranula is a fluctuant swelling with a bluish translucent color. If it is deeper it does not have this bluish appearance. If it is large (2 or more), it may hide the salivary gland and affect the location of the tongue. Most frequently it stems from the sublingual salivary gland, but also from the submandibular gland. Though normally above the mylohyoid muscle, if a ranula is found deeper in the floor of the mouth, it can appear to have a normal color. A ranula below the mylohyoid muscle is referred to as a \"plunging or cervical ranula\", and produces swelling of the neck with or without swelling in the floor of the mouth. Ranulas measure several centimeters in diameter and are usually larger than mucoceles. As a result, when ranulas are present the tongue may be elevated. As with mucoceles, ranulas may be subject to recurrent swelling with occasional rupturing of its contents. When pressed, they may not blanch. Ranulas may be asymptomatic, although they can fluctuate rapidly in size, shrinking and swelling, making most ranulas hard to detect. How-ever, if it gets large enough it may interfere with swallowing. The overly-ing mucosa is usually intact. The swelling is not fixed and is non-painful unless it becomes secondarily infected. Microscopically, ranulas are cystic saliva filled distensions of sali-vary gland ducts on the floor of the mouth alongside the tongue, and lack a true epithelium. Treatment of ranulas could involve either marsupialization or more often excision of both the gland and lesion. Ranulas are likely to recur if the sublingual gland or other gland causing them is not also removed with the lesion. There is little morbidity or mortality connected with treatment.",

Occurs in palatal midline behind the maxillary central incisors in the region of incisive canal. Usually asymptomatic; may be associated with salty discharge. Surgical enucleation via palatal flap is treatment of choice. Radicular cyst (Periapical cyst): Most common type of jaw cyst. Develops at the apex of an infected, nonvital tooth. Bimodal incidence within the 3rd and 6th decade. Rarely seen in primary dentition. Usually presents as radioluscent lesion around the apex of a tooth root. Lined by proliferative epithelium of the non-keratinizing type with an intense inflammatory infiltrate. Normally resolve spontaneously if the infection in the associated tooth is controlled by root canal therapy. For persisting and larger lesion: Enucleation.

Most consist of a mucus filled cyst that lies under the mucosa, just lateral to the frenulum. It is thought to be a retention cyst that arises from the obstruction of one of the several ducts draining the sublingual gland. It presents as an asymptomatic swelling of the floor of the mouth, but occasionally can get so large that it interferes with speech or eating. Treatment consists of uncapping and marsupialising it. Very occasionally, the ranula can penetrate through the mylohyoid muscle and into the neck, when it is known as a plunging ranula. This requires excision, as does a simple ranula if it recurs after uncapping. REF: Textbook of General and Oral Surgery by David Wray, David Stenhouse pahe 121. Minor mucous retention cysts develop in the floor of the mouth either from an obstructed minor salivary gland or from the sublingual salivary gland. The term ranula' should be applied only to a mucous extravasation cyst that arises from a sublingual gland. It produces a characteristic translucent swelling that takes on the appearance of a 'frog's belly' (ranula). A ranula can resolve spontaneously, but many also require formal surgical excision of the cyst and the affected sublingual gland. Incision and drainage, however tempting, usually results in recurrence. REF: Bailey & Loves 25th edition page 754",

Bailey & love, 25/e p737 (24th/e p706, 23/e p 639)) \" Submucous oral fibrosis is a progressive ds. in which fibrous bands form beneath the oral mucosa. These bands progressively contract so that ultimately mouth opening is severely limited. Tongue movements may also be limited. This condition is almost entirely confined to Asians. Histologically it is characterized by juxta epithelial fibrosis with atrophy or hyperplasia of the overlying epithelium which also shows areas of epithelial dysplasias. The etiology is obscure. Hypersensitivity to Chilli; betel nut, tobacco and vitamin deficiencies have been implicated. The scar bands of submucous fibrosis, which result in difficulty in opening can be treated either by intralesional injection of steroids or by surgical excision and grafting, but this has little effect in preventing the onset of squamous cell Ca in the generally atrophic oral mucosa (Submucous oral fibrosis is a precancerous conditon for squamons cell Ca)*. \"",

REF: Bailey 25th ed page 735 Box46. 2, Dhingra 4th ed page 209, Robbins 8th ed chapter 16, Das text book of surgery 3rd edition page 104, Rooks Textbook of Dermatology 4th Volume 8th ed page 52. 29-52. 37. The term leukoplakia is defined by the World Health Organization as \"a white patch or plaque that cannot be scraped off and cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically as any other disease. \" Simply put, if a white lesion in the oral cavity can be given a specific diagnosis it is not a leukoplakia. Thls clinical term is reserved for lesions that are present in the oral cavity for no apparent reason. Approximately 3% of the worlds population have leukoplakic lesions, and somewhere between 5% and 25% of these lesions are premalignant. Thus, until it is proved otherwise via histologic evaluation, all leukoplakias must be considered precancerous. The chances of leukoplakia becoming malignant are cited from 1 to 17, 5%. On an average about 5% become malignant, Erythroplakia represents a red, velvety, possibly eroded area within the oral cavity that usually remains level with or may be slightly depressed in relation to the surrounding mucosa. It is much less common than leukoplakia. The epithelium in such lesions tends to be markedly atypical, incurring a much higher risk of malignant transformation than that seen with leukoplakia, malignant potential is 17 times ofleukovlakia. Intermediate forms are occasionally encountered that have the characteristics of both leukoplakia and erythroplakia, termed speckled leukoerythroplakia. It has the highest rate of malignant transformation. (Bailey).
