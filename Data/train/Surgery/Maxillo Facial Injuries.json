        "exp": "Ans. (b) Orbital floor* Fracture of the orbital floor is the most common traumatic orbital fracture.* Eyebrow Ptosis after Blowout Fracture Indicates Impairment of Trigeminal Proprioceptive Evocation That Induces Reflex Contraction of the Frontalis Muscle.* The force of a blow to the orbit is dissipated by a fracture of the surrounding bone, usually the orbital floor and/ or the medial orbital wall. Serious consequences of such injury include diplopia in upgaze where there is significant damage to the orbital floor. In blowout fractures, the medial wall is fractured indirectly.* Fracture of the medial wall is more common than the floor, since the medial wall is slightly thinner (0. 25 mm vs 0. 50 mm). However; it is known that pure blowout fractures most frequently involve the orbital floor. This is due to the honeycomb structure of the numerous bony septa of the ethmoid sinuses, thus allowing it to withstand the sudden rise in intraorbital hydraulic pressure better than the orbital floor",

Fractures of Zygoma (Tripod Fracture): After nasal bones, zygoma is the secondmost frequently fractured bone. Usually, the cause is direct trauma. Fracture line passes through zygomaticofrontal suture, orbital floor, infraorbital margin and foramen, anterior wall of maxillary sinus and the zygomaticotemporal suture. Clinical Features:* Flattening of malar prominence.* Step-deformity of infraorbital margin.* Anesthesia in the distribution of infraorbital nerve.* Trismus, due to depression of zygoma on the underlying coronoid process.* Oblique palpebral fissure, due to the displacement of lateral palpebral ligament. Restricted ocular movements, due to entrapment of inferior rectus muscle. It may cause diplopia. Periorbital emphysema, due to escape of air from the maxillary sinus on nose-blowing. Diagnosis. Waters' or exaggerated Waters' view shows the fracture and displacement the best. Treatment. Only displaced fractures require treatment. Open reduction and internal wire fixation gives best results.",
