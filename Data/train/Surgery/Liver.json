        "question": "A 28-year-old previously healthy woman arrives in the emergency room complaining of 24 h of anorexia and nausea and lower abdominal pain that is more intense in the right lower quadrant than elsewhere. On examination she has peritoneal signs of the right lower quadrant and a rectal temperature of 38. 38degC (101. 8degF). At exploration through incision of the right lower quadrant, she is found to have a small, contained perforation of a cecal diverticulum. Which of the following statements regarding this situation is true?",
        "exp": "Cecal diverticula must be differentiated from the more common variety of diverticula that are usually found in the left colon. Cecal diverticula are thought to be a congenital entity. The cecal diverticulum is often solitary and involves all layers of the bowel wall; therefore, cecal diverticula are true diverticula. Diverticula elsewhere in the colon are almost always multiple and are thought to be an acquired disorder. These acquired diverticula are really herniations of mucosa through weakened areas of the muscularis propria of the colon wall. The preoperative diagnosis in the case of cecal diverticulitis is \"acute appendicitis\" about 80% of the time. If there is extensive inflammation involving much of the cecum, an ileocolectomy is indicated. If the inflammation is well localized to the area of the diverticulum, a simple diverticulectomy with closure of the defect is the procedure of choice. To avoid diagnostic confusion in the future, the appendix should be removed whenever an incision is made in the right lower quadrant, unless operatively contraindicated.",

The internal inguinal ring is an opening in the transversalis fascia for the passage of the spermatic cord; an indirect inguinal hernia, therefore, lies within the fibers of the cremaster muscle. Repair consists of removing the hernia sac and tightening the internal inguinal ring. A femoral hernia passes directly beneath the inguinal ligament at a point medial to the femoral vessels, and a direct inguinal hernia passes through a weakness in the floor of the inguinal canal medial to the inferior epigastric artery. Each is dependent on defects in Hesselbach's triangle of transversalis fascia and neither lies within the cremaster muscle fibers. Repair consists of reconstructing the floor of the inguinal canal. Spigelian hernias, which are rare, protrude through an anatomic defect that can occur along the lateral border of the rectus muscle at its junction with the linea semilunaris. An interparietal hernia is one in which the hernia sac, instead of protruding in the usual fashion, makes its way between the fascial layers of the abdominal wall.

This feature results from preservation and hypertrophy of the segment with direct venous drainage to the I VC in the face of atrophy of the rest of the liver due to venous obstruction.* IVC compression or occlusion from the segment I hypertrophy is also a common feature, as is thrombosis of the portal vein.* Confirmation of the suspected diagnosis is by hepatic venography via a transjugular approach, which demonstrates occlusion of the hepatic veins and may allow a transjugular biopsy.",

Imperforate anus may be broadly classified into \"high\" or \"low, \" depending on whether the rectum ends above or below the level of the levator ani complex. In 90% of females, but only 50% of males, the lesion is of the low variety. The rectal fistula may end in the prostatic urethra or vagina in the high cases, while the low cases terminate in a perineal fistula. For the low cases, only a perineal operation may be required and these children will be expected to be continent. A pull-through procedure will be required for the high imperforate anus and the likelihood of continence is smaller. If there is doubt about the level or location of the termination of the rectum, it is better to perform a temporary colostomy than to compromise the ultimate chances of continence by an injudicious perineal approach.",

        "exp": "Gastric ulcers have been classified as type I (incisura or most inferior portion of lesser curvature), type II (gastric and duodenal), type III (pyloric and prepyloric), and type IV (juxtacortical). Indications for surgery are intractability, perforation, obstruction, and bleeding. A patient with an intractable type I ulcer can be treated with an antrectomy alone or with a proximal gastric vagotomy. If done properly, antrectomy offers slightly lower recurrence rates and a higher incidence of postoperative sequelae as compared with proximal gastric vagotomy. However, significant scarring along the lesser curvature makes a proximal gastric vagotomy technically unfeasible. Gastric outlet obstruction and severe inflammation around the pylorus and duodenum make resection a difficult and dangerous option. Similarly, pyloroplasty is often not adequate in the setting of gastric outlet obstruction to provide adequate drainage. Vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy, although associated with the highest recurrence rate, offers the best choice in the described setting. In an elderly patient with a bleeding duodenal ulcer, recurrence rates are less of a consideration and thus the simplest and most expedient operation offers the best surgical outcome. Vagotomy and pyloroplasty with oversewing of the ulcer is the best choice in this setting. Finally, in a young patient with intractable type III ulcers, antrectomy with vagotomy offers the best long-term outcome. Recurrence rates following this procedure are about 2-3%, as compared with 7. 4% for vagotomy and drainage and 10-31% in patients receiving a proximal gastric vagotomy only.",

The malignant tumors arising in the esophagus are usually squamous cell carcinomas except those involving the esophagogastric junction, which are usually adenocarcinomas. Even though squamous cell carcinomas are weakly radiosensitive, surgical extirpation affords reasonable, if short-term, palliation. Some authorities recommend radiotherapy for palliation alone or in combination with surgery to treat this lesion. Adenocarcinomas are not particularly radiosensitive and surgical treatment is generally employed.

Intrahepatic cystic dilation can coexist (Caroli's disease), but it represents a distinct problem and is managed differently.

Rather, most patients present with other conditions such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. Ultrasonography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is helpful in demonstrating cysts. Nonsurgical treatment of these cysts results in high morbidity and mortality, and therefore surgery is advised in all cases. The present recommendation is for complete resection of the cyst and Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy. Since malignant changes in choledochal cysts have been frequently described, complete resection rather than the performance of an internal drainage procedure is preferred whenever the resection can be done safely.",

Left inferior (posterior) intraperitoneal space OR Left subhepatic space/lesser sac: The most common cause of infection here is complicated acute pancreatitis. In practice, a perforated gastric ulcer rarely causes a collection here because the potential space is obliterated by adhesions. ABDOMINAL ABSCESS# There are four peritoneal and three extraperitoneal spaces in which pus may collect.# Three of these spaces are on either side of the body, and one is approximately in the midline.# Left superior (anterior) intraperitoneal ('left subphrenic') = common came of an abscess here is an operation on the stomach, the tail of the pancreas, the spleen or the splenic flexure of the colon.# Right superior (anterior) intraperitoneal ('right subphrenic') = Common causes here are perforating cholecystitis, a perforated duodenal ulcer, a duodenal cap 'blow out' following gastrectomy and appendicitis.# Right inferior (posterior) intraperitoneal ('right subhepatic') lies in Rutherford Morison's pouch. It is the deepest space of the four and the commonest site of a subphrenic abscess which usually arises from appendicitis, cholecystitis, a perforated duodenal ulcer or following upper abdominal surgery.# Extraperitoneal. There are three of these:- Right and left extraperitoneal which are terms given to perinephric abscesses;- Midline extraperitoneal which is another name for the 'bare' area of the liver which may develop an abscess in amoebic hepatitis (commonest cause) or a pyogenic liver abscess. Educational Points:# The pelvis is the commonest site of an intraperitoneal abscess because the vermiform appendix is often pelvic in position and also the Fallopian tubes are frequent sites of infection. A pelvic abscess can also occur as a sequel to any case of diffuse peritonitis and is a common sequel of anastomotic leakage following large bowel and rectal surgery.# The most characteristic symptoms of a pelvic abscess are diarrhea and the passage of mucus in the stools.# It is no exaggeration to say that the passage of mucus, occurring for the first time in a patient who has, or is recovering from, peritonitis, is pathognomonic of pelvic abscess.# Left to nature, a proportion of these abscesses bursts into the rectum, after which the patient nearly always recovers rapidly. Laparotomy is almost never necessary.# Rectal drainage of a pelvic abscess is far preferable to suprapubic drainage (risks peritoneal infection).# Subdiaphragmatic abscess: remember the aphorism, 'pus somewhere, pus nowhere else, pus under diaphragm. 9# A swinging pyrexia is usually present, unless antibiotics or drugs (steroids) have interfered.# Ultrasound or CT scanning is the investigation of choice and permits early detection of subphrenic collections.# Ga67/Indium-111 white cell scanning may occasionally prove helpful when other imaging techniques have failed.",

A CT scan of her abdomen shows multiple low-density solid masses occupying the entire right lobe of her liver as well as most of the left lobe. What is the best treatment for this patient?",
        "exp": "The CT scan findings of this patient plus the history of prolonged use of oral contraceptives are characteristic in hepatocellular adenoma. Because the tumor extensively involves both the right and left lobes of the liver, oral contraceptive use must be discontinued, and the patient must be observed for 3-6 months. Significant reduction in size of the adenoma has been noted in many cases after cessation of oral contraceptive use. If there is no regression of lesions, then liver transplantation should be recommended.",
