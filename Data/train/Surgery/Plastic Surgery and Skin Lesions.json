Only small graft can be taken For critical and small areas such as an eyelid, a full thickness graft is selected, so that contraction of the grafted material is minimum. Composite graft: Is a graft that contains tissue in addition to the epidermis and dermis. Depending on the donor site, it can contain subcutaneous fat, cailage, and even muscle. It is ideal for repair of deeper defects. Free Flap: - It involves autogenous transplant of vascularised tissues. There is devascularization from donor site & revascularization at recipient bed.",
