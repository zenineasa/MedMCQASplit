ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS* Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of gall bladder and is related to gallstones in 90-95% of cases.* Characteristic triad of cholecystits: RUQ pain + Fever + Leucocytosis* Obstruction of the cystic duct leading to biliary colic is the initial event in acute cholecystitis. Clinical presentation* RUQ pain of much longer duration than biliary colic, is the MC symptom* Other common symptoms: Fever, nausea, and vomiting* Upon Physical examination: RUQ tenderness and guarding are usually present inferior to the right costal margin.* Murphy's sign: Inspiratory arrest with deep palpation in the RUQ in acute cholecystitis.* Boas sign: Hyperesthesia below right scapula in acute cholecystitis",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Iatrogenic trauma o Hemobilia is defined as bleeding into the biliary' tree from an abnormal communication between a blood vessel and bile duct. Causes of hemobilia. Trauma (most common). Iatrogenic trauma is the most common cause. (includes interventional radiological procedures, percutaneous liver biopsy, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, operations on gallbladder and bile duct). Blunt trauma is more common cause than penetrating trauma. Gall stones. Vascular pathologies - aneurysms, angiodysplasias, hemangiomas. Uncommon causes. Malignant tumors of liver, biliary' tree, gall bladder, pancreas. Parasitic infection. Heaptic abscess. Cholangitis. Acalculus cholecystitis. Clinical presentationo Classical triad consists of. Upper abdominal pain (biliary colic). Obstructive jaundice (obstruction by blood clots). Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Hematemesis. Melena. Diagnosiso Diagnosis of hemobilia is typically made on upper endoscopy with findings of bleeding from the ampulla of vater. o Arterial angiography is the investigation of choice as it will reveal the source of bleeding in about 90% of cases, o Management. Minor hemobilia can be managed conservatively. For major hemobilia transarterial embolization (TAE) is first line of therapy. Surgery is indicated when TAE has failed, it consists of:# Ligation of bleeding vessels, excision of aneurysms, or nonselective ligation of a main hepatic artery.",
