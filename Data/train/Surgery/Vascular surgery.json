Raynauds disease Is ds of young women* (F: M ratio is 5: 1) commonly the upper limbs* are affected specially the fingers (the thumb is generally escaped) The disease is characterized by Raynauds phenomenon* which is a series of attacks of Local syncope - digits become cold and white* Local asphyxia - digits turn blue with burning sensation* Local recovery -digits regain normal colour* Pulses remain unaffected* as this is the disease which affects aerioles With the help of points (a) and (b) Raynauds ds can be ruled out. Atherosclerosis (Senile gangrene) Seen in elderly people over 50 years of age. Thus because of age factor we can rule out atherosclerosis. Myocardial infaction Age factor again helps in ruling it out as MI is generally seen in elderly, though its incidence is increasing in young, but it cannot be a more common cause than Buerger's disease. Buerger's (Thromboangitis obliterans) Usual victims of this ds are young men below 40 yrs of age, who are smokers (ds is not seen in females and nonsmokers). Buerger ds is the inflammatory reaction in the aerial wall with involvement of the neighbouring vein and nerve, terminating in thrombosis of the aery. It characterstically involves small and medium sized aeries (plantars, tibial and radial aery) Both upper and lower extremities are affected. In lower extremity the ds. occurs beyond the popliteal aery. In upper extremity the ds occurs beyond the brachial a. Early in the course of Buergers ds the superficial veins are involved producing the characterstic migratory, recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis. An imp difference with atheroselerosis is that, atherosclerosis is a disease of large sized aeries, buergers is a ds of small aeries.",

Methods of prevention are guided by the risk score and include the use of compression stockings, calf pumps and pharmacological agents, such as low molecular weight heparin. The symptoms and signs of DVT include calf pain, swelling, warmth, redness and engorged veins. However, most will show no physical signs. On palpation the muscle may be tender and there may be a positive Homans' sign (calf pain on dorsiflexion of the foot), but this test is neither sensitive nor specific. Duplex Doppler ultrasound and venography can be used to assess flow and the presence of a thrombosis. Other investigations include D-dimer.

In the long term, lymphangiomas thrombose and fibrose, forming hard nodules that may raise concerns about malignancy. If lymphangiomas are <5cm across, they are termed lymphangioma circumscriptum, and if they are more widespread, they are termed lymphangioma diffusum. If they form a reticulate pattern of ridges then it has been termed lymphoedema ab igne. Lymphangiomas frequently weep (lymphorrhoea, chylorrhoea), causing skin maceration, and they act as a poal for infection. Protein-losing diarrhoea, chylous ascites, chylothorax, chyluria and discharge from lymphangiomas suggest lymphangectasia (megalymphatics) and chylous reflux. Ulceration, non-healing bruises and raised purple-red nodules should lead to suspicion of malignancy. Lymphangiosarcoma was originally described in postmastectomy oedema (Stewa-Treves' syndrome) and affects around 0. 5% of patients at a mean onset of 10 years. However, lymphangiosarcoma can develop in any long-standing lymphoedema, but usually takes longer to manifest (20 years). It presents as single or multiple bluish/red skin and subcutaneous nodules that spread to form satellite lesions, which may then become confluent. Thediagnosis is usually made late and confirmed by excision biopsy. Amputation offers the best chance of survival but, even then, most patients live for less than 3 years. It has been suggested that lymphoedema leads to an impairment of immune surveillance and so predisposes to other malignancies, although the causal association is not as definite as it is for lymphangiosarcoma.

Suction draws the vein into tip of the vein resector while a rotating blade effectively removes the leg vein.

Genetic susceptibility Primary lymphoedema can be familial or sporadic. In familial cases the genetic mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, recessive or x-linked pattern. In the last few years the application of Next Generation Sequencing, which allows identification of genetic mutations, even in sporadic cases and smaller families, has increased our understanding of the genetic basis of lymphoedema. So far, mutations in more than 20 genes have been linked to the development of primary lymphoedema. In individuals with familial mutations the penetrance of lymphoedema can often be incomplete leading to a large variability in clinical presentation. Involvement of other systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, digestive) is common and can indicate a specific mutation. Presence of isolated lower limb lymphedema at bih, classically described as Milroy's disease, suggests mutation in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4)/ vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) or VEGF-C. In these patients, reduced initial uptake and presence of touous lymphatic tracts with evidence of rerouting in lymphangiography suggests mutation in the VEGF-C gene. lymphoedema can also be present as a minor sign in some well-recognised syndromes. Primary lymphoedema is present in less than 10% of cases of tuberous sclerosis (TSC1 and 2 gene mutations). Lymphoedema has been repoed in patients with Noonan syndrome in the presence of PTPN11, SOS1 or KRAS mutations, and in patients with Turner syndrome (monosomy X) and capillary malformation-aeriovenous malformation syndrome (RAS p21 protein activator 1 (RASA1) mutation).

The GSV is identified and dissected to the SFJ, which should be clearly established before the vein is divided to avoid disastrous inadveent transection of the superficial femoral vein. The anatomy is often variable but six GSV tributaries may be encountered close to the SFJ: Laterally: * superficial inferior epigastric vein; * superficial circumflex iliac vein; Medially: * superficial external pudendal vein; * deep external pudendal vein; Distally: * anterior accessory saphenous vein; * posteriomedial thigh vein. Classically, these are ligated distal to their divisions. A flush SFJ ligation is then performed and the GSV retrogradely stripped to around the knee. Phlebectomy is performed as discussed above. Closure of the cribriform fascia, with sutures or synthetic patches over the ligated SFJ, does not reduce groin recurrence. Stripping to the lowest point of reflux may improve results, but at a cost of increased saphenous nerve complications and is not widely performed. More recently, some surgeons argue that surgical trauma and subsequent inflammation in the groin is associated with neovascularisation, which in turn may lead to recurrence. Fuhermore, others hypothesise that it is the loss of the normal groin tributaries that may be responsible for driving the process of neovascularisation. These concepts have led some to believe that ligation of the refluxing vein should be distal to the tributaries and that the junction itself should be left untouched. There is no clear clinical evidence to suppo these hypotheses. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 981",

Diminution of a femoral and/or popliteal pulse can often be appreciated by comparing it with its opposite number; however, pedal pulses are either clinically palpable or absent. Popliteal pulses are often difficult to feel; a popliteal aery aneurysm should be suspected if the popliteal pulse is prominent with concomitant loss of the natural concavity of the popliteal fossa. Pulsation distal to an aerial occlusion is usually absent although the presence of a highly developed collateral circulation may allow distal pulses to be palpable - this is most likely to occur with an iliac stenosis. In this case, exercise (walking until claudication develops) usually causes the pulse to disappear as vasodilation occurs below the obstruction, causing the pulse pressure to reduce. An aerial bruit, heard on auscultation over the pulse, indicates turbulent flow and suggests a stenosis. It is an unreliable clinical sign as tight stenoses often do not have bruits. A continuous 'machinery' murmur over an aery usually indicates an aeriovenous fistula.
