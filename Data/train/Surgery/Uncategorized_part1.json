        "exp": "Urine microscopy for malignant cytology \"Painless haematuria is by far the most common symptom of bladder cancer and should be regarded as indicative of a bladder carcinoma until proven otherwise. \" Bailey & Love 25/e p1336 (24/e p1363) Cigarette smoking is the main etiological factor and accounts, for about 50% of bladder cancers Among the given options 'urine microscopy' is the best choice for investigating a pt. with high suspicion for bladder ca. This is not a good screening test but a positive result is highly specific. The best investigation would be cystoscopy & biopsy. Investigations for bladder cancer 1. Urinary cytology - Exfoliated cells from both normal and neoplastic urothelium can be readily identified in voided urine. Examination of cytological specimens can detect the malignant cells either at the time of initial presentation or during follow-up. Cytological examination may be especially useful in screening high-risk population and assessing the response to treatment. 2. Cystourethroscopy and tumor resection - The diagnosis and initial staging of bladder cancer is made by cystoscopy and transurethral resection. 3. Imaging (IVP, CT, MRI) - Although various imaging techniques can detect bladder cancer, its presence is confirmed by cystoscopy & biopsy. - Therefore imaging modalities are used to image the upper urinary tract and, when infiltrating bladder tumors are detected to assess the depth of muscle wall infiltration and the presence of local & distant metastasis. - Intravenous urography remains one of the most common imaging tests for the evaluation of hematuria. However, intravenous pyelography is increasingly being replaced by computed tomography (CT) urography, which is more accurate, for evaluation of the entire abdominal cavity, renal parenchyma, and ureters in patients with hematuria. Bladder tumors may be recognized as pedunculated, radiolucent filling defects projecting into the lumen; nonpapillary, infiltrating tumors may result in fixation or flattening of the bladder wall. 4. Urinary tumor markers - - Several new tests have been developed in order to overcome the shocomings of urinary cytology such as the low sensitivity for low-grade superficial tumors and inter-observer variability. - Commercially available tests include, the BTA test, the BTA stat test, the BTA TRAK assay determination of urinary nuclear matrix protein (NMP22), Immunocyt and Uro. Vysion. - These tests can detect cancer specific proteins in urine (BTA/NMP22) or augment cytology by identifying cell surface or cytogenetic markers in the nucleus. Other tests under investigation include identification of the Lewis X antigen on exfoliated urothelial cells, and the determination of telomerase activity in exfoliated cells. - These tests have been demonstrated to enhance detection of bladder cancer when used either individually or in combination with cytology. They have been used to detect both new index tumors as well as recurrent tumors.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Ankylosing Spondylitis The basic pathologic lesion of ankylosing spondylitis occurs at the entheses, which are sites of attachment to bone of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules. Enthesopathy results from inflammation, with subsequent calcification and ossification at and around the entheses. Inflammation with cellular infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is associated with erosion and eburnation of the subligamentous bone. The process usually stas at the sacroiliac joints. Other enthesopathic sites include the iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, patella, and calcaneum. Ankylosing spondylitis/ AS/ Bechterew's disease/ Bechterew syndrome/ Marie Strumpell disease/Spondyloahritis is a chronic, painful, degenerative inflammatory ahritis primarily affecting spine and sacroiliac joints, causing eventual fusion of the spine. AS is a systemic rheumatic disease and one of the seronegative spondyloahropathies. About 90% of the patients express the HLA-B27 genotype. Men are affected more than women by a ratio in excess of 10: 1. Typical signs of progressed AS are the visible formation of syndesmophytes on X-rays and abnormal bone outgrowths similar to osteophytes affecting the spine. Complete fusion results in a complete rigidity of the spine, a condition known as bamboo spine. In 40% of cases, ankylosing spondylitis is associated with iridocyclitis causing eye pain and photophobia. 4. 1 AS is also associated with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and Reiter's disease Other complications are aoic regurgitation, Achilles tendinitis, AV node block and amyloidosis & restrictive lung disease. A clinical examination and X-ray studies of the spine, which show characteristic spinal changes and sacroiliitis, are the major diagnostic tools. The Schober's test is a useful clinical measure of flexion of the lumbar spine performed during examination.",

It is the result of damage to auriculotemporal nerve and aberrant innervation of sweat glands by parasympathetic secretomotor fibres which were destined for the parotid. Now instead of causing salivary secretion from the parotid, they cause secretion from the sweat glands. The condition can be treated by tympanic neurectomy which intercepts these parasympathetic fibres at the level of middle ear. Some people like to place a sheet of fascia lata between the skin and the underlying fat to prevent secretomotor fibres reaching the sweat glands. Generally, no treatment other than reassurance is required in most of these patients. Also known as Crocodile tears (gustatory lacrimation): There is unilateral lacrimation with mastication. This is due to faulty regeneration of parasympathetic fibres which now supply lacrimal gland instead of the salivary glands. It can be treated by section of greater superficial petrosal nerve or tympanic neurectomy.",

There are several different types of DCIS. For example, ductal comedocarcinoma refers to DCIS with necrosis (areas of dead or degenerating cancer cells). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC): IDC is also known as invasive ductal carcinoma. IDC begins in the milk ducts of the breast and penetrates the wall of the duct, invading the fatty tissue of the breast and possibly other regions of the body. IDC is the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for 80% of breast cancer diagnoses.",

Atherosclerosis (Senile gangrene) Seen in elderly people over 50 years of age. Thus because of age factor we can rule out atherosclerosis. Myocardial infaction Age factor again helps in ruling it out as MI is generally seen in elderly, though its incidence is increasing in young, but it cannot be a more common cause than Buerger's disease. Buerger's (Thromboangitis obliterans) Usual victims of this ds are young men below 40 yrs of age, who are smokers (ds is not seen in females and nonsmokers). Buerger ds is the inflammatory reaction in the arterial wall with involvement of the neighbouring vein and nerve, terminating in thrombosis of the artery. It characterstically involves small and medium sized arteries (plantars, tibial and radial artery) Both upper and lower extremities are affected. In lower extremity the ds. occurs beyond the popliteal artery. In upper extremity the ds occurs beyond the brachial art. Early in the course of Buergers ds the superficial veins are involved producing the characterstic migratory, recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis.

D: Instrumentation Instrumentation is by far the most common cause of perforation Boerhaave syndrome/Esophageal perforation, is rupture of the esophageal wall caused by excessive vomiting in eating disorders such as bulimia although it may rarely occur in extremely forceful coughing or other situations, such as obstruction by food. It can cause pneumomediastinum and/or mediastinitis (air or inflammation of the mediastinum) and sepsis. Boerhaave syndrome is a transmural perforation of the esophagus, distinct from Mallory-Weiss syndrome, a nontransmural esophageal tear also associated with vomiting. The term is useful for distinguishing it from iatrogenic perforation, which accounts for 85-90% of cases of esophageal rupture, typically as a complication of an endoscopic procedure, feeding tube, or unrelated surgery. It is associated with \"Mackler's triad\" which consists of vomiting, lower thoracic pain and subcutaneous emphysema which the later can be heard as Haman's crunch on physical examination. The most common anatomical location of the tear in Boerhaave syndrome is at left posterolateral wall of the lower third of the esophagus, 2-3 cm before the stomach.",

The tarsal tunnel is bounded superficially by the flexor retinaculum (laciniate ligament). The tibial nerve may be constricted by pressure from without or within this tunnel. Sources of constriction beneath and adjacent to the tarsal tunnel include bone fragments from displaced distal tibial, talar, or calcaneal fractures; tenosynovitis or ganglia of an adjacent tendon sheath; and bone and soft-tissue encroachment in rheumatoid ahritis or ankylosing spondylitis, varicosities, neural tumor (neurilemoma) or perineural fibrosis. Compression of the nerve leads to pain and sensory disturbances over the plantar surface of the foot. The pain may be precipitated by prolonged weight bearing. It is often worse at night and the patient may seek relief by walking around or stamping his or her foot. Paraesthesia and numbness can also be seen. Tinel's percussion test over the posterior tibial nerve may be positive. imaging Studies and Special Tests: Electromyography and nerve conduction studies should be performed but can be normal early in the entrapment. MRI provides excellent visualization of the tarsal tunnel and is indicated if there is suspicion of a space-occupying lesion within the tunnel.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Truncal vagotomy with gastrojejunostomy. Gastric outlet obstruction is manifested by obstruction at the level of the pylorus, which is the outlet of the stomach. Patients may develop vomiting, which may be projectile but non-bilious in nature, nausea or abdominal pain. An unusual finding that may lead to the diagnosis is the succussion splash, a splash-like sound heard over the stomach in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen on shaking the patient, with or without the stethoscope. The diagnosis is typically made by X-ray, which will show an absent air bubble in the stomach, or by CT scan. Causes of gastric outlet obstruction include peptic ulcer disease; tumours of the stomach, including adenocarcinoma (and its linitis plastica variant), lymphoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumours; infections, such as tuberculosis; and infiltrative diseases, such as amyloidosis. Metabolic alkalosis may develop as a result of loss of acid. Traditionally severe cases of Gastric outlet obstruction are treated usually by a gastroenterostomy rather than a pyloroplasty. Truncal vagotomy leads to reduction of the maximal acid output by 50% as vagus nerves are sectioned which critically controls the secretion of gastric acid.",

Intestinal pseudo-obstruction it's the most likely diagnosis, as air-fluid levels are not seen in it. Harrison writes - \"The symptom of chronic pseudo-obstruction are chronic or intermittent constipation, crampy abdominal pain, anorexia and bloating. Abdominal x-rays reveal gaseous distention of the large and small bowel and occasionally of the stomach. Air-fluid levels are unusual and should raise the possibility of mechanical obstruction. \" Acute pseudoobstruction involves only the colon and presents with features of colonic obstruction (as described before). Air-fluid level is also not a feature of colonic obstruction. About the fluid levels remember the following points up to 3 to 5 fluid levels less than 2. 5 cm in length may be normal. multiple air-fluid levels are a feature of mechanical small intestinal obstruction and paralytic liens.

'The longer (the stump) the better', is the general rule for amputation at all sites, but below knee amputation is an exception. The amputation level is kept proximal to the lower third of tibia, since the preponderance of tendinous structures in the lower third predispose to poor circulation and an unstable painful lump. The best level below the knee as, for, as prosthetic fitting is concerned is at the distal musculotendinous junction of the gastrocnemius muscle. Some other imp. points about BK amputation The fibula is transected slightly above the tibial level. No essential differences in healing rate is noted in pts. with or without popliteal pulses, but the absence of a femoral pulse is associated with a high failure rate for BK amputation.

        "exp": "The patient most likely has a pancreatic pseudocyst, which is a complication of pancreatitis. Pancreatic pseudocyst is not a true cyst; it is lined by granulation tissue and collagen. It contains pancreatic juices and lysed blood, so rupture would spill the active digestive enzymes onto the adjacent viscera, paicularly the stomach, small intestine, and transverse colon. Digestive action produces potentially severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Anaphylactic shock results from massive activation of the IgE-mediated branch of the immune system. Pancreatic secretions do not elicit an IgE response. The classic abdominal cyst that ruptures, producing anaphylactic shock, is a hydatid cyst. Carcinomatosis is widespread serosal spread of a carcinoma, typically due to tumor spillage into a body cavity. Although this may occur with pancreatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, this disease is far less likely to occur than is pancreatic pseudocyst in a patient with chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic pseudocyst is not an infective disease. Although septic abscesses do occur in the abdomen, and may even complicate a pancreatic pseudocyst, the danger of rupture is more associated with tissue destruction by pancreatic enzymes than with infection.

        "exp": "B cell Nearly 1 to 20% of people who receive a solid organ transplant develop a lymphoma. - Lymphomas have also been repoed (though less. frequently) after bone-marrow transplants. for other disorders. Why does it happen? - Post-transplant lymphomas are almost always related to infection by the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). - Infection by the Epstein Barr Virus causes a transformation of B-cells which becomes cancerous. In normal individuals other cells of the immune system can tackle the EBV infection, but for organ transplants high doses of drugs that suppress the immune system must be administered. With nothing to control the infection, the chances of developing lymphomas increase. The two main factors that determine the chances of getting lymphoma are: How much immunosuppressive treatment is required - The more the immunosuppression, the more the chances of EBV infection. The status of EBV serology of the recipient of the transplant - If this individual has previously been infected by EBV the chances are that the body remembers the infection and the blood already has called antibodies that can identify and kill the virus. Clinical features Post-transplant lymphomas are usually different. from the usual Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. While most patients have involvement mainly of lymph nodes, other organs are very commonly affected as well. These include the brain, lungs and the intestines. The transplanted organ can also get involved. Treatment Whenever possible, immunosuppressive treatment has to be reduced or stopped. In those who have small and localized disease, surgery or radiation may be attempted. If not, the first line of treatment is usually Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets lymphoma cells. Only when this. fails is chemotherapy attempted. Chemotherapy is deferred until necessary as in paially immunosuppressed individuals, chemotherapy may fuher increase the risk of infections. In those who develop lymphomas after bone marrow transplants, donor leukocyte transfusions can be highly effective. Prognosis of Post transplant lymphomas In general, non-Hodgkin lymphomas occurring after organ transplants have a poorer outcome than other NHLs. Around 60-80% of the victims ultimately succumb to their lymphoma. Involvement of brain has poor prognosis",

Indications of Surgical intervention: (Ref: Bailey and Love 25/e 1145; CSDT 13/e p583; Harrison 17/e p) i) Age of cyst more than 12 weeks without resolution ii) Size of cyst greater than 6 cm. iii) Symptomatic iv) Development of complications (eg. haemorrhage, perforation, g. i. obstruction) But note that these indications for intervention are just a generalization used for teaching the undergraduates. These are not specific indications for interventions. Therapeutic interventions are advised (irrespective of size and duration) when - the pseudocyst is symptomatic or - increasing is size on follow up studies, or - any complication (rupture, hemorrhage, or abscess) arise or - there is suspicion of malignancy. Thus expectant management is adequate (irrespective of size) if the patient is asymptomatic and serial u/s studies show that the cyst is resolving. Surgical methods a) Internal Drainage - most preferred surgical management in uncomplicated pseudocyst is internal drainage. The three options are Cystojejunostomy Cystogastrostomy Cystoduodenostomy Internal drainage can be done either open surgical or laparascopic or by percutaneous catheter-based methods (transgastric puncture and stent placement to create a cystogastrostomy) b) Excision of Pseudocyst - is hardly done and is usually limited to pseudocyst involving the tail of the pancreas. c) External drainage - is done in:? - infected pseudocyst - for immature pseudocyst with thin nonfibrous walls that does not allow safe internal drainage. - in an unstable pt. in whom more complex surgical intervention is precluded. d) Transpapillary pancreatic duct stent: Because pseudocysts often communicate with the pancreatic ductal system, two newer approaches to pseudocyst management are based on main duct drainage, rather than pseudocyst drainage per se. A stent is passed into the pseudocyst through the papilla of Vater. this drainage, paicularly when incomplete, can allow bacteria to enter the pseudocyst and lead to development of an infected pseudocyst. Another transpapillary approach involves placing a stent across the duct defect rather than into the cyst through the defect. By excluding pancreatic juice from the pseudocyst, this bridging intraductal stent may permit the duct disruption to heal and the pseudocyst to resolve without drainage (analogous to the use of common bile duct stents in the setting of a cystic duct leak).",

Tc labelled cells. Two types of radionucleide imaging procedure are used in liver Hepatocyte based imaging (IDA Imaging) - IDA compound are taken up by functioning hepatocytes, excreted unchanged in the bile and are not reabsorbed from the gut This propey of IDA compounds is used in imaging of liver and biliary tract. It will allow the imaging of functioning liver parenchyma and trace the flow of the bile, in the ducts, gall bladder and bowel - Its clinicals use are i) Assessment of regional liver function ii) Demonstration of bile leaks in liver trauma iii) Investigation of biliary obstruction iv) Choledochal cyst v) Demonstration of gall bladder function including cystic duct obstruction as a marker of acute cholecystitis. - Remember the question asked about the use of HIDA scan in acute cholecystitis.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Radioiodine Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is a well-differentiated tumor. In fact, FTC resembles the normal microscopic pattern of the thyroid. FTC originates in follicular cells and is the second most common cancer of the thyroid, after papillary carcinoma. Follicular and papillary thyroid cancers are considered to be differentiated thyroid cancers; together they make up 95% of thyroid cancer cases. Papillary/follicular carcinoma must be considered a variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (mixed form), and Huhle cell carcinoma should be considered a variant of FTC. Despite its well-differentiated characteristics, follicular carcinoma may be ovely or minimally invasive. In fact, FTC tumors may spread easily to other organs. The prognosis is better for younger patients than for patients who are older than 45 years. Patients with FTC are more likely to develop lung and bone metastases than are patients with papillary thyroid cancer. The bone metastases in FTC are osteolytic. Older patients have an increased risk of developing bone and lung metastases. The initial treatment for cancer of the thyroid is surgical. The exact nature of the surgical procedure to be performed depends for the most pa on the extent of the local disease. A total thyroidectomy is performed if the primary tumor is larger than 1 cm in diameter or if there is extrathyroidal involvement or distant metastases. Clinically evident lymphadenopathy should be removed with a neck dissection. If the primary tumor is less than 1 cm in diameter, a unilateral lobectomy might be considered. About 4-6 weeks after surgical thyroid removal, patients must have radioiodine to detect and destroy any metastasis and any residual tissue in the thyroid.",

Fuher treatment decisions are made after tumor staging on histology. Such decisions are based on tumor stage (TNM), grade, size, multiplicity, and recurrence pattern. First see the staging (TNM) The primary bladder cancer is staged according to the depth of invasion into the bladder wall or beyond The urothelial basement membrane separates superficial bladder cancers into Ta (noninvasive) and T1 (invasive) tumors. The muscularis propria separates superficial disease from deeply (muscularis propria) invasive disease. Stage T2 and higher T stage tumors invade the muscularis propria, the true muscle of the bladder wall. If the tumor extends through the muscle to involve the full thickness of the bladder and into the serosa, it is classified as T3.

Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives are liquid monomers that undergo an exothermic reaction on exposure to moisture (eg, on the skin surface), changing to polymers that form a strong tissue bond. When applied to a laceration, the polymer binds the wound edges together to allow normal healing of the underlying tissue. Compared with wounds closed with sutures, the tensile strength of wounds closed by tissue adhesives is less at the time of initial application, but equalizes by one week post-repair. Advantages: Less painful application, and sometimes no need for local anesthetic injection More rapid application and repair time Cosmetically similar results at 12 months post-repair Waterproof barrier Antimicrobial properties Better acceptance by patients No need for suture removal or follow-up Indications and contraindications: For use of tissue adhesives the wound needs to be clean, dry with near perfect hemostasis and under no tension. Complex stellate lesions or crush injuries should not be closed with tissue adhesives since good wound approximation is difficult to achieve. Tissue adhesives are not recommended for lacerations of the hands, feet, or joints, since repetitive movements could cause the adhesive bond to break before sufficient tensile strength is achieved. Tissue adhesives are not recommended for the oral mucosa or other mucosal surfaces or areas of high moisture such as the axillae and perineum.

Post-CPR rib fractures are often bilateral. The site of rib fracture is dependent on: the position of the hands; force used; and method of chest compression (manual or device-assisted). The vast majority (90%+) offractures occur in ribs 2 to 7; fractures in the bony pas of rib numbers 1 and 8 to 10 are possible but probably very rare; it is difficult to see how fractures can occur in rib numbers 11 and 12 following standard manual CPR. The vast majority of fractures (90%+) occur in the anterior third of the bony pa of the rib, some occur in the middle third but - following standard manual CPR - none in the posterior third of the bony pa of the rib. Posterior rib fractures occur following automated band-type CPR. Lateral fractures i. e. those occurring between the anterior and posterior axillary lines, do occur after standard CPR. If a fracture is noted in rib numbers 10 to 12 or in the posterior third of the bony pa of a rib, then non-resuscitation trauma should be suspected. Chest x-ray is unreliable as a diagnostic tool for detecting rib fractures. CT is better than x-ray and may complement the post-moem detection of rib fractures. Fractures are more common On the left side of the chest With increasing age of the patient In females With increasing length of time of resuscitation attempts Following the involvement of untrained persons With the use of ACD-CPR",

(Described ahead in detail). Theoretically all the options can cause 'Tree-in-bud' sign (although Klebsiella has not been mentioned in the list). So the next clue is Bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow transplant causes a transient state of immunological deficiency leading to a wide variety of oppounistic infections.

(Not seen on X-rays) Peripheral, small, centrilobular nodules are connected to linear, branching opacities that have more than one contiguous branching site, thus resembling a budding or, fruiting tree: this is known as tree-in-bud-pattern. It represents dilated and impacted (mucus or pus-filled) centrilobular bronchioles. The presence of tree-in-bud is indicative of small airway disease. It is most commonly associated with endobronchial spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. But it can also be seen in a large number of conditions. Pulmonary infectious disorders involving the small airways are the most common causes of the tree-in-bud sign. Any infectious organism, including bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal agents, can involve the small airways and cause a tree-in-bud pattern.

Six types of synol joints are: Hinge Ball-and-socket Pivot Condyloid (angular or ellipsoidal) Plane (gliding) Saddle. - The elbow is an example of a hinge joint. Here, the convex and concave aiculating bones allow movement along one plane, similar to a door. -The shoulder and hip are the only ball-and-socket joints in the body. In this type of joint, one bone has a spherical head that aiculates with a corresponding concavity. This joint frees the joint to move in many directions. - In a pivot joint, one round-shaped aiculating bone fits within a corresponding depression on another bone. This joint allows one bone to rotate against the other. An example is the radioulnar joint (joint of the radius and ulna) in the forearm. - In a condyloid (angular) joint, one bone has an oval aiculating head that rests within an oval concavity. This joint permits angular movement of the bones. The metacarpophalangeal joint (junction between the metacarpals and phalanges) of the hand are examples of condyloid joints - Plane joints have two flat bones joined. The sole movement of the bones is sho gliding motions. An example of this joint is the intearsal joint (junction between the tarsal bones) of the feet. Saddle joint bones have convex and concave surfaces similar to a saddle. This joint allows the joint to move in many directions. The carpometacarpal joint of the thumb is an example saddle joint. II. As their name implies, amphiahrosis joints (slightly movable joints) have limited movement. The two types of amphiahrosis joints are: Syndesmosis (fibrous) Symphysis (cailaginous). - A Syndesmosis joint occurs when two bones join by a section of cailage. The junction between the tibia and fibula is an example. A symphysis joint forms when two bones fuse by a fibrocailage pad. Typical symphysis joints are between the pubic symphysis (pubic bones in the pelvis), and in the veebral column between individual veebrae. Interveebral discs act as weight-bearing shock absorbers for walking, jumping, and lifting. III. An immovable joint is called a synahrosis. The two types of this joint are: Sutures Gomphoses. - Sutures are joined by sho fibers of dense fibrous connective tissue and are in the skull. - The single example of a gomphosis joint is the teeth sitting within their sockets. IV. An example of a bony fusion joint is the fusion of the three bones forming a coxa (hip bone): the ilium, ischium, and pubis.",

Nerve degeneration The pa of the neurone distal to the point of injury undergoes secondary or Wallerian degeneration; the proximal pa undergoes primary or retrograde degeneration upto a single node. Nerve regeneration As regeneration begins, the axonal stump from the proximal segment begins to grow distally. If the endoneural tube with its contained Schwann cells is intact, the axonal sprout may readily pass along its primary course and reinnervate the end-organ. The rate of recovery of axon is 1 mm per day. The muscles nearest to the site of injury recovers first, followed by others as the nerve reinnervates muscles from proximal to distal, the so-called motor march.

Total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with MTC because of the high incidence of multicentricity, the more aggressive course, and the fact that 131I therapy usually is not effective. Central compartment nodes frequently are involved early in the disease process, so that a bilateral central neck node dissection should be routinely performed. In patients with palpable cervical nodes or involved central neck nodes, ipsilateral or bilateral, modified radical neck dissection is recommended. The role of prophylactic lateral neck dissection is controversial. However, in patients with tumors >1 cm, ipsilateral prophylactic modified radical neck dissection is recommended because >60% of these patients have nodal metastases. If ipsilateral nodes are positive, a contralateral node dissection should be performed. In the case of locally recurrent or metastatic disease, tumor debulking is advised not only to ameliorate symptoms of flushing and diarrhea, but also to decrease risk of death from recurrent central neck or mediastinal disease. External beam radiotherapy is controversial, but is recommended for patients with unresectable residual or recurrent tumor. There is no effective chemotherapy regimen. Radiofrequency ablation done laparoscopically appears promising in the palliative treatment of liver metastases >1. 5 cm. In patients who have hypercalcemia at the time of thyroidectomy, only obviously enlarged parathyroid glands should be removed. The other parathyroid glands should be preserved and marked in patients with normocalcemia, as only about 20% of patients with MEN2A develop HPT. When a normal parathyroid cannot be maintained on a vascular pedicle, it should be removed, biopsied to confirm that it is a parathyroid, and then autotransplanted to the forearm of the nondominant arm. Total thyroidectomy is indicated in RET mutation carriers once the mutation is confirmed. The procedure should be performed before age of 5 years in MEN2A patients and before age 1 year old in MEN2B patients. Central neck dissection can be avoided in children who are RET -positive and calcitonin-negative with a normal ultrasound examination. When the calcitonin is increased or the ultrasound suggests a thyroid cancer, a prophylactic central neck dissection is indicated.",

Type I: Complete separation of epiphysis from the metaphysis without fracture. Common in rickets, scurvy and osteomyelitis. Type II: The fracture involves the physis and a triangle of metaphyseal bone (Thurston Holland sign). This is the commonest type of epiphyseal injury accounting for 73 percent of cases over 10 years of age. Type III: The fracture is intra- aicular and extends along the physis and then along the growth plate. This injury is relatively uncommon. Type IV: The fracture is intra- aicular and extends through the epiphysis, physis and metaphysis. Perfect reduction is necessary and open reduction is more often necessary to prevent growth arrest.

On examination, the man's blood pressure is 165/95 mm Hg. Plasma norepinephrine is 450 pg/mL (normal, 150-400 pg/mL), plasma epinephrine is 115 pg/mL (normal, 25-100 pg/mL), and 24-hour urinary VMA is 11 mg (normal, < 8 mg). Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's hypertension?",
        "exp": "A pheochromocytoma is a tumor arising from chromaffin cells that secretes excess catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, or both). It is one endocrine cause of hypertension, due to peripheral vasoconstriction and/or increased cardiac output. While most patients have higher than normal baseline plasma levels of catecholamines, it is not uncommon for paroxysmal symptomatic episodes to be superimposed upon the basal problem. These \"attacks\" may occur several times a week (or more often) and last for up to 15 minutes. During an attack, respiration can increase, the patient may become aware of a forceful pounding of the heart that progresses to include a throbbing headache, and peripheral vasoconstriction can raise body temperature and lead to reflex sweating. Marked anxiety may also accompany the episode. Diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring increased plasma or urinary catecholamines or their metabolites. 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is a congenital disorder than can cause hypertension due to excessive production of the weak mineralocoicoid, deoxycoicosterone, by the inner two zones of the adrenal coex. This results in excessive renal retention of sodium and water and subsequent hypertension. While the hypertension is usually present from bih, a late-onset variant of this disorder has been described in which the symptoms do not present until late childhood or adolescence. Virilization is also present due to excessive secretion of adrenal androgens. Conn's syndrome is another endocrine cause of hypertension. In this case, the increase in blood pressure is due to excessive renal retention of sodium and water resulting from the increased plasma concentration of aldosterone. The paroxysmal symptoms and increased catecholamines present in this patient are not present with primary hyperaldosteronism. Renin-secreting tumors are rare and can be confused with primary hyperaldosteronism. The excessive secretion of renin by the tumor can increase the formation of angiotensin II with subsequent hyperaldosteronism. Sodium and water retention, together with hypokalemia, are present. Increased plasma renin and plasma aldosterone are suggestive of a renin-secreting tumor, whereas primary hyperaldosteronism would present as increased plasma aldosterone, but decreased plasma renin.

Sympathetic innervation of the cutaneous structures of the breast is provided by the medial and lateral branches of the ventral ramus of 3rd to 6th intercostal nerves. While both nociceptive pain (due to damage of muscles and ligaments) and neuropathic pain can occur after surgery for breast cancer, neuropathic pain is more likely to persist after wound healing has occurred. Four pain syndromes have been distinguished 1. Phantom breast pain is a painful (often knife-like or shooting) sensation that the removed breast is still present. 2. Intercostobrachial neuralgia: usually known as post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMP). Consists of pain in the axilla, medial upper arm and anterior chest wall and is often caused by nerve damage during axillary node dissection 3. Neuroma pain: can occur from scars from either mastectomy or lumpectomy but is more common if surgery is followed by radiotherapy. 4. Other nerve injury pain: can occur even if the intercostobrachial nerve is spared and is more common in breast reconstruction and implants. In Jung et also review, there were 21 studies with follow-up periods from 1-96 months (one study of 210 months), which revealed the following widely varying ranges of prevalence estimates: Phantom breast pain 3-44 per cent Intercostobrachial neuralgia (ICN) 16-39 per cent for all breast cancer surgery; ICN in breast-conserving surgery 14-61 per cent Neuroma pain 23-49 per cent.",

Perforation may result from the resectoscope going through the bladder wall or from overdistention of the bladder with irrigation fluid. Most bladder perforations are extraperitoneal and are signaled by poor return of the irrigating fluid. Awake patients will typically complain of nausea, diaphoresis, and retropubic or lower abdominal pain. Large extraperitoneal and most intraperitoneal perforations are presenting as sudden unexplained hypotension or hypertension, and with generalized abdominal pain in awake patients. Regardless of the anesthetic technique employed, perforation should be suspected in settings of sudden hypotension or hypertension, paicularly with acute, vagally mediated bradycardia.

Hereditary angioneurotic edema is caused due to deficiency of plasma protein Ci esterase inhibitor. It is an autosomal dominant disorder. It is clinically characterized by:- Episodic edema (nonpitting) in the skin and extremities as well as in the laryngeal and intestinal mucosa provoked by emotional stress or trauma or extreme changes in temperature. Pathophysiology The mediators of edema formation in these patients are proteolytic fragments of complement C2, kinin and bradykinin. - Normally these mediators are kept in check by C1 inhibitor (CIINH) Hereditary angioneurotic edema is caused due to deficiency of the enzyme C1 inhibitor (CIINH). - (CIINH) blocks the first step in the complement pathway i. e. activation of C1. C1 complement is activated by its binding to immune complex. - CIINH prevents this activation. Thus, in the absence of CIINH there is excess of activated C1 which leads to increase in the level of activated C2. - Activated C2 mediates edema formation. Besides being inhibitor of CI, CIINH is also an inhibitor of kinin ReneratinR system. -Kining generating system includes, Hageman. factor and prekallikrein. - Activated hageman factor and prekallikrein leads to the generation of bradykinin which mediates edema formation. Normally the activation of kinin generating system is prevented by (CIINH). - In the absence of (CIINH) there is increased activation of kallikrein and. factor XII which in turn leads to increased. formation of bradykinin which produces edema. Another impoant point about hereditary angioneurotic edema is:? - It presents with angioedema without uicaria. - All patients with angioedema without uicaria should be screened with C4 level which is reduced during and between the attacks of Hereditary angioneurotic edema. One more impoant point Angioneurotic edema can also be precipitated by angiotensin conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, - It occurs due to increased level of bradykinin in the serum. - Bradykinin is degraded by an angiotensin conveing enzyme present in the lung. - ACE inhibitors blocks this enzyme leading to decreased degradation of Bradykinin.",

Pathophysiology: The pathogenesis of mammary PD and the origin of Paget cells were once controversial. It is now widely accepted as an underlying intraductal carcinoma of the breast with retrograde extension into the overlying epidermis through mammary duct epithelium. Malignant epithelial (Paget) cells infiltrate and proliferate in the epidermis, causing thickening of the nipple and the areolar skin. Paget cells often express cell markers that mimic those of the underlying breast carcinoma, including glandular epithelial cell markers (ie, low-molecular-weight cytokeratins, or CAM 5. 2). They also express tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); Ca 15-3 (milk fat globule protein); some oncogenes (TP53, c-erb B-2); and other cell markers, such as epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP-15) that are found in tumor cells of ductal carcinoma of the breast.",

It is an acquired disease Although earlier it was thought to be a congenital disease, it is now considered to be an acquired infection of natal cleft hair follicles. The hair follicles become infected and rupture into the subcutaneous tissues to form a pilonidal abscess. Hair from surrounding skin is pulled into the abscess cavity by the friction generated by the gluteal muscles during walking. More common in males The incidence of pilonidal disease is more common in males (3: 1 male: female ratio) between ages 15 & 40 with peak incidence between 16 & 20 yrs. Pilonidal ds is more common in people with more body hair (hirsute). The ds. is almost rare in persons with less body hair.

A hernia is said to be strangulated when the blood supply of its content is seriously impaired. Most constricted pa of the hernia is its neck. Therefore strangulation develops in hernias in which neck is constricted. Femoral hernias have the highest rate of all strangulated hernias (5-20%) because the neck of the femoral hernia is very narrow. Indirect inguinal hernias do not strangulate as often as femoral hernias but strangulate more than direct hernia. In umbilical hernia strangulation varies with age?- In infants the hernias closes spontaneously so there is no chance of strangulation.- In adult strangulation is a frequent complication.",

Thus, there is physiological conduction block without anatomic disruption. The injury is temporary and recovery is complete. It is seen in crutchpalsy, tourniquet palsy, and saturday night palsy. 2.

Although there usually is a history of resisting vomiting, in a small number of patients, the injury occurs silently, without any antecedent history. When the chest radiogram of a patient with an esophageal perforation shows air or an effusion in the pleural space, the condition is often misdiagnosed as a pneumothorax or pancreatitis. An elevated serum amylase caused by the extrusion of saliva through the perforation may fix the diagnosis of pancreatitis in the mind of an unwary physician. If the chest radiogram is normal, a mistaken diagnosis of myocardial infarction or dissecting aneurysm is often made.

Although fever and elevated peripheral white blood cell count with a left shift are usual indicators of infection, their positive predictive value for diagnosis of infectious complications in burn victims is very low because they are commonly seen in uninfected burned children whose wounds are uncovered. Neither severity of fever (frequently > 39\u00b0C) nor response to antipyretic therapy is a reliable indicator of infection. Peak fever in burned children without infection usually occurs on the second day after the burn, with a second peak around the sixth and seventh days. Fever is probably the result of an increase in metabolic rate and an alteration of hypothalamic temperature regulation. Fever usually subsides without specific therapy, coincident with re-epithelialization of the burn wound or successful grafting of all open areas. Thus, fever alone in the burned child is not a reliable indicator of infection or of the need to investigate for infection or prescribe antibiotic therapy. \"",

For distal esophageal cancers, many thoracic surgeons would use the classic Ivor-Lewis operation, which consists of mobilizing the stomach in the abdomen and then performing a right thoracotomy with mediastinal clean out, esophagectomy, and esophagogastrostomy. In some circumstances, and by some surgeons' preference, a left thoracotomy approach might be used.

It is associated with anemia of chronic disease Anemia that is often observed in patients with infectious inflammatory or neoplastic disease that persists for more than 1 or 2 months is called anemia of chronic disease. - The characteristic feature of this group is occurrence of anemia in the presence of ample storage iron. The erythrocytes in anemia of chronic disease are usually normocytic and nonnochronic, however hypochromia and microcytosis may also be observed. The morphological features are determined by the primary disease. - \"For instance many patients with cancer have anemia that is typically normocytic and normochromic. In contrast patients with long standing active rheumatoid ahritis or chronic infections such as tuberculosis will have a microc tic hypochromic anemia\". The key pathological feature in anemia of chronic disease is failure to mobilize stored irony (ferritin). Ferritin is present in the macrophages of bone marrow and reticuloendothelial system. Under normal circumstances, iron can be mobilized back from the ferritin into the circulation. When developing erythrocytes require iron, the iron stored as ferritin is presented to the plasma from where it is carried to the developing erythrocytes. Why there is failure of iron mobilization in anemia of chronic disease? Anemia of chronic disease occurs in ceain inflammatory conditions or chronic disease. In these conditions macrophages are activated and they release ceain cytokines e. g. IF, IL-1, TNF. These cytokines stimulate synthesis of hepcidin in the liver. Increased hepcidin synthesis inhibits release of iron from the storage pool. Thus in anemia of chronic diseases, the macrophages, despite being rich in stored iron cannot provide iron to developing erythrocyte. The other impoant effect of cytokines released by rnacrophages in chronic inflammatory disorders is inhibition of CFUE (colony forming units erythroid). The inhibition leads to decreased synthesis of erythropoletin which in turn decreases erythropoiesis and produces anemia.

        "exp": "Ans. C i. e. Polio Hand knee gait Extend of the paralysis in the lower limbs determines the walking ability of the patient with poliomyelitis. When one leg has a normal or nearly normal muscles power, and some residual power in the antigravity muscles (gluteus maximus, quadriceps, and triceps surae) of the other limb, the patient can walk without external suppo. If the flexion contracture develops in the knee joint of the effected limb, they often assume a hand-knee gait. Normally, the knee joint extends at heel strike, if it is unable to extend because of a weak quadriceps (unstable knee gait) or if the knee is fused in flexion, the patient will try to push it into extension with his hand. The hand-knee gait causes lurch in the limbs, which is tiring and painful. Many Patients fall down frequently and suffer injuries and fractures. Some abnormal gait patterns & causes Cerebellar - think drunk people. - Wide base/reeling on a narrow base; - Patient falls to side of lesion; - Feet raised excessively and placed down carefully. - The cerebellum deals with fine control. - Seen in any lesion of the cerebellum. - There are a whole heap of causes but these are the most impoant: CVA, alcohol, tumour, MS (multiple sclerosis) High-stepping - this is foot-drop. - Remember the \"heel-on, toe-off\" from above? - It's the opposite. - Foot doesn't dorsiflex before touching the ground. - In order to not trip over, patient need to lift it really high. - It dangles (hence \"foot-drop\") and lands toes-first. Causes include? Local: common peroneal nerve palsy, sciatic nerve palsy, distal myopathy; spine: L4, 5 root lesion; Generalised: peripheral neuropathy (alcohol, diabetes), motor neurone disease. Parkinsonian - this type of gait has a lot of specific features but the mains ones are: TRAPS- Resting tremor, Rigidity, Akinesia, Stooping posture, Shuffling gait - Mainly seen in idiopathic parkinson's disease. Sensory ataxia - broad base, bangs feet down clumsily (may have foot-drop), looks at feet throughout gait cycle. - Positive Romberg's sign.; - Generalised: peripheral neuropathy; - Spinal cord: cervical spondylosis, MS, B12/folate deficiency and bizarrely syphillis. Scissor - typical of cerebral palsy. - Walking on tip-toes (plantar flexed feet), flexed kneed, adducted and internally rotated hip, ridigity, excessive adduction in leg swing and contractures in all spastic muscles. Waddling - broad-base; duck-like waddle; - Pelvis tilts away from lifted leg; - Forward curvature of lumbar spine; and - Marked body swing. - CDH, proximal myopathy, being overweight and being pregnant Antalgic - patient leans on affected side taking rapid, heavy step. - The step on the unaffected side is slower.

        "exp": "Adriamycin based chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen depending on.... Stage I & II breast cancers (Early invasive breast cancers) are managed by 1) Primary therapy for local management & 2) Adjuvant therapy Primary therapy consists of: - Mastectomy with assessment of axillary lymph node status (or modified radical mastectomy) Or - Breast conservation (lumpectomy, wide local excision or quadrantectorny) with assessment of axillary lymph node status + radiotherapy. Various trials have found both these methods to be equally effective. Breast conservation is the preferred form of treatment because of cosmetic advantages However there are ceain contraindications for conservative surgery (described in subsequent question) Management of axillary lymph nodes Earlier dissection of axillary lymph nodes (level l and II) was performed to assess the lymph node status (i. e. presence or absence of occult metastasis) Now Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered the standard for evaluation of the axillary lymph nodes for metastasis in women who have clinically negative lymph nodes. (the sentinel lymph node is the first regional lymph node to receive tumor cells that metastasize along the lymphatic pathway from the primary breast cancer) Axiltary Lymph node dissection is performed for clinically palpable axillary lymphnodes or metastatic disease detected in sentinel lymph node biopsy. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node negative cancers if > I cm in size node negative cancer >. 5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion high nuclear grade high histological grade HER 2/neu overexpression negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive tumors. HER-2/neu expression is determined for all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and may be used to provide prognostic information in patients with node-negative breast cancer and predict the relative efficacy of various chemotherapy regimens. Trastuzumab is the HER-2/neu-targeted agent that is added to the adjuvant therapy is the tumor shows overexpression of HER-2/neu receptors. Advanced Local-Regional Breast Cancer (Stage III) (Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + MRM + adjuvant radiation therapy + chemotherapy + antiestrogen therapy) Here the disease is advanced on the chest wall or in regional lymph nodes (or both), with no evidence of metastasis to distant sites. Such patients are recognized to be at significant risk for the development of subsequent metastases, and treatment addresses the risk for both local and systemic relapse. In an effo to provide optimal local-regional disease-free survival as well as distant disease-free survival for these women, surgery is integrated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (administration of therapeutic agents prior to the main treatment) should be considered in the initial management of all patients with locally advanced stage III breast cancer. Surgical therapy for women with stage HI disease is usually a modified radical mastectomy, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Antiestrogen therapy (tamoxifen) is added for hormone receptor positive tumors. Chemotherapy is used to maximize distant disease-free survival, whereas radiation therapy is used to maximize local-regional disease-free survival. In selected patients with stage LIIA cancer, neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy can reduce the size of the primary cancer and permit breast-conserving surgery. Distant Metastases (Stage IV) (mainly palliative treatment) Treatment for stage IV breast cancer is not curative but may prolong survival and enhance a woman's quality of life. Hormonal therapies that are associated with minimal toxicity are preferred to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Appropriate candidates for initial hormonal therapy include women with hormone receptor-positive cancers: women with bone or soft tissue metastases only; and women with limited and asymptomatic visceral metastases. Systemic chemotherapy is indicated for women with hormone receptor-negative cancers, symptomatic visceral metastases, and hormone-refractory metastases. Bisphosphonates, which may be given in addition to chemotherapy or hormone therapy, should be considered in women with bone metastases. About Adjuvant Therapy Adjuvant therapy is the use of systemic therapy (chemotherapy or/and hormone therapy) in patients who have received local therapy but are at risk of relapse. The objective is to eliminate the occult metastasis responsible for late recurrences while they are microscopic and theoretically most vulnerable to anticancer agents. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node negative cancers if > 1 cm in size node negative cancer >. 5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion - high nuclear grade - high histological grade HER 2/neu overexpression negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive. The use of chemotherapy in post-menopausal women is controversial. In post menopausal women, chemotherapy is frequently used upto age 70 yrs, if she can tolerate it. In older women, chemotherapy is performed less frequently. - In estrogen positive tumors, in postmenopausal women, antiestrogen (tamoxifen/ aromatase inhibitors) therapy is the preferred form of adjuvant systemic treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy - it involves the administration of adjuvant therapy before primary therapy (surgery & radiation therapy) - it has shown to down-stage the tumor. Previously CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate & 5-fluorouracil) was the chemotherapeutic regimen of choice. \"CMF is no longer considered adequate adjuvant chemotherapy and modern regimens include an anthracycline ( doxorubicin or epirubicin) and the newer agents such as the taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel)\"- Bailey and Lore 25/e p844 Anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy (Traztuzumab) HER-2/neu expression for all newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer is now recommended.
