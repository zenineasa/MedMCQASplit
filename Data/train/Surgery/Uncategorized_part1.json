        "exp": "Urine microscopy for malignant cytology \"Painless haematuria is by far the most common symptom of bladder cancer and should be regarded as indicative of a bladder carcinoma until proven otherwise. \" Bailey & Love 25/e p1336 (24/e p1363) Cigarette smoking is the main etiological factor and accounts, for about 50% of bladder cancers Among the given options 'urine microscopy' is the best choice for investigating a pt. with high suspicion for bladder ca. This is not a good screening test but a positive result is highly specific. The best investigation would be cystoscopy & biopsy. Investigations for bladder cancer 1. Urinary cytology - Exfoliated cells from both normal and neoplastic urothelium can be readily identified in voided urine. Examination of cytological specimens can detect the malignant cells either at the time of initial presentation or during follow-up. Cytological examination may be especially useful in screening high-risk population and assessing the response to treatment. 2. Cystourethroscopy and tumor resection - The diagnosis and initial staging of bladder cancer is made by cystoscopy and transurethral resection. 3. Imaging (IVP, CT, MRI) - Although various imaging techniques can detect bladder cancer, its presence is confirmed by cystoscopy & biopsy. - Therefore imaging modalities are used to image the upper urinary tract and, when infiltrating bladder tumors are detected to assess the depth of muscle wall infiltration and the presence of local & distant metastasis. - Intravenous urography remains one of the most common imaging tests for the evaluation of hematuria. However, intravenous pyelography is increasingly being replaced by computed tomography (CT) urography, which is more accurate, for evaluation of the entire abdominal cavity, renal parenchyma, and ureters in patients with hematuria. Bladder tumors may be recognized as pedunculated, radiolucent filling defects projecting into the lumen; nonpapillary, infiltrating tumors may result in fixation or flattening of the bladder wall. 4. Urinary tumor markers - - Several new tests have been developed in order to overcome the shocomings of urinary cytology such as the low sensitivity for low-grade superficial tumors and inter-observer variability. - Commercially available tests include, the BTA test, the BTA stat test, the BTA TRAK assay determination of urinary nuclear matrix protein (NMP22), Immunocyt and Uro. Vysion. - These tests can detect cancer specific proteins in urine (BTA/NMP22) or augment cytology by identifying cell surface or cytogenetic markers in the nucleus. Other tests under investigation include identification of the Lewis X antigen on exfoliated urothelial cells, and the determination of telomerase activity in exfoliated cells. - These tests have been demonstrated to enhance detection of bladder cancer when used either individually or in combination with cytology. They have been used to detect both new index tumors as well as recurrent tumors.",

A: Ankylosing Spondylitis The basic pathologic lesion of ankylosing spondylitis occurs at the entheses, which are sites of attachment to bone of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules. Enthesopathy results from inflammation, with subsequent calcification and ossification at and around the entheses. Inflammation with cellular infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is associated with erosion and eburnation of the subligamentous bone. The process usually stas at the sacroiliac joints. Other enthesopathic sites include the iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, patella, and calcaneum. Ankylosing spondylitis/ AS/ Bechterew's disease/ Bechterew syndrome/ Marie Strumpell disease/Spondyloahritis is a chronic, painful, degenerative inflammatory ahritis primarily affecting spine and sacroiliac joints, causing eventual fusion of the spine. AS is a systemic rheumatic disease and one of the seronegative spondyloahropathies. About 90% of the patients express the HLA-B27 genotype. Men are affected more than women by a ratio in excess of 10: 1. Typical signs of progressed AS are the visible formation of syndesmophytes on X-rays and abnormal bone outgrowths similar to osteophytes affecting the spine. Complete fusion results in a complete rigidity of the spine, a condition known as bamboo spine. In 40% of cases, ankylosing spondylitis is associated with iridocyclitis causing eye pain and photophobia. 4. 1 AS is also associated with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and Reiter's disease Other complications are aoic regurgitation, Achilles tendinitis, AV node block and amyloidosis & restrictive lung disease. A clinical examination and X-ray studies of the spine, which show characteristic spinal changes and sacroiliitis, are the major diagnostic tools. The Schober's test is a useful clinical measure of flexion of the lumbar spine performed during examination.",

Now instead of causing salivary secretion from the parotid, they cause secretion from the sweat glands. The condition can be treated by tympanic neurectomy which intercepts these parasympathetic fibres at the level of middle ear. Some people like to place a sheet of fascia lata between the skin and the underlying fat to prevent secretomotor fibres reaching the sweat glands. Generally, no treatment other than reassurance is required in most of these patients. Also known as Crocodile tears (gustatory lacrimation): There is unilateral lacrimation with mastication. This is due to faulty regeneration of parasympathetic fibres which now supply lacrimal gland instead of the salivary glands.

        "exp": "Ans is A (Maximum risk is within 1 year of splenectomy) Overwhelming Postsplenectomy Infection (OPSI) Splenectomised patients are likely to suffer from severe infections. This syndrome is called overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI). OPSI is among the more devastating sequelae of asplenia and is the most common fatal late complication of splenectomy. The loss of the spleen's ability to filter and phagocytose bacteria and parasitized blood cells predisposes the patient to infection by encapsulated bacteria or parasites. Splenectomy also results in the loss of a significant source of antibody production. Infection may occur at any time after splenectomy; in one recent series, most infections occurred more than 2 years after splenectomy, and 42% occurred more than 5 years after splenectomy. \"- Sabiston I8/e The risk for OPSI is greater after splenectomy for malignancy or hematologic disease than for trauma. The risk also appears to be greater in young children (<4 years of age). OPSI may begin with a relatively mild-appearing prodrome, including fever, malaise, myalgias, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These symptoms may then progress rapidly to fulminant bacteremic septic shock, with accompanying hypotension, anuria, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coma, and death within hours of presentation. The moality rate is between 50% and 70% for fully developed OPSI despite antibiotics and intensive care. Survivors often have a long and complicated hospital course with severe sequelae, such as peripheral gangrene requiring amputation, deafness from meningitis, mastoid osteomyelitis, bacterial endocarditis, and cardiac valvular destruction. S. pneumoniae is the most frequently involved organism in OPSI and is estimated to be responsible for between 50% and 90% of cases. Other organisms involved in OPSI include Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus species and other pneumococcal species, Salmonella species, and Capnocytophaga canimorsus (implicated in OPSI as a sequela of dog bites). Currently, the standard of care for postsplenectomy patients includes immunization within 2 weeks of splenectomy with: - polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23), - H. influenzae type b conjugate, and - meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine Antibiotic prophylaxis--usually a single daily dose of penicillin or amoxicillin--is recommended for asplenic children.

Frequent episodes of lymphangitis and cellulitis may occur. this is believed to be due to loss of local immune defence mechanism. Chronic eczema, a fungal infection of the skin (dermatophytosis) and nails (onychomycosis), fissuring, verrucae and papillae (warts) are frequently seen in advanced disease. Rarely malignancy (lymphangiosarcoma or angiosarcoma) may occur in chronic lymphoedema. This neoplastic transformation of blood vessels and lymphatics is called Stewart - Treves syndrome.",

DCIS is often first detected on mammogram as microcalcifications (tiny calcium deposits). With early detection, the five-year survival rate for DCIS is nearly 100%, provided that the cancer has not spread past the milk ducts to the fatty breast tissue or any other regions of the body. There are several different types of DCIS. For example, ductal comedocarcinoma refers to DCIS with necrosis (areas of dead or degenerating cancer cells). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC): IDC is also known as invasive ductal carcinoma. IDC begins in the milk ducts of the breast and penetrates the wall of the duct, invading the fatty tissue of the breast and possibly other regions of the body.

Obesity has a profound effect on overall health and life expectancy. The morbidly obese are predisposed to developing serious weight-related comorbidities, including hypertension, CAD, adult onset DM, sleep apnea and/or obesity hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, hypercoagulability, hyperlipidemia, and depression among others. Physiological abnormalities resulting from OSA include hypoxemia, hypercapnia, pulmonary and systemic vasoconstriction, and secondary polycythemia (from recurrent hypoxemia). These result in an increased risk of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. Right ventricular failure can occur from hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Obesity is now considered to be the second leading cause of preventable death behind cigarette smoking. The incidence of comorbidities and moalities is directly related to the degree of obesity. in a study with 12 year follow up, moalities rates for those weighing 50% over average weight were doubled. Moalities and morbidities is largely attributable to the comorbidities of obesity. Ref: Schwaz 9/e, Page 1743.",

Buerger's (Thromboangitis obliterans) Usual victims of this ds are young men below 40 yrs of age, who are smokers (ds is not seen in females and nonsmokers).

Vasodilatation increases local blood flow to the wounded area, supplying the cells and substrate necessary for fuher wound repair. The vascular endothelial cells also deform, increasing vascular permeability. The vasodilatation and increased endothelial permeability is mediated by histamine, PGE2, and prostacyclin as well as growth factor VEGF (vascular endothelial cell growth factor).

D: Instrumentation Instrumentation is by far the most common cause of perforation Boerhaave syndrome/Esophageal perforation, is rupture of the esophageal wall caused by excessive vomiting in eating disorders such as bulimia although it may rarely occur in extremely forceful coughing or other situations, such as obstruction by food. It can cause pneumomediastinum and/or mediastinitis (air or inflammation of the mediastinum) and sepsis. Boerhaave syndrome is a transmural perforation of the esophagus, distinct from Mallory-Weiss syndrome, a nontransmural esophageal tear also associated with vomiting. The term is useful for distinguishing it from iatrogenic perforation, which accounts for 85-90% of cases of esophageal rupture, typically as a complication of an endoscopic procedure, feeding tube, or unrelated surgery. It is associated with \"Mackler's triad\" which consists of vomiting, lower thoracic pain and subcutaneous emphysema which the later can be heard as Haman's crunch on physical examination. The most common anatomical location of the tear in Boerhaave syndrome is at left posterolateral wall of the lower third of the esophagus, 2-3 cm before the stomach.",

There is no cure for Raynaud'ssyndrome, thus all treatments mainly palliate symptoms and decrease the severity and, perhaps, frequency of attacks.

The remaining 10% of patients with more persistent or severe syndromes can be treated with a variety of vasodilatory drugs. Calcium-channel blockers such as diltiazem and nifedipine are the drugs of choice.

The release of various hormones, creates an altered metabolic state which helps the individual to survive through the injury or the adverse circumstances. The neuroendocrine response begins with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hypothalmic activation leads to - ADH (or vasopressin) release from the neurohypophysis epinephrine secretion from the adrenal medulla norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve endings - CRH travels to adenohypophysis, stimualting ACTH production. ACTH acts on adrenal coex, producing coisol release (ACTH also stimulates release of aldosterone from the adrenal coex) About other hormones Insulin - hormones and inflammatory mediators associated with stress response inhibit insulin release. This is required to achieve the hyperglycemic state after injury.

Definitive diagnosis is made by synol fluid polarised light microscopy which shows weakly positive, birefringent, rhomboid crystals of CPPD. In acute synovitis form, leucocytosis (thousands to 1 lac cells/g1) is seen in synol fluid examination. It may be associated with ceain underlying disease such as? - Primary hyperparathyroidism - Hemochromatosis - Hypomagnesemia - Hypophosphatasia - Hypothyroidism Pseudogout can be differentiated from gout as follows - Gout Pseudogout Smaller joints Large joints Intense pain Moderate pain Joint inflammed Swollen joint Hyperuricemia Chondrocalcinosis Uric acid crystals Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate crystal Treatment The treatment of pseudogout is the same as that of acute gout: rest and high dose anti-inflammatory therapy.

The tarsal tunnel is bounded superficially by the flexor retinaculum (laciniate ligament). The tibial nerve may be constricted by pressure from without or within this tunnel. Sources of constriction beneath and adjacent to the tarsal tunnel include bone fragments from displaced distal tibial, talar, or calcaneal fractures; tenosynovitis or ganglia of an adjacent tendon sheath; and bone and soft-tissue encroachment in rheumatoid ahritis or ankylosing spondylitis, varicosities, neural tumor (neurilemoma) or perineural fibrosis. Compression of the nerve leads to pain and sensory disturbances over the plantar surface of the foot. The pain may be precipitated by prolonged weight bearing. It is often worse at night and the patient may seek relief by walking around or stamping his or her foot. Paraesthesia and numbness can also be seen. Tinel's percussion test over the posterior tibial nerve may be positive. imaging Studies and Special Tests: Electromyography and nerve conduction studies should be performed but can be normal early in the entrapment. MRI provides excellent visualization of the tarsal tunnel and is indicated if there is suspicion of a space-occupying lesion within the tunnel. Treatment is conservative with ohotic modifications and measures to decrease the inflammation surrounding the involved nerve. A medial arch suppo can be fitted to hold the foot in slight varus.

C: Hypospadias is a premalignant lesion Following as risk factors for penile cancer: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, smoking, smegma, phimosis, treatment of psoriasis, age, and AIDS. The other etiologic factor most commonly associated with penile carcinoma is poor hygiene. Lichen sclerosus (also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans) may also be a risk factor. Symptoms Redness, irritation and a sore or a lump on the penis. Pathology Precancerous Dermatologic Lesions Carcinoma in Situ (Bowen Disease, Erythroplasia of Queyrat) Invasive Carcinoma of the Penis A Squamous cell carcinoma usually originating in the glans or foreskin is by far the most common type, occurring in 9 out of 10 cases. Staging The stages are assessed as follows: Stage I - Cancer has only affected the glans and/or foreskin. Stage II - Cancer has spread to the shaft of the penis. Stage III - Cancer has affected the penis and surrounding lymph nodes. Stage IV - Cancer has moved beyond the groin area to other pas of the body. Recurrent - Cancer that has returned after treatment. The most common treatment is one of five types of surgery: Wide local excision - The tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue are removed Microsurgery - Surgery performed with a microscope is used to remove the tumor and as little healthy tissue as possible Laser surgery - laser light is used to burn or cut away cancerous cells Circumcision - cancerous foreskin is removed Amputation (penectomy) - a paial or total removal of the penis, and possibly the associated lymph nodes. This is the most common and effective treatment. Radiation therapy is usually used adjuvantly with surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence. With earlier stages of penile cancer, a combination of topical chemotherapy and less invasive surgery may be used. More advanced stages of penile cancer usually require a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.",

False localizing signs occur in two major contexts: as a consequence of raised intracranial pressure, and with spinal cord lesions. Cranial nerve palsies (especially sixth nerve palsy), hemiparesis, sensory features (such as truncal sensory levels), and muscle atrophy, May all occur as false localizing signs. Sixth nerve palsies are the most common false-localizing sign of raised intracranial pressure. In one series of 101 cases of IIH, 14 cases were noted, 11 unilateral and 3 bilateral. Sixth nerve palsy, or abducens nerve palsy, is a disorder associated with dysfunction of cranial nerve VI (the abducens nerve), which is responsible for contracting the lateral rectus muscle to abduct (i. e., turn out) the eye. The inability of an eye to turn outward results in a convergent strabismus or esotropia of which the primary symptom is double vision or diplopia in which the two images appear side-by-side.

Self limiting & good prognosis - International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) has advocated the term complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS-1) for reflex sympathetic dystrophy and term complex regional pain syndrome type 2 (CRPS-2) to describe causalgia or similar signs and symptoms associated with a known peripheral nerve injury. - So the main difference between CRPS-1 (RSD, Sudceck's osteodystrophy) and CRPS-2 (Causalgia) is etiology. CRPS type 1 being associated with a soft tissue injury or immobilization while CRPS type II follows a peripheral nerve injury. - Presence of delayed onset, out of propoion, severe persistent, burning pain, decreased range of motion (stiffness), and shiny skin (trophic changes), erythematous & cyanotic discoloration 4 weeks to 2 months after sustaining soft tissue injury (ankle sprain) or bony injury (Colle's fracture) suggest a diagnosis of CRPS type 1 (i. e. reflex sympathetic dystrophy). Prolonged disuse results in muscle atrophy, joint stiffness or contracture, and osteopenia and leads to prolonged recovery (poor prognosis). Sympathetectomy (eg stellate ganglion block) may be used for treatment. It is a group of vague painful conditions observed as a sequelae of trauma. The trauma is some times relatively minor and signs and symptoms are out of propoion of the trauma. It is characterized by pain, hyperaesthesia, swelling, stiffness, discolouration, and trophic changes wihich are out of propoion to the inciting eventQ The most characteristic symptom is pain out of propoion to the inciting event in both severity and duration. It is often burning in characterQ. Hence the term 'Causalgia' which means burning pain. - Due to hypeaesthsia to light touch, patients often withdraw when one attempts to examine the affected extremity - Swelling is the most consistent physical findingQ. It often begins in area of injury and is soft initially, as the process continues, oedema gradually becomes firm and involve much broader area. - Stiffness and discolouration of skin (red, blue & /or pallor)Q are other classic signs. - Trophic skin changes i. e. skin is shiny, thin with loss of normal wrinkles and creasesQ are characteristically seen late. - The most common radiographic finding is localized osteopeniaQ d/t increased blood flow to the bone - Prognosis is directly related to the time to diagnosis and initiation of therapy. The goal is to break abnormal sympathetic reflex and to restore motion. - The abnormal sympathetic response is interrupted by the use of sympatholytic drugs eg. a - adrenergic blockers, local somatic nerve blocks, (Bier's block, axillary block), stellate ganglion blocks, or surgical sympathetectomyQ - Physical therapy is of crucial impoance. Active and passive range of motion should be performed to the level of discomfo but not pain - Recovery is prolonged & painful both for patient and surgeon. 3 years usually elapse before the bones are remineralized & it is rare that full range of movements returns. In absence of major nerve damage diagnosis is CRPS-1 If major nerve damage is present & pain is limited to a single peripheral nerve the diagnosis is CRPS 2. CRPS Type 1: Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy/ Sudeck's Osteoneuro Dystrophy - Pain after an (often minor) noxious event or immobilization (+-) - Continuing spontaneous pain or allodynia/hyperalgesia dispropoionate to the inciting event and not limited to a single peripheral nerve. - Edema, skin blood flow abnormality or abnormal pseudomotor activity at sometime in region of pain. - Excluded by conditions that otherwise account for the degree of pain and dysfunction.

Insulinomas are the most common pancreatic endocrine neoplasms. The symptoms are produced due to excessive secretion of insulin causing hypoglycemia Most of the insulinomas are solitary and benign, Only about 10-15% of insulinomas are malignant. (keep in mind that all other endocrine tumours of pancreas are usually malignant). Symptoms of insulinoma The most common symptom is due to the effect of hypoglycemia on the central nervous system. These symptoms are - confusion, disorientation, visual difficulties, irrational behaviour, coma Other symptoms are due to increased secretion of catecholamines which includes sweating, tremor and palpitations. Classic diagnostic criteria is - Whipple's triad Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia during fasting. Blood glucose below 2. 8 mmol/L (50mg/dl) during symptomatic episodes. Relief of symptoms by intravenous administration of Glucose. The most useful diagnostic test and the only one indicated in almost all patients is demonstration Wasting hypoglycemia in the presence of inappropriately high level of insulin. The patient is fasted for 72 hrs or till the symptoms of hypoglycemia develop. When hypoglycemia develops, serum level of insulin is measured. A ratio of plasma insulin to glucose > 0. 3 is diagnostic. Localization of the tumour Once the diagnosis has been made, localization of the tumour is must for surgery. The most important examination for localization of tumour is intraoperative ultrasound, which can indentify pancreatic tumour in all cases. It is more sensitive than any other method Other important methods of localization - High resolution CT and MN. Endoscopic ultrasound examination of pancreas. Selective arteriography T/T - Surgical excision is the t/t of choice - Since most insulinomas are benign simple enucleation is done.",

Patients may develop vomiting, which may be projectile but non-bilious in nature, nausea or abdominal pain. An unusual finding that may lead to the diagnosis is the succussion splash, a splash-like sound heard over the stomach in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen on shaking the patient, with or without the stethoscope. The diagnosis is typically made by X-ray, which will show an absent air bubble in the stomach, or by CT scan. Causes of gastric outlet obstruction include peptic ulcer disease; tumours of the stomach, including adenocarcinoma (and its linitis plastica variant), lymphoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumours; infections, such as tuberculosis; and infiltrative diseases, such as amyloidosis. Metabolic alkalosis may develop as a result of loss of acid. Traditionally severe cases of Gastric outlet obstruction are treated usually by a gastroenterostomy rather than a pyloroplasty. Truncal vagotomy leads to reduction of the maximal acid output by 50% as vagus nerves are sectioned which critically controls the secretion of gastric acid.",

Thrombolytics have been described in the acute early phase. Most patients can be managed with conservative treatment. Recurrent episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by venous hypertension should be treated with splenectomy. Pathogenesis It has been proposed that pancreatic elastase damages the vessels, leading to pseudoaneurysm formation. Clinical Features Spontaneous rupture results in massive bleeding. Clinical manifestations include sudden onset of abdominal pain, tachycardia, and hypotension. Treatment If possible, arterial embolization should be attempted to control the bleeding. Refractory cases require ligation of the affected vessel. The mortality ranges from 28-56%. MC affected vessel in acute pancreatitis: Splenic artery (pseudoaneusysm formation).

Intestinal pseudo-obstruction it's the most likely diagnosis, as air-fluid levels are not seen in it. Harrison writes - \"The symptom of chronic pseudo-obstruction are chronic or intermittent constipation, crampy abdominal pain, anorexia and bloating. Abdominal x-rays reveal gaseous distention of the large and small bowel and occasionally of the stomach. Air-fluid levels are unusual and should raise the possibility of mechanical obstruction. \" Acute pseudoobstruction involves only the colon and presents with features of colonic obstruction (as described before). Air-fluid level is also not a feature of colonic obstruction. About the fluid levels remember the following points up to 3 to 5 fluid levels less than 2. 5 cm in length may be normal. multiple air-fluid levels are a feature of mechanical small intestinal obstruction and paralytic liens.

'The longer (the stump) the better', is the general rule for amputation at all sites, but below knee amputation is an exception. The amputation level is kept proximal to the lower third of tibia, since the preponderance of tendinous structures in the lower third predispose to poor circulation and an unstable painful lump. The best level below the knee as, for, as prosthetic fitting is concerned is at the distal musculotendinous junction of the gastrocnemius muscle. Some other imp. points about BK amputation The fibula is transected slightly above the tibial level. No essential differences in healing rate is noted in pts. with or without popliteal pulses, but the absence of a femoral pulse is associated with a high failure rate for BK amputation.

        "question": "A 58 year old male alcoholic with chronic pancreatitis develops a palpable abdominal mass. Ultrasound reveals a 9 cm cystic lesion adjacent to the pancreas. An impoant complication that might occur if this cyst ruptured would be?",
        "exp": "The patient most likely has a pancreatic pseudocyst, which is a complication of pancreatitis. Pancreatic pseudocyst is not a true cyst; it is lined by granulation tissue and collagen. It contains pancreatic juices and lysed blood, so rupture would spill the active digestive enzymes onto the adjacent viscera, paicularly the stomach, small intestine, and transverse colon. Digestive action produces potentially severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Anaphylactic shock results from massive activation of the IgE-mediated branch of the immune system. Pancreatic secretions do not elicit an IgE response. The classic abdominal cyst that ruptures, producing anaphylactic shock, is a hydatid cyst. Carcinomatosis is widespread serosal spread of a carcinoma, typically due to tumor spillage into a body cavity. Although this may occur with pancreatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, this disease is far less likely to occur than is pancreatic pseudocyst in a patient with chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic pseudocyst is not an infective disease. Although septic abscesses do occur in the abdomen, and may even complicate a pancreatic pseudocyst, the danger of rupture is more associated with tissue destruction by pancreatic enzymes than with infection.

        "question": "Post transplant lymphoma is?",
        "exp": "B cell Nearly 1 to 20% of people who receive a solid organ transplant develop a lymphoma. - Lymphomas have also been repoed (though less. frequently) after bone-marrow transplants. for other disorders. Why does it happen? - Post-transplant lymphomas are almost always related to infection by the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). - Infection by the Epstein Barr Virus causes a transformation of B-cells which becomes cancerous. In normal individuals other cells of the immune system can tackle the EBV infection, but for organ transplants high doses of drugs that suppress the immune system must be administered. With nothing to control the infection, the chances of developing lymphomas increase. The two main factors that determine the chances of getting lymphoma are: How much immunosuppressive treatment is required - The more the immunosuppression, the more the chances of EBV infection. The status of EBV serology of the recipient of the transplant - If this individual has previously been infected by EBV the chances are that the body remembers the infection and the blood already has called antibodies that can identify and kill the virus. Clinical features Post-transplant lymphomas are usually different. from the usual Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. While most patients have involvement mainly of lymph nodes, other organs are very commonly affected as well. These include the brain, lungs and the intestines. The transplanted organ can also get involved. Treatment Whenever possible, immunosuppressive treatment has to be reduced or stopped. In those who have small and localized disease, surgery or radiation may be attempted. If not, the first line of treatment is usually Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets lymphoma cells. Only when this. fails is chemotherapy attempted. Chemotherapy is deferred until necessary as in paially immunosuppressed individuals, chemotherapy may fuher increase the risk of infections. In those who develop lymphomas after bone marrow transplants, donor leukocyte transfusions can be highly effective. Prognosis of Post transplant lymphomas In general, non-Hodgkin lymphomas occurring after organ transplants have a poorer outcome than other NHLs. Around 60-80% of the victims ultimately succumb to their lymphoma. Involvement of brain has poor prognosis",

        "question": "All of the following features in the knee are recognized to be consistent with a torn medial meniscus, except",
        "exp": "A i. e. Excessive - History of twisting strain (flexion, abduction/ valgus and medial rotation of femur on fixed tibia Q/ lateral rotation of tibia on fixed femur) followed by locking of knee pintQ is diagnostic of medial meniscus tear. - Mc Murray's test, Apley grinding test and Squat tests are done to diagnose meniscus (medial & lateral) injuryQ. - Excessive forward glide is d/t anterior cruciate ligament tear (not meniscus injury)Q. Meniscal tear is the commonest knee injury that require surgery. Medial meniscal tears are 3 times more common than lateral meniscus tears. Paial meniscetomy is done for tears not amenable to repair eg. cornpex, degenerative and central/ radical tearsQ. Meniscal repair should be done for all acute lateral/ peripheral tears especially in young patient undergoing concurrent ACL reconstructionQ. Meniscal Injury *Meniscus or semilunar cailage are relatively avascular structure with poor healing potentialQ. *Medial meniscus is larger and more oval than its fellow Medial meniscus is more frequently torn than the lateral because it is securely attached and less mobileQ where as lateral meniscus is more mobile and protected by action of popliteus muscle At bih entire meniscus is vascular; by age a months, the inner one third has become avascular. This decrease in vascularity continues by age 9 years, when the meniscus closely resembles the adult meniscus. In adults, only 10- 25% of lateral meniscus and 10- 30% of medial meniscus is vascular. Because of the avascular nature of inner two thirds of the meniscusQ; cell nutrition is believed to occur mainly through diffusion or mechanical pumping. So inner avascular meniscus once torn does not healQ. *The commonest type of medial meniscal injury in a young adult is the bucket handle tearQ (i. e. complete longitudinal tear). Other types are - flap tears, radial tears, complex tears etc *Ceain active spos- such as soccer, hockey, tennis, badminton, squash and skiing are commonly associated with meniscus injuries, paiculary when pivoting with all the weight on one leg with the knee flexed (i. e. twisting in flexed knee)Q. It used to be common in coal miners who had to stoop or squat in narrow seams with the knee joints flexed. *A common history is as follows: whilst involved in violent spoing activity or work with the knee in a position of flexion the patient suddenly sustains an outward twist of the foot or an inward twist of femur on the fixed foot. He immediately feels acute pain on anteromedial aspect of joint along with feeling of a tearing sensation and displacement of an internal structure. On attempting to rise, straightening of the knee is usually not possible (locking)Q *The meniscus may become completely displaced and locked between the femur and tibia, preventing full extension of the knee. More frequently the torn meniscus will cause pain, intermittent catching and occasionly locking as it flips into and out of the region of contact between the femur & the tibia. *In meniscal injury due to development of effusion (not hemahrosis) with in a few hours (not immediately) joint swells. It is impoant to note that swelling occuring immediately after injury, is d/t hemahrosis; which may be caused by an injury to cruciate or collateral ligaments or by an osteochondral fracture. The doughy feel of haemahrosis distinguishes ligment injuries from the fluctuant feel of the synol effusion of a meniscus injuryQ. *Symptoms include- joint line pain, catching, popping and lockingQ, usually and weakness & giving wayQ (instability) sometimes. Deep squatting and duck walking are usually painful. Joint line tendernessQ, pain with squatting, a positive flexion Mc Murry testQ. and positive Apley's compression-distraction testQ are all indicaive of meniscal injury. *Before the impoance of meniscus was understood and ahroscopy was available the meniscus was often removed entirely. But now attempts are made to remove only the torn poion of meniscus (if tear is in avascular poion), or repair the meniscus (in vascular peripheral poions if possible). Ahroscopy is the gold standard for making diagnosisQ and ahroscopic repair or removal is the treatment of choice. *Tears in the peripheral third of the meniscus, if small (< 15 mm), may heal spontaneously because this poion in adults has good blood supply. Larger tears require repair. Diagnostic Tests For Meniscal Injury - MC- Murray, Apley and Squat tests are useful tests to diagnose meniscal injury. All of them basically involve attempts to locate and reproduce crepitations, snaps or catches, either audible or detected by palpation that result as the knee is manipulated during flexion, extension and rotator motions of joint. Mn-\" MAS Tests\" -If these noises can be localized to the joint line (confirmed by palpation of posteromedial / posterolateral margin of joint), the meniscus most likely contains a tear. Whereas similar sounds from quadriceps mechanism, patella and patella femoral grove must be differentiated. Tears of one meniscus can produce pain in opposite compament of knee. This is most commonly seen with the posterior tears of lateral meniscus. Therefore these tests are valuable diagnostically but not diagnostic (confirmatory) and MRI or ahroscopy is needed for confirmation. Negative MAS tests do not rule of meniscal injury. Management of Meniscal Injury - Nonoperative management consists of groin to ankle cylinder cast or knee immobilizer worn for 4-6 weeks with crutch walking and toe touch down weight bearing. If symptoms recur after this, surgical repair or removal of damaged meniscus may be necessary and more specific diagnostic procedures (MRI, ahroscopy) are indicated. - Complete removal of meniscus is only justifiable when it is irreparably torn, and the meniscus rim should be preserved if at all possible. Total meniscetomy is better avoided in young athletes or people whose daily activity requires vigorous use of knee. Excision of only torn poion (paial, sub total meniscetomy) are better procedures. - Ideal indication for meniscal repair is an acute, 1 to 2 cm, longitudinal, peripheral tear that is repaired in conjunction with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in a young individual. Peripheral 1/3rd to 1/4th meniscus is vascular enough to provide vascular granulation tissue that results in healing of meniscal tears in this zone. Miller-Warner & Harrier categorized tears a/ t there location in 3 zones of vascularity: red - red, fully within peripheral vascular zone; red-white, at the border of vascular area; and white -white, within the central avascular area. They recommended repair of red-red and red white tears. Likelihood of healing or reparability, depends on several other factors in addition to vascularity specifically type of tear, chronicity and size (in same order), Longitudinal -acute and small tears heal better than radial/ flap type - chronic and large tears. In cruciate ligament injury the findings can be somewhate perverse i. e. with a complete tear the patients may have little or no pain, whereas with a paial tear the knee is painful. Swelling also is worse with paial tears, because haemorrhage remains confined with in the joint; with complete tears ruptured capsule permits leakage and diflusion. Paial tears permit no abnormal movement, but the attempt cause pain. Complete tears permit abnormal movement which sometimes is painless.",

Indications of Surgical intervention: (Ref: Bailey and Love 25/e 1145; CSDT 13/e p583; Harrison 17/e p) i) Age of cyst more than 12 weeks without resolution ii) Size of cyst greater than 6 cm. iii) Symptomatic iv) Development of complications (eg. haemorrhage, perforation, g. i. obstruction) But note that these indications for intervention are just a generalization used for teaching the undergraduates. These are not specific indications for interventions. Therapeutic interventions are advised (irrespective of size and duration) when - the pseudocyst is symptomatic or - increasing is size on follow up studies, or - any complication (rupture, hemorrhage, or abscess) arise or - there is suspicion of malignancy. Thus expectant management is adequate (irrespective of size) if the patient is asymptomatic and serial u/s studies show that the cyst is resolving. Surgical methods a) Internal Drainage - most preferred surgical management in uncomplicated pseudocyst is internal drainage. The three options are Cystojejunostomy Cystogastrostomy Cystoduodenostomy Internal drainage can be done either open surgical or laparascopic or by percutaneous catheter-based methods (transgastric puncture and stent placement to create a cystogastrostomy) b) Excision of Pseudocyst - is hardly done and is usually limited to pseudocyst involving the tail of the pancreas. c) External drainage - is done in:? - infected pseudocyst - for immature pseudocyst with thin nonfibrous walls that does not allow safe internal drainage. - in an unstable pt. in whom more complex surgical intervention is precluded. d) Transpapillary pancreatic duct stent: Because pseudocysts often communicate with the pancreatic ductal system, two newer approaches to pseudocyst management are based on main duct drainage, rather than pseudocyst drainage per se. A stent is passed into the pseudocyst through the papilla of Vater. this drainage, paicularly when incomplete, can allow bacteria to enter the pseudocyst and lead to development of an infected pseudocyst. Another transpapillary approach involves placing a stent across the duct defect rather than into the cyst through the defect. By excluding pancreatic juice from the pseudocyst, this bridging intraductal stent may permit the duct disruption to heal and the pseudocyst to resolve without drainage (analogous to the use of common bile duct stents in the setting of a cystic duct leak).",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Radioiodine Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is a well-differentiated tumor. In fact, FTC resembles the normal microscopic pattern of the thyroid. FTC originates in follicular cells and is the second most common cancer of the thyroid, after papillary carcinoma. Follicular and papillary thyroid cancers are considered to be differentiated thyroid cancers; together they make up 95% of thyroid cancer cases. Papillary/follicular carcinoma must be considered a variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (mixed form), and Huhle cell carcinoma should be considered a variant of FTC. Despite its well-differentiated characteristics, follicular carcinoma may be ovely or minimally invasive. In fact, FTC tumors may spread easily to other organs. The prognosis is better for younger patients than for patients who are older than 45 years. Patients with FTC are more likely to develop lung and bone metastases than are patients with papillary thyroid cancer. The bone metastases in FTC are osteolytic. Older patients have an increased risk of developing bone and lung metastases. The initial treatment for cancer of the thyroid is surgical. The exact nature of the surgical procedure to be performed depends for the most pa on the extent of the local disease. A total thyroidectomy is performed if the primary tumor is larger than 1 cm in diameter or if there is extrathyroidal involvement or distant metastases. Clinically evident lymphadenopathy should be removed with a neck dissection. If the primary tumor is less than 1 cm in diameter, a unilateral lobectomy might be considered. About 4-6 weeks after surgical thyroid removal, patients must have radioiodine to detect and destroy any metastasis and any residual tissue in the thyroid.",

The muscularis propria separates superficial disease from deeply (muscularis propria) invasive disease. Stage T2 and higher T stage tumors invade the muscularis propria, the true muscle of the bladder wall. If the tumor extends through the muscle to involve the full thickness of the bladder and into the serosa, it is classified as T3.

Acryl\u00ae) or 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (eg, Dermabond\u00ae, Surgiseal). Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives are liquid monomers that undergo an exothermic reaction on exposure to moisture (eg, on the skin surface), changing to polymers that form a strong tissue bond. When applied to a laceration, the polymer binds the wound edges together to allow normal healing of the underlying tissue. Compared with wounds closed with sutures, the tensile strength of wounds closed by tissue adhesives is less at the time of initial application, but equalizes by one week post-repair. Advantages: Less painful application, and sometimes no need for local anesthetic injection More rapid application and repair time Cosmetically similar results at 12 months post-repair Waterproof barrier Antimicrobial properties Better acceptance by patients No need for suture removal or follow-up Indications and contraindications: For use of tissue adhesives the wound needs to be clean, dry with near perfect hemostasis and under no tension. Complex stellate lesions or crush injuries should not be closed with tissue adhesives since good wound approximation is difficult to achieve. Tissue adhesives are not recommended for lacerations of the hands, feet, or joints, since repetitive movements could cause the adhesive bond to break before sufficient tensile strength is achieved. Tissue adhesives are not recommended for the oral mucosa or other mucosal surfaces or areas of high moisture such as the axillae and perineum. Lacerations involving the hairline or vermilion border require more precision, and should be repaired with traditional sutures.",

Post-CPR rib fractures are often bilateral. The site of rib fracture is dependent on: the position of the hands; force used; and method of chest compression (manual or device-assisted). The vast majority (90%+) offractures occur in ribs 2 to 7; fractures in the bony pas of rib numbers 1 and 8 to 10 are possible but probably very rare; it is difficult to see how fractures can occur in rib numbers 11 and 12 following standard manual CPR. The vast majority of fractures (90%+) occur in the anterior third of the bony pa of the rib, some occur in the middle third but - following standard manual CPR - none in the posterior third of the bony pa of the rib. Posterior rib fractures occur following automated band-type CPR. Lateral fractures i. e. those occurring between the anterior and posterior axillary lines, do occur after standard CPR. If a fracture is noted in rib numbers 10 to 12 or in the posterior third of the bony pa of a rib, then non-resuscitation trauma should be suspected. Chest x-ray is unreliable as a diagnostic tool for detecting rib fractures. CT is better than x-ray and may complement the post-moem detection of rib fractures. Fractures are more common On the left side of the chest With increasing age of the patient In females With increasing length of time of resuscitation attempts Following the involvement of untrained persons With the use of ACD-CPR",

Risk factors for pilonidal disease include male gender, hirsute individuals, Caucasians, sitting occupations, existence of a deep natal cleft, and presence of hair within the natal cleft.

        "exp": "Multiple sclerosis[Ref: Harrison 171h/e p. 2647; Harper 27th/e p. 38; Lippincott p. 20j The process of protein folding is remarkably efficient, but sometimes it can go wrong. Incorrectly folded proteins are considered to be the cause of many diseases. Amvloidoses The common characteristic of all amyloidoses is the collection of plaques of insoluble protein in the extracellular tissue which cannot be broken down by enzymes. Their ordered structure gives them a crystal like propeies and they are are made up of long filaments (fibrils) that are formed from densely packed p pleated sheets. There are about 20 different proteins that can act as the building block of these fibrils each of which is associated with a different disease. In the so called systemic amyloidoses, the precursors of these plaques are transpoed through the blood stream from their point of origin to the point of deposition. Localized amyloidoses are of greater clinical significance as they mainly affect the central nervous system, the extracellular tissue of which is paicularly susceptible to damage. Alzheimer's disease One of the main characteristics of Alzhiemer's disease is the accumulation of plaques of insoluble p amyloid in the brain. The p amyloid plaques are formed by cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two different enzymatic activities which release amyloid - p peptide fragments that are 40 or 42 amino acids long. These then form fibrils which aggregate into insoluble clumps of p amyloid plaques that surround neurons and cause damage. But this cleavage also occurs in healthy individuals and soluble p amyloid proteins are normal constituents of brain tissue. How, then do the plaques form in Alzhiemer's patients? It is thought that the, mis folding of the protein, dramatically alters its propeies. In the normal protein, hydrophobic amino acids bury themsleves inside the protein right from the sta of the folding. However, if the protein folds wrongly, these hydrophobic amino acids are exposed and they rapidly seek out and bind to hydrophobic groups on other protein molecules forming the insoluble aggregates or plaques that are found in Alzhiemers patients. Prion disease: Prion are fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by transmissible proteins and are characterized by spongiform changes, astrocytic gliomas and neuronal loss from the deposition of insoluble protein aggregates in neural cells. Prions are caused by human prion related protein (PrP) (a glycoprotein rich in a helix). PrP is endogenous to the host and in most people, the PrP protein folds normally leaving the person healthy. Rarely, a mutation in the PrP gene will allow the protein to be made incorrectly and it will fold incorrectly making a Pr. Psc prion. (Which is a glycoprotein rich in fi sheets). These Pr. Psc prions when exposed to PrP, which is in the process of folding will encourage that PrP to fold incorrectly too, thus creating another Pr. Psc. While PrP can be processed and cleaned out of a cell once it has been used, Pr. Psc is shaped differently enough so that it can't be cleaned out and it aggregates inside the cell. These Pr. Psc aggregates quickly builds up into plaques destroying the nervous tissue. Thus a pathological prion protein serves as the templates for the conformational transformation of normal PrP into Pr. Psc. Creutzfeldt Jabok disease is caused by prions. Other examples of disease caused by protein misfolding Huntingtons Parkinson's Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",

The pancreatic ductal epithelium undergoes atrophy, hyperplasia, and metaplasia at the site of the protein plugs. Chronic pancreatitis is a relapsing condition that presents with abdominal pain. As the disease progresses, the frequency and duration of episodes of abdominal pain increase. Consequently, narcotic addiction is a common problem because of the intractable pain. Weight loss and malabsorption are also common. Diabetes can develop in more than half of patients with chronic calcific pancreatitis. Diabetes tends to be brittle in these patients, probably because of the lack of both insulin and glucagon. However, patients with diabetes associated with chronic pancreatitis are less prone to complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, atherosclerosis, and ketoacidosis than are patients with primary diabetes.

Anorectal manometry measure the pressure of the internal anal sphincter while a balloon is distended in the rectum.

Among the given options, according to the table and text of Harrison (17/e chapter 'Infections in Transplant Recipients') Pneumocystis and RSV can cause pneumonia after transplant: but. Pneumocystis is a much more common than RSV. Common Sources of Infections after Hematopoietic Stein Cell Transplantation Period after Transplantation Infection Site Early (<1 Month) Middle (1-4 months) Late (>6 Months) Disseminated Aerobic gram-negative, grain-positive bacteria Nocardia Candida, Aspergillus Encapsulated bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis) Skin and mucous membranes HSV- HHV-6 VZV Lungs Candida, Aspergillus HSV CMV, seasonal respiratory viruses Pneumocystis Toxoplasma Pneumocystis Gastrointestinal tract CMV Kidney BK virus, adenovirus BK virus Brain HHV-6 Toxoplasma Toxoplasma JC virus Bone marrow HHV-6 Tree-in-bud sign The tree-in-bud sign is a finding seen on thin-section computed tomographic images of the lung (HRCT). (Not seen on X-rays) Peripheral, small, centrilobular nodules are connected to linear, branching opacities that have more than one contiguous branching site, thus resembling a budding or, fruiting tree: this is known as tree-in-bud-pattern. It represents dilated and impacted (mucus or pus-filled) centrilobular bronchioles. The presence of tree-in-bud is indicative of small airway disease. It is most commonly associated with endobronchial spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. But it can also be seen in a large number of conditions. Pulmonary infectious disorders involving the small airways are the most common causes of the tree-in-bud sign. Any infectious organism, including bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal agents, can involve the small airways and cause a tree-in-bud pattern.

However, 20% of infants are symptomatic from bih, and most are symptomatic within the first 2 months after bih. Non-bilious vomiting, becoming increasingly projectile, occurs over several days to weeks. Eventually the infant will develop a nearly complete obstruction by the second to fouh week of life and will not be able to hold down even clear liquids. This invariably proceeds to severe dehydration if not t/t. These infants develop a metabolic alkalosis with severe depletion of potassium and chloride ions. \" The diagnosis of pyloric stenosis usually can be made on physical examination by palpation of the typical 'olive' in the right upper quadrant and the presence of visible gastric waves on the abdomen.

        "exp": "Ans. B: Tibiofibular Joint I. Six types of synol joints are: Hinge Ball-and-socket Pivot Condyloid (angular or ellipsoidal) Plane (gliding) Saddle. - The elbow is an example of a hinge joint. Here, the convex and concave aiculating bones allow movement along one plane, similar to a door. -The shoulder and hip are the only ball-and-socket joints in the body. In this type of joint, one bone has a spherical head that aiculates with a corresponding concavity. This joint frees the joint to move in many directions. - In a pivot joint, one round-shaped aiculating bone fits within a corresponding depression on another bone. This joint allows one bone to rotate against the other. An example is the radioulnar joint (joint of the radius and ulna) in the forearm. - In a condyloid (angular) joint, one bone has an oval aiculating head that rests within an oval concavity. This joint permits angular movement of the bones. The metacarpophalangeal joint (junction between the metacarpals and phalanges) of the hand are examples of condyloid joints - Plane joints have two flat bones joined. The sole movement of the bones is sho gliding motions. An example of this joint is the intearsal joint (junction between the tarsal bones) of the feet. Saddle joint bones have convex and concave surfaces similar to a saddle. This joint allows the joint to move in many directions. The carpometacarpal joint of the thumb is an example saddle joint. II. As their name implies, amphiahrosis joints (slightly movable joints) have limited movement. The two types of amphiahrosis joints are: Syndesmosis (fibrous) Symphysis (cailaginous). - A Syndesmosis joint occurs when two bones join by a section of cailage. The junction between the tibia and fibula is an example. A symphysis joint forms when two bones fuse by a fibrocailage pad. Typical symphysis joints are between the pubic symphysis (pubic bones in the pelvis), and in the veebral column between individual veebrae. Interveebral discs act as weight-bearing shock absorbers for walking, jumping, and lifting. III. An immovable joint is called a synahrosis. The two types of this joint are: Sutures Gomphoses. - Sutures are joined by sho fibers of dense fibrous connective tissue and are in the skull. - The single example of a gomphosis joint is the teeth sitting within their sockets. IV. An example of a bony fusion joint is the fusion of the three bones forming a coxa (hip bone): the ilium, ischium, and pubis.",

Closed-angle glaucoma is more common among Asians. The Schijltz tonometer, due to the fact that it is inexpensive, is the most frequently used device to measure intraoccular pressure in the United States. It is used in both hospitals and outpatient clinics. b-Adrenergic antagonists are one of the more commonly used drugs and are initially staed as a topical agent. Unfounately, excess drug drains through the nasolacrimal duct into the nose and is absorbed into the systemic circulation. Therefore systemic side effects can occur and may be severe.

These fragment cells have shapes like triangular cells, helmet cells and are known as schistiocytes and are easily made out in a well made peripheral blood, film.

As the testis descends from its retroperitoneal position to beyond the internal ring, it carries with an anteromedial diveiculum of peritoneum (the processus vaginalis).
