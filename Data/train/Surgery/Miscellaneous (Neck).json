CYSTIC HYGROMA/LYM PH ANGIOMA* Cystic hygromas are multiloculated cystic swelling Filled with clear lymph lined by endothelial cells* It results due to sequestration of a portion of the jugular lymph sac from the lymphatic system.* It is associated with Turners syndrome* Most cystic hygromas involve the lymphatic jugular sacs* MC site: Posterior neck region* Other common sites: Axilla, mediastinum, inguinal and retroperitoneal regions* Approximately 50% of them are present at birth.* It may show spontaneous regression* The cysts are filled with clear lymph and lined by a single layer of endothelium epithelium. Clinical Features* Usually manifests in the neonates or in early infancy (50% present at birth).* Prone to infection and hemorrhage within the mass.* Usually present as soft masses that distort the surrounding anatomy, can result in acute airway obstruction.* Swelling is soft and partially compressible and invariably increases in size when the child coughs or cries.* Characteristic features: Brilliantly translucent. Diagnosis: MRI plays a crucial role in preoperative planning. Treatment: Complete surgical excision is the preferred treatment. Also Know* Usually manifests in the neonates or in early infancy presents in 5th decade with firm, rubbery, mobile mass.* Branchial cyst most commonly seen in older children or adolescents.

CN XI, SCM and IJV. MRND has been found to be equally effective in controlling neck disease as RND with superior functional outcome. o Selective neck dissection - Preservation of any of the levels I through V during neck dissection is known as Selective neck dissection - The principle behind preservation of certain nodal groups is that specific primary sites preferentially drain their lymphatics in a predictable pattern. Types of SND include the supraomohyoid neck dissection, the lateral neck dissection, and the posterolateral neck dissection.",

Most common sites for unknown primary:* Nasal Pharynx.* Pyriform Sinus.* Tongue Base* Tonsillar Crypts.* Thyroid* Lung. DRAINAGE Sites for Cervical Lymph Nodes. The left supraclavicular node is called Virchow's node since it is on the left side of the neck where the lymphatic drainage of most of the body (from the thoracic duct) enters the venous circulation via the left subclavian vein. The metastasis blocks the thoracic duct leading to regurgitation into the surrounding nodes i. e. virchow's node. Remember.
