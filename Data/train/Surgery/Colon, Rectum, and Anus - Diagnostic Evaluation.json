        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Abdominal X-ray o It is a case of toxic megacolon. o Toxic megacolon is defined as a transverse colon with a diameter of more than 5. 0 to 6. 0 cm with loss of haustration. Although usually associated with ulcerative colitis, toxic megacolon can also be seen in Crohn's disease. Diagnosiso Plain abdominal radiographs are essential for the diagnosis and management of toxic megacolon (toxic colitis), or TM (TC). Repeated abdominal plain films are necessary to evaluate the efficacy and progress of treatment. o Radiographic findings include the following: o Dilated (>6 cm) transverse colono Presence of intraluminal soft-tissue masses (ie, pseudopolyps)o Free intraperitoneal air - Possible finding, best seen on upright chest radiograph or left lateral decubitus abdominal filmo Segmental parietal thinning is pathognomic for toxic megacolon# Most dangerous complication of toxic megacolon is Perforation.# Precipitating factors for toxic megacolon1) Opioid use2) Anticholinergic use3) Hypokalemia4) Barium enemas# T/T of Toxic megacolon: About 50% of acute dilatations will resolve with medical therapy alone, but urgent colectomy is required for those that do not improve.# Note: Toxic dilatation can also be rarely seen ino Crohn's diseaseo Amoebic colitiso Salmonellosis",

Absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric (Auerbach) and submucosal (Meissner) plexus1 in 5000 live births. M: F 4: 1. Neurogenic parasympathetic abnormality. Muscular spasm of distal colon and internal anal sphincter - functional obstruction - abnormal bowel is contracted distal segment and the normal bowel is the proximal dilated portion. Aganglionosis begins at anorectal line. Rectosigmoid - 80%; splenic or transverse colon 17%; entire colon 8%Transition zone: Area between dilated and contracted segments - ganglion cells begin to appear, in reduced numbers3-5%' have Down syndrome. Risk for HD is greater with family history. Abnormal locus on the chromosome 10 identified; associated w ith the RET oncogene>90% present with progressive abdominal distention, bilious vomiting and failure to pass meconium w ithin first 24 hours of life. Diarrhea may develop due toenterocolitis. Enterocolitis i. s the most common cause of death in patients with uncorrected HD - Diarrhea alternating with obstipation, abdominal distention, fever, hematochezia. and peritonitis. Diagnosis: Initial diagnostic step in a newborn: distal bowel obstruction is a barium enema. Normal barium enema: Rectum is wider than sigmoid colon. HD; spasm of distal rectum - smaller caliber compared to proximal sigmoid. Identification of transition zone may be helpful in diagnosis of HDFailure to evacuate instilled contrast completely after 24 hours. Exclude other causes of constipation in the newborn - meconium plug and small left colon syndrome, atresia. Manometry: Failure of the internal sphincter to relax when the rectum is distended with a balloon. Rectal biopsy: gold standard- Newborn period - Bedside with special suction rectal biopsy instrument- Obtain biopsy specimen from at least 2 cm above the dentate line to avoid sampling the normal transition from ganglionated bowel to paucity or absence of ganglia in the region of the internal sphincter- Older children: full-thickness biopsy under general anesthesia (thicker rectal mucosa is not amenable to suction biopsy)- Features: deg Absent gangliadeg Hypertrophied nerve trunksdeg Robust immunostaining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE)deg Loss of calretininimmunostaining- superiorto ACh. Ein evaluation of suction rectal biopsies. Surgical Management. Traditionally: Leveling colostomy, confirmation of transition zone by frozen section evaluation of multiple seromuscular biopsies. Diverting colostomy (end or loop) in the region of normal ganglionated bowel. Definitive surgical options: Swenson procedure; Aganglionic bowel removed down to the level of the internal sphincters: coloanal anastomosis. Duhamel procedure: Aganglionic rectal stump left in place and ganglionated normal colon is pulled behind the stump. Soave technique: Endorectal mucosal dissection within aganglionic distal rectum; Normally ganglionated colon then pulled through the remnant muscular cuff; coloanal anastomosis. Nowadays* performed in newborn period as a primary procedure without an initial colostomy. Constipation is the most frequent postoperative problem: others - soiling, incontinence, and entprocolitis",
