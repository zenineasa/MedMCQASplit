Rx of RECTAL PROPLASE:# An abdominal rectopexy has a lower rate of recurrence but, when the patient is elderly and very frail, a perineal operation is indicated. As an abdominal procedure risks damage to the pelvic autonomic nerves, resulting in possible sexual dysfunction, a perineal approach is also usually preferred in young men. A. Perineal approach -These procedures have been used most commonly.# Thiersch operation- This procedure, which aimed to place a steel wire or, more commonly, a silastic or nylon suture around the anal canal, has become obsolete as the suture would often break or cause chronic perineal sepsis, or both, or the anal stenosis so created would produce severe functional problems. Delorme's operation is now the preferred perineal operation.# Delorme's operation- In this procedure, the rectal mucosa is removed circumferentially from the prolapsed rectum over its length. The underlying muscle is then plicated with a series of sutures, such that, when these are tied, the rectal muscle is concertinaed towards the anal canal. The anal canal mucosa is then sutured circumferentially to the rectal mucosa remaining at the tip of the prolapse. The prolapse is reduced, and a ring of muscle is created above the anal canal, which prevents recurrence.# Altemeier's procedure- This consists of excision of the prolapsed rectum and associated sigmoid colon from below, and construction of a coloanal anastomosis. B. Abdominal approach# The principle of all abdominal operations for rectal prolapse is to replace and hold the rectum in its proper position. They are recommended in patients with complete prolapse who are otherwise in good health.# Many variations have been described: in Wells' operation, the rectum is fixed firmly to the sacrum by inserting a sheet of polypropylene mesh between them; Ripstein's operation involves hitching up the rectosigmoid junction by a Teflon sling to the front of the sacrum; many surgeons simply suture the mobilised rectum to the sacrum using four to six interrupted non-absorbable sutures - so called sutured rectopexy.
