It occurs due to damage of Auriculotemporal nerve during parotid gland dissection). It manifest after 2-3 months of the parotid surgery. Clinical PearlsA formal superficial parotidectomy (or superficial and deep if the tumor is deep to the facial nerve) is the appropriate way to excise--and thereby biopsy--parotid tumors, preventing recurrences and sparing the facial nerve. In malignant tumors the nerve is sacrificed and a nerve interposition graft performed. Open biopsy is absolutely contraindicated but FNA of these tumors may be done.",
