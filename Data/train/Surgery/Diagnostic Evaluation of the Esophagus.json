        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e. Metaplasia Normally esophagus has squamous epithelium*. Presence of another type of epithelium i. e. (columnar) in esophagus indicates metaplasia. Metaplasiais an abnormality of cellular differentiation in which one type of mature cell is replaced by a different type of mature cell, (and the latter is not normal for the tissue involved). Other questions on metaplasia; -Metaplasia is reversible*Metaplasia most commonly involves epithelium. Metaplastic tissue is structurally normal and itself carries no increased risk of development of cancer. Dysplasiais abnormality of both differentiation and maturation.* It is characterized by: -Nuclear abnormalitiesincreased nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio*hyperchromatism*abnormal chromatin distribution (chromatin clumping). Cellular pleomorphism *(variation in size and shape of cells). Mitotic figures are seen in many layers of the epithelium in contrast to the normal state, in which mitosis in limited to the basal layer. Dysplasia is reversible*Carcinoma in situ -When the dysplastic changes involve the entire thickness of the epithelium, it is referred to as carcinoma in situ. Hyperplasiais an increase in the size of a tissue as a result of increased number of component cells. eg. breast hyperplasia in pregnancy and lactation*. Prostate hyperplasia in older men. Thyroid hyperplasia in Graves' disease. The following flow chart may be very useful in understanding various abnormalities of cell growth and differentiation. Abnormal differentiation. Replacement of mature cells of one type with cells of another type. Regular organization of tissue maintained. Reversible. Abnormal differentiation and maturation. Partial loss of control and organization. Slight increase in cell number. Cytologic abnormalities. Partially reversible. Abnormal differentiation and maturation. Marked increase in cell number. Complete loss of control. Variable loss of organization. Cytologic abnormalities. Irreversible",

        "question": "Best test to diagnose gastroesophageal reflux disease and quantify acid output:",
        "exp": "Ans. d. 24 hours pH monitoring Best test to diagnose gastroesophageal reflux disease and quantify acid output is 24 hours pH monitoring. Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)* Classical triad of symptoms is retrosternal burning pain, epigastric pain and regurgitation0.* GERD is associated with complications such as esophageal ulcerations (5%), peptic strictures (4-20%), and Barrett's esophagus (8-20%). Pathophysiology: LES has the primary role of preventing reflux into the esophagus. Factors contributing to the high-pressure zone in the lower esophagus* Intrinsic musculature0 of the distal esophagus which are in a state of tonic contraction* Sling fibers of the cardiadeg which are at the same anatomic depth of the circular muscle fibers of the esophagus but are oriented in a different direction* Diaphragm: during inspiration the anteroposterior diameter of the crural opening is decreased, compressing the esophagus and increasing the measured pressure at the LES* Transmitted pressure0 of the abdominal cavity. Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)* GERD is often associated with a hiatal hernia (MC type is type I or sliding hernia)* A hiatal hernia is neither necessary nor sufficient to make the diagnosis of GERD, and the presence of such a hernia does not constitute an indication for operative correction*3.* Many patients with hiatal hernias do not have symptoms and do not require treatment. Clinical Features:* Classical triad of symptoms is retrosternal burning pain, epigastric pain and regurgitation.* MC presentation of GERD: Long-standing history of heartburn and a shorter history of regurgitation* Symptoms of GERD: Heartburn (80%)*\\ Regurgitation (54%), Abdominal pain (29%), Cough (27%), Dysphagia for solids (23%), Belching (15%), Bloating (15%), Aspiration (14%), Wheezing (7%). Diagnosis:* Endoscopy: Exclude other diseases, especially a tumor, and to document the presence of peptic esophageal injury. An essential step in the evaluation of GERD. who are being considered for operative intervention0.* Manometry: For information about the function of the esophageal body and LESdeg24-hour pH Monitoring* Gold standard for diagnosing and quantify ing acid reflux is the 24-hour pH test.* Information from the study: Total number of reflux episodes (pH<4), longest episode of reflux, number of episodes lasting >5 minutes, extent of reflux in the upright and supine position.* De. Meester score: An overall score is obtained with the use of a formula that assigns a weight to each item according to its capacity to cause esophageal injury.* De. Meester score needs to be <14. 7deg.* Esophagograin: For evaluation of symptoms of GERD when an operation is contemplated or when the symptoms do not respond as expected. Presence and size of a hiatal hernia may be characterized. Treatment: Lifestyle modifications: Cessation of smoking, decreased caffeine intake, and avoidance of large meals before lying down*3. Medical Management: Double dose of PPI is the initial approach* Compared with H, blockers, PPIs are more effective at healing esophageal ulceration secondary' to acid exposure. Indications of Surgical Therapy* Severe esophageal injury (ulcer, stricture, or Barrett's mucosa)* Incomplete resolution of symptoms or relapses while on medical therapy* Long duration of symptoms* Symptoms persist at a young age",

Ref: Bailey and Lovefs Short Practice of Surgery, 26th edition, pg: 117 and Waltzman ML, Management of Esophageal Coins. Curr Opin Pediatr 2006 Oct; 18{5}: 571-74. Explanation:\"Objects found within the esophagus should generally be considered impacted So immediate endoscopic removal is necessary. '\"Ref: Bailey. In the symptomatic patient with an esophageal coin, immediate removal via endoscopy is recommended. For the asymptomatic patient with an esophageal coin, current data support expectant management for a period of 12-24 hours with the hope of spontaneous passage and avoidance of general anesthesia and surgical procedure. \" Ref: Curr Opin Pediatr. Since the child in the given scenario is asymptomatic, Option A is a better answer than B. Esophageal FB in Children. Objects found within the esophagus should generally be considered impacted. So immediate endoscopic removal is necessary. Esophageal impaction of paediatric foreign body are usually seen at 1 of 3 typical locations. 1 Cricopharyngeus muscle constriction at 15 cm. Bronchoaortic constriction at 25 cm. Diaphragmatic constriction at 40 cm. The most common site of esophageal impaction is at the Cricopharyngeal constriction (thoracic inlet). About 70% of blunt foreign bodies that lodge in the esophagus are seen at the thoracic inlet. Narrowest part of GIT is cricopharyngeus sphincter. FB lodged at that part wont progress downwards. Impacted button batteries are notorious for rapidly causing local necrosis and should be removed from the esophagus without delay. Blunt foreign bodies located at the Lower Esophageal Sphincter often spontaneously pass within several hours of ingestion. Coins lodged in the upper esophagus can be removed using Magills forceps. Remember. In symptomatic children or in case of Button battery ingestion - Immediate endoscopic removal. In asymptomatic children - Wait for 24 hours - If not passed into stomach - Immediate endoscopic removal.",
