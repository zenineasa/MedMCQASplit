Barret's esophagus is metaplastic change of distal esophageal mucosa from normal squamous epithelium to columnar epithelium, in response to chronic gastro-esophageal reflux. The junction between squamous esophageal mucosa and gastric mucosa moves proximally. The risk of adenocarcinoma increases with increasing length of columnar-lined epithelium. The adenocarcinoma develops at the squamo-columnar junction (85%) or within 2 cm of the junction. Other complications of Barett's esophagus include: peptic ulcers in the columnar lined seg. of esopahgushigh and long strictures occur at the squamo-columnar junction and move high up as the squamo- columnar junction moves up with progressive injury.",

Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations account for essentially all reflux events in individuals with a normal LES pressure at the time of reflux Pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The primary event in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is movement of gastric juice from the stomach into the esophagus. The three dominant pathophysiologic mechanisms causing gastroesophageal junction incompetence are: Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (t. LESRs)A hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Anatomic disruption of the gastroesophageal junction, often associated with a hiatal hernia. The latest concept is that the dominant mechanism varies as a function of disease severity with t. LESRs predominating with mild disease and mechanisms associated with a hiatus hernia and/or a weak sphincter predominating with more severe disease Transient LES relaxations are different from swallow-induced LES relaxation: t. LESRs occur without an associated pharyngeal contraction, are unaccompanied by esophageal peristalsis, and persist for longer periods (>10 sec) than do swallow-induced LES relaxations. t. LESRs are the physiological mechanism of belching.",

        "exp": "Ans: B (Zenker's diverticulum) Ref: Sethis ton Textbook of Surgery, 19th Edition 1023-4. Explanation: Pharyngoesophageal (Zenker's) Diverticulum. Protrusion of mucosa and submucosa posteriorly above the cricopharyngeal sphincter through the natural weak point (the dehiscence of Killian ) between the oblique and horizontal (cricopharyngeus) fibres of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor. Most common esophageal diverticulum. Also known as cricopharyngeal achalasia. Usually presents in the seventh decade of life. Due to loss of tissue elasticity and muscle tone with age. Clinical Features. Often initially asymptomatic. Sticking sensation in the throat. A nagging cough, excessive salivation, and intermittent dysphagia often are signs of progressive disease. As the sac increases in size, regurgitation of foulsmelling, undigested material occurs. Halitosis, voice changes, retrosternal pain, and respiratory infections - common in older adults. The most serious complication - aspiration pneumonia or lung abscess. Diagnosis. Investigation of choice - Barium esophagraphy. At the level of the cricothyroid cartilage, the diverticulum can be seen filled with barium resting posteriorly alongside the esophagus. Lateral views are must because this is usually a posterior structure. Neither esophageal manometry nor endoscopy is needed for diagnosis. Management. Surgical or endoscopic repair of a Zenker's diverticulum is the gold standard of treatment. Traditionally, an open repair through the left neck was advocated. Endoscopic exclusion has gained popularity. Depends on the size of the diverticulum. Small diverticulum (<2 cm), a myotomy of the proximal and distal thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus alone is done. 5 cm - Diverticulectomy is the treatment of choice In frail patients who may be subject to a higher rate of cervical esophageal leak, a diverticulopexy, without resection, is performed- Between 2 and 5 em- Endoscopic Dohlman procedure. Endoscopic division of the common wall between the esophagus and diverticulum using a laser or stapler.",
