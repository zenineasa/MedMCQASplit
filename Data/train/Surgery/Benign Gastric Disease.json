The vomiting is nonbilious and progresses to projectile vomiting, jaundice occurs in about 10% of cases. An olive-shaped mass may be palpated in the epigastric area in these patients.

One of the most common G1 surgical disorders in early infancy. Most common between the ages of 2 and 8 weeks. Boys are affected four times as often as girls, First-born male infants being at highest risk. Hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the pylorus results in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet, leading to nonbilious & projectile emesis. Emesis leads to Loss of hydrochloric acid with the onset of hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, and dehydration. Exact cause for HPS remains unknown, a lack of nitric oxide synthase in pyloric tissue has been implicated. Clinical Presentation. Progressively worsening nonbilious emesis. With time, the emesis becomes more frequent, forceful, and projectile in nature. Occasionally, visible gastric peristalsis may be observed as a wave of contractions from the left upper quadrant to the epigastrium. Shortly after emesis, infants usually crave additional feedings. Palpation of the pyloric tumor (olive-shaped) in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant by an experienced examiner is pathognomonic for the diagnosis. If the olive is palpated, no additional diagnostic testing is necessary. Investigations. Abdominal Radiograph: Upper abdominal gas bubble in the stomach.

With equivocal clinical history, an upper Gl contrast study is useful to evaluate for other causes of vomiting. Treatment: Surgical Management. The treatment of HPS is pyloromyotomy (Ramstedt procedure). Incising through thickened pyloric musculature while preserving the underlying mucosa. Right upper quadrant or periumbilical incision is used. Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy has better cosmesis. with similar outcomes to those of the open technique. Perioperative management: Before surgery, it is important that the infant be fully rehydrated with IV fluids to establish an adequate urine output and correct electrolyte disturbances such as metabolic alkalosis.

The condition is most commonly seen at 4 wks. after birth ranging from the 3rd wk. to on rare occasion, the 7th. However, 20% of infants are symptomatic from birth, and most are symptomatic within the first 2 months after birth. Non-bilious vomiting, becoming increasingly projectile, occurs over several days to weeks. Eventually the infant will develop a nearly complete obstruction by the second to fourth week of life and will not be able to hold down even clear liquids. This invariably proceeds to severe dehydration if not t/t.

Explanation: The vomiting of hydrochloric acid results in hypochloraemic alkalosis but, initially, sodium and potassium levels may be relatively normal. As dehydration progresses, more profound metabolic abnormalities arise, partly related to renal dysfunction. Initially, the urine has a low chloride and high bicarbonate content, reflecting the primary metabolic abnormality. This bicarbonate is excreted along with sodium and so, with time, the patient becomes progressively hyponatraemic and more profoundly dehydrated. Because of the dehydration, a phase of sodium retention follows and potassium and hydrogen are excreted in preference. This results in the urine becoming paradoxically acidic and hypokalaemia ensues.
