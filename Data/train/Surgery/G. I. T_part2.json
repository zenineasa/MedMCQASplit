Incidence Insulinomas are the most frequent of all the functioning PETs with a repoed incidence of 2-4 cases per million population per year. Insulinomas have been diagnosed in all age groups, with the highest incidence found in the fouh to the sixth decades. Women seem to be slightly more frequently affected. Pathology The aetiology and pathogenesis of insulinomas are unknown. No risk factors have been associated with these tumours. Viually all insulinomas are located in the pancreas and tumours are equally distributed within the gland. Approximately 90% are solitary and about 10% are multiple and associated with MEN 1 syndrome. Prognosis and predictive factors No markers are available that reliably predict the biological behaviour of an insulinoma. Approximately 10% are malignant. Insulinomas of <2 cm in diameter without signs of vascular invasion or metastases are considered benign. Clinical features Insulinomas are characterised by fasting hypoglycaemia and neuroglycopenic symptoms. The episodic nature of the hypoglycaemic attacks is caused by intermittent insulin secretion by the tumour. This leads to central nervous system symptoms such as diplopia, blurred vision, confusion, abnormal behaviour and amnesia. Some patients develop loss of consciousness and coma. The release of catecholamines produces symptoms such as sweating, weakness, hunger, tremor, nausea, anxiety and palpitations. Biochemical diagnosis A fasting test that may last for up to 72 hours is regarded as the most sensitive test. Usually, insulin, proinsulin, C- peptide and blood glucose are measured in 1- to 2-hour intervals to demonstrate inappropriately high secretion of insulin in relation to blood glucose. About 80% of insulinomas are diagnosed by this test, most of them in the first 24 hours. Elevated C-peptide levels demonstrate the endogenous secretion of insulin and exclude factitious hypoglycaemia caused by insulin injection. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 849",

This procedure excises a strip of mucosa and submucosa (together with the vessels travelling within them) circumferentially, well above the dentate line. Activation of the gun also simultaneously repairs the cut mucosa and submucosa by stapling the edges together. This procedure is quick to perform, and controlled trials suggest that it is less painful and less traumatic than conventional haemorrhoidectomy and, at least in the sho term, it seems to be equally efficacious. However, evidence is emerging that the technique is associated with higher recurrence rates than following conventional haemorrhoidectomy, and associated with more additional surgery. The patient, after counselling, may or may not choose to accept a higher recurrence rate to take advantage of the sho-term benefits. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 1359",

        "question": "Most common complication of pseudocyst of pancreas",
        "exp": "PSEUDOCYST A pseudocyst is a collection of amylase-rich fluid enclosed in a well-defined wall of fibrous or granulation tissue. Pseudocysts typically arise following an attack of mild acute pancreatitis, lie outside the pancreas, and represent an APFC that has not resolved and matured. Formation of a pseudocyst requires 4 weeks or more from the onset of acute pancreatitis. The Term 'pseudocyst' is often used more loosely, to include sterile WON that has failed to resolve, or a collection that has developed in the context of chronic pancreatitis or after pancreatic trauma. If carefully investigated, more than half of these will be found to have a communication with the main pancreatic duct. Pseudocysts are often single but, occasionally, patients will develop multiple pseudocysts. A pseudocyst is usually identified on ultrasound or a CT scan. It is impoant to differentiate a pseudocyst from an APFC; the clinical scenario and the radiological appearances should allow that distinction to be made. Occasionally, a cystic neoplasm may be confused with a chronic pseudocyst. EUS and aspiration of the cyst fluid is very useful in such a situation. The fluid should be sent for measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, amylase levels and cytology. Fluid from a pseudocyst typically has a low CEA level, and levels above 400 ng/mL are suggestive of a mucinous neoplasm. Pseudocyst fluid usually has a high amylase level, but that is not diagnostic, as a tumour that communicates with the duct system may yield similar findings. Cytology typically reveals inflammatory cells in pseudocyst fluid. If there is no access to EUS, then percutaneous FNA is acceptable (just aspiration, not percutaneous inseion of a drain). ERCP and MRCP may demonstrate communication of the cyst with the pancreatic duct system, demonstrate ductal anomalies, or diagnose chronic pancreatitis and thus help in planning treatment. Pseudocysts will resolve spontaneously in most instances, but complications can develop. Pseudocysts that are thick-walled or large (over 6 cm in diameter), have lasted for a long time (over 12 weeks), or have arisen in the context of chronic pancreatitis are less likely to resolve spontaneously, but these factors are not specific indications for intervention. Therapeutic interventions are advised only if the pseudocyst causes symptoms, if complications develop, or if a distinction has to be made between a pseudocyst and a tumour. There are three possible approaches to draining a pseudocyst: percutaneous, endoscopic and surgical. Percutaneous drainage to the exterior under radiological guidance should be avoided. It carries a very high likelihood of recurrence. More over, it is not advisable unless one is absolutely ceain that the cyst is not neoplastic and that it has no communication with the pancreatic duct (or else a pancreaticocutaneous fistula will develop). A percutaneous transgastric cystgastrostomy can be done under imaging guidance, and a double-pigtail drain placed with one end in the cyst cavity and the other end in the gastric lumen. This requires specialist expeise but, in experienced hands, the recurrence rates are no more than 15%. Endoscopic drainage usually involves puncture of the cyst through the stomach or duodenal wall under EUS guidance, and placement of a tube drain with one end in the cyst cavity and the other end in the gastric lumen. The success rates depend on operator expeise. Occasionally, ERCP and placement of a pancreatic stent across the ampulla may help to drain a pseudocyst that is in communication with the duct. Surgical drainage involves internally draining the cyst into the gastric or jejunal lumen. Recurrence rates should be no more than 5%, and this still remains the standard against which the evolving radiological and endoscopic approaches are measured. The approach is conventionally through an open incision, but laparoscopic cystgastrostomy is also feasible. Pseudocysts that have developed complications are best managed surgically. There is a small group of patients who, having suffered an attack of necrotising pancreatitis with duct disruption, go on to suffer repeated complications in the form of recurrent fluid collections, pseudocysts, pleural effusions or pancreatic ascites. Very often disruption of the main pancreatic duct in the neck, body or tail is compounded by a stricture or a stone in the head that cannot be treated endoscopically. In such patients, some form of surgical resection and/or a drainage procedure even though it may be technically challenging may be the only way to achieve lasting resolution.

It is a cause of persistent peptic ulceration. Before the development of potent gastric antisecretory agents, the condition was recognised by the sometimes fulminant peptic ulceration which did not respond to gastric surgery sho of total gastrectomy. It was also recognisable from gastric secretory studies in which the patient had a very high basal acid output but no marked response to pentagastrin, as the parietal cell mass was already nearly maximally stimulated by pathological levels of gastrin. The advent of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole has rendered this extreme endocrine condition fully controllable, but also less easily recognised. Gastrinomas may be either sporadic or associated with the autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type I (in which a parathyroid adenoma is almost invariable). The tumours are most commonly found in the 'gastrinoma triangle' (Passaro) defined by the junction of the cystic duct and common bile duct superiorly, the junction of the second and third pas of the duodenum inferiorly, and the junction of the neck and body of the pancreas medially (essentially the superior mesenteric aery). Many are found in the duodenal loop, presumably arising in the G cells found in Brunner's glands. It is extremely impoant that the duodenal wall is very carefully inspected endoscopically and also at operation. Very often all that can be detected is a small nodule that projects into the medial wall of the duodenum. Even malignant sporadic gastrinomas may have a very indolent course. The palliative resection of liver metastases may be beneficial and liver transplantation is practised in some centres, as for other gut endocrine tumours, with reasonable long-term results. However, the minority of tumours found to the left of the superior mesenteric aery (outside the 'triangle') seem to have a worse prognosis, more having liver metastases at presentation. In MEN type I, the tumours may be multiple and the condition is incurable. Even in this situation, as with sporadic gastrinoma, surgical treatment should be employed to remove any obvious tumours and associated lymphatic metastases, as the palliation achieved may be good.

Therefore, an increase in the rate of synthesis occurs following ileal resection. Ileal resection decreases the ability to absorb bile acids from the small intestine and causes a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of the bile acids. Therefore, secretion of new bile acids is increased. Injection of cholecystokinin or stimulation of the vagus nerve contract the gallbladder and relax the sphincter of Oddi, causing increased delivery of bile acids to the duodenum. These bile acids are absorbed in the ileum and returned to the liver in the hepatic poal blood. Therefore, synthesis of new bile acids is decreased. Lovastatin, which decreases the activity of 3 hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, decreases synthesis of cholesterol and, therefore, decreases the synthesis of bile acids.

        "question": "Most common tumour of pancreas is",
        "exp": "Pathology of carcinoma pancreas More than 85% of pancreatic cancers are ductal adenocarcinomas. The remaining tumours constitute a variety of pathologies with individual characteristics. Endocrine tumours of the pancreas are rare. Ductal adenocarcinomas arise most commonly in the head of the gland. They are solid, scirrhous tumours, characterised by neoplastic tubular glands within a markedly desmoplastic fibrous stroma. Fibrosis is also a characteristic of chronic pancreatitis, and histological differentiation between tumour and pancreatitis can cause diagnostic difficulties. Ductal adenocarcinomas infiltrate locally, typically along nerve sheaths, along lymphatics and into blood vessels. Liver and peritoneal metastases are common. Proliferative lesions in the pancreatic ducts can precede invasive ductal adenocarcinoma. These are termed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia or Pan. IN, and can demonstrate a range of structural complexity and cellular atypia. Cystic tumours of the pancreas may be serous or mucinous. Serous cystadenomas are typically found in older women, and are large aggregations of multiple small cysts, almost like bubblewrap. They are benign. Mucinous tumours, on the other hand, have the potential for malignant transformation. They include mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). MCNs are seen in perimenopausal women, show up as multilocular thick-walled cysts in the pancreatic body or tail, and, histologically, contain an ovarian-type stroma. IPMNs are more common in the pancreatic head and in older men, but an IPMN arising from a branch duct can be difficult to distinguish from an MCN. IPMNs arising within the main duct are often multifocal and have a greater tendency to prove malignant. Thick mucus seen extruding from the ampulla at ERCP is diagnostic of a main duct IPMN. Mucinous tumours can be confused with pseudocysts. Occasionally, lympho epithelial cysts, lymphangiomas, dermoid cysts and intestinal duplication cysts can show up in the pancreas. Solid pseudopapillary tumour is a rare, slowly progressive but malignant tumour, seen in women of childbearing age, and manifests as a large, pa-solid, pa-cystic tumour. Tumours arising from the ampulla or from the distal common bile duct can present as a mass in the head of the pancreas, and constitute around a third of all tumours in that area. Adenomas of the ampulla of Vater are diagnosed at endoscopy as polypoid submucosal masses covered by a smooth epithelium. They can harbour foci of invasive carcinoma; the larger the adenoma, the greater the risk. Biopsies taken at endoscopy may not always include the malignant focus. Endoscopic surveillance, endoscopic resection or even surgical transduodenal ampullary excision should be considered. Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) can present with multiple duodenal polyps. Malignant transformation in a duodenal polyp is a significant cause of moality in these patients, mandating endoscopic follow-up and pancreatoduodenectomy in selected patients with high- grade dysplasia within the polyp. Ampullary adenocarcinomas often present early with biliary obstruction. Their natural history is distinctly more ourable compared with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Ampullary carcinomas are relatively small when diagnosed, which may account for their better prognosis. Occasionally, other malignant neoplasms can arise at the ampulla, such as carcinoid tumours and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 1234",

Over 80% of cases come from patients with a positive family history. The remainder arise as a result of new mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene on the sho arm of chromosome 5. FAP is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition and is consequently equally likely in men and women. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 100% in patients with FAP. FAP can also be associated with benign mesodermal tumours such as desmoid tumours and osteomas. Epidermoid cysts can also occur (Gardner's syndrome); desmoid tumours in the abdomen spread locally to involve the intestinal mesentery and, although non-metastasising, they may become unresectable. Up to 50% of patients with FAP have congenital hyperophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), which can be used to screen affected families if genetic testing is unavailable. CLINICAL FEATURES Polyps are usually visible on sigmoidoscopy by the age of 15 years and will almost always be visible by the age of 30 years. Carcinoma of the large bowel develops 10-20 years after the onset of the polyposis. If there are no adenomas by the age of 30 years, FAP is unlikely. If the diagnosis is made duringadolescence, surgery is usually deferred to the age of 17 or 18 years unless symptoms develop. Malignant change is rare before the age of 20 years. Examination of blood relatives, including cousins, nephews and nieces, is essential; a family tree should be constructed and a register of affected families maintained. Referral to a medical geneticist is essential. If over 100 adenomas are present at colonoscopy, the diagnosis can be made confidently Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 1259",

A tumor that is 2 cm or smaller is designated T1, larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm is T2, and larger than 5 cm is T3. Any size tumor that invades a local structure is designated T4. Staging of disease includes CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and pelvic MRI. Positron emission tomography scanning should be considered for larger (T2 or greater) tumors or any node-positive disease. HIV testing and checking a CD4 count should also be considered if indicated. Historically, treatment consisted of surgery alone or radiation therapy alone. Epithelial or subepithelial tumors were locally excised, and more advanced lesions underwent APR. The introduction of multimodality therapy combining chemotherapy andradiation therapy promised to preserve continence, to avoid colostomy, and to offer similar or improved survival. Nigro was the first to promote radiation therapy with chemotherapy as definitive treatment for squamous cell cancers of the anal canal. The current protocol includes infusional 5-FU with mitomycin C and external beam radiation to the pelvis with a minimum dose of 45. Gy. The inguinal nodes, pelvis, anus, and perineum should be included in the radiation fields. Patients with T2 lesions and residual disease after 45 Gy, T3 or T4 tumors, or node-positive disease are usually treated with an additional 9 to 14 Gy for a total dose of 54 to 59 Gy. In patients treated with APR for persistent or locally recurrent disease, 5-year actuarial survival is repoed at 57%. 46 Despite high success rates with definitive chemoradiotherapy, 15% to 30% of patients will have recurrence or fail to respondcompletely. 47 Patients with persistent disease up to 6 months after treatment generally require APR. Those who have local recurrence are also recommended for APR. In the setting of isolated inguinal node recurrence, groin dissection is generally required with consideration for radiation therapy to the inguinal node basins if no prior radiotherapy was given. Up to 50% of patients treated with salvage APR can expect a 5-year cure. This is compared with approximately 27% of patients treated with salvage radiation and concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy who can expect cure. In those patients presenting with anal squamous cell carcinoma in the setting of HIV infection, disease severity (CD4 count and use of antiretroviral therapy) has a significant impact on success of standard chemoradiation. The current consensus is that standard protocols for chemoradiotherapy should be attempted, regardless of HIV status, and that medical management of the patient's HIV infection be optimized. The 2-year survival rates for HIV-positive patients have been repoed to be the same as for HIV-negative patients, 77% and 75%, respectively Ref: Sabiston 20th edition Pg no: 1415",

        "question": "Most common cause of Pseudocyst of pancreas is",
        "exp": "PSEUDOCYST A pseudocyst is a collection of amylase-rich fluid enclosed in a well-defined wall of fibrous or granulation tissue. Pseudocysts typically arise following an attack of mild acute pancreatitis, lie outside the pancreas, and represent an APFC that has not resolved and matured. Formation of a pseudocyst requires 4 weeks or more from the onset of acute pancreatitis. The Term 'pseudocyst' is often used more loosely, to include sterile WON that has failed to resolve, or a collection that has developed in the context of chronic pancreatitis or after pancreatic trauma. If carefully investigated, more than half of these will be found to have a communication with the main pancreatic duct. Pseudocysts are often single but, occasionally, patients will develop multiple pseudocysts. A pseudocyst is usually identified on ultrasound or a CT scan. It is impoant to differentiate a pseudocyst from an APFC; the clinical scenario and the radiological appearances should allow that distinction to be made. Occasionally, a cystic neoplasm may be confused with a chronic pseudocyst. EUS and aspiration of the cyst fluid is very useful in such a situation. The fluid should be sent for measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, amylase levels and cytology. Fluid from a pseudocyst typically has a low CEA level, and levels above 400 ng/mL are suggestive of a mucinous neoplasm. Pseudocyst fluid usually has a high amylase level, but that is not diagnostic, as a tumour that communicates with the duct system may yield similar findings. Cytology typically reveals inflammatory cells in pseudocyst fluid. If there is no access to EUS, then percutaneous FNA is acceptable (just aspiration, not percutaneous inseion of a drain). ERCP and MRCP may demonstrate communication of the cyst with the pancreatic duct system, demonstrate ductal anomalies, or diagnose chronic pancreatitis and thus help in planning treatment. Pseudocysts will resolve spontaneously in most instances, but complications can develop. Pseudocysts that are thick-walled or large (over 6 cm in diameter), have lasted for a long time (over 12 weeks), or have arisen in the context of chronic pancreatitis are less likely to resolve spontaneously, but these factors are not specific indications for intervention. Therapeutic interventions are advised only if the pseudocyst causes symptoms, if complications develop, or if a distinction has to be made between a pseudocyst and a tumour. There are three possible approaches to draining a pseudocyst: percutaneous, endoscopic and surgical. Percutaneous drainage to the exterior under radiological guidance should be avoided. It carries a very high likelihood of recurrence. More over, it is not advisable unless one is absolutely ceain that the cyst is not neoplastic and that it has no communication with the pancreatic duct (or else a pancreaticocutaneous fistula will develop). A percutaneous transgastric cystgastrostomy can be done under imaging guidance, and a double-pigtail drain placed with one end in the cyst cavity and the other end in the gastric lumen. This requires specialist expeise but, in experienced hands, the recurrence rates are no more than 15%. Endoscopic drainage usually involves puncture of the cyst through the stomach or duodenal wall under EUS guidance, and placement of a tube drain with one end in the cyst cavity and the other end in the gastric lumen. The success rates depend on operator expeise. Occasionally, ERCP and placement of a pancreatic stent across the ampulla may help to drain a pseudocyst that is in communication with the duct. Surgical drainage involves internally draining the cyst into the gastric or jejunal lumen. Recurrence rates should be no more than 5%, and this still remains the standard against which the evolving radiological and endoscopic approaches are measured. The approach is conventionally through an open incision, but laparoscopic cystgastrostomy is also feasible. Pseudocysts that have developed complications are best managed surgically. There is a small group of patients who, having suffered an attack of necrotising pancreatitis with duct disruption, go on to suffer repeated complications in the form of recurrent fluid collections, pseudocysts, pleural effusions or pancreatic ascites. Very often disruption of the main pancreatic duct in the neck, body or tail is compounded by a stricture or a stone in the head that cannot be treated endoscopically. In such patients, some form of surgical resection and/or a drainage procedure even though it may be technically challenging may be the only way to achieve lasting resolution.

Operative measures Historically, under regional or general anaesthesia, forceful manual (four- or eight-digit) sphincter dilatation was used to reduce sphincter tone; however, this was achieved in an uncontrolled fashion with potential disruption at multiple sites of the internal (and even external) sphincter. The risk of incontinence following this procedure has now made it unpopular, although more conservative controlled stretching is still practised in young men with very high sphincter tone. Fissure healing can also be achieved by a posterior division of the exposed fibres of the internal sphincter in the fissure base, but this is associated with prolonged healing, as well as passive anal leakage thought mainly to be due to the resulting keyhole gutter deformity; however, it may be indicated if there is an associated intersphincteric fistula. Lateral anal sphincterotomy In this operation, the internal sphincter is divided away from the fissure itself - usually either in the right or the left lateral positions (Notaras). The procedure can be carried out using an open or a closed method, under local, regional or general anaesthesia, and with the patient in the lithotomy or prone jack-knife position. The distal internal sphincter is palpated with a bivalved speculum at the intersphincteric groove. In the closed method, a small longitudinal incision is made over this, and the submucosal and intersphincteric planes are carefully developed to allow precise division of the internal sphincter with a knife or scissors to the level of the apex of the fissure; the wound is then closed with absorbable sutures. Alternatively, either plane can be entered using a scalpel, with the blade advanced parallel to the sphincter and then rotated such that the sharp edge faces the internal sphincter, which can then be divided along its distal third. Pressure should be applied to the wound for a few minutes to prevent haematoma formation. In the open technique, the anoderm overlying the distal internal sphincter is divided longitudinally to expose the sphincter, which is divided, and the wound is closed with absorbable sutures. Although the fissure needs no specific attention, problematic papillae and external tags can be excised concomitantly. Early complications of sphincterotomy include haemorrhage, haematoma, bruising, perianal abscess and fistula. Despite low recurrence rates, the most impoant complication is incontinence of a variable nature and severity, which may affect up to 30% of patients, paicularly women, who have weaker, shoer sphincter complexes and in whom there may already have been cove sphincter compromise incurred by childbih.

        "question": "Zollinger Ellison syndrome true about A/E",
        "exp": "Zollinger-Ellison syndrome This syndrome is mentioned here because the gastrin producing endocrine tumour is often found in the duodenal loop, although it also occurs in the pancreas, especially the head. It is a cause of persistent peptic ulceration. Before the development of potent gastric antisecretory agents, the condition was recognised by the sometimes fulminant peptic ulceration which did not respond to gastric surgery sho of total gastrectomy. It was also recognisable from gastric secretory studies in which the patient had a very high basal acid output but no marked response to pentagastrin, as the parietal cell mass was already nearly maximally stimulated by pathological levels of gastrin. The advent of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole has rendered this extreme endocrine condition fully controllable, but also less easily recognised. Gastrinomas may be either sporadic or associated with the autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type I (in which a parathyroid adenoma is almost invariable). The tumours are most commonly found in the 'gastrinoma triangle' (Passaro) defined by the junction of the cystic duct and common bile duct superiorly, the junction of the second and third pas of the duodenum inferiorly, and the junction of the neck and body of the pancreas medially (essentially the superior mesenteric aery). Many are found in the duodenal loop, presumably arising in the G cells found in Brunner's glands. It is extremely impoant that the duodenal wall is very carefully inspected endoscopically and also at operation. Very often all that can be detected is a small nodule that projects into the medial wall of the duodenum. Even malignant sporadic gastrinomas may have a very indolent course. The palliative resection of liver metastases may be beneficial and liver transplantation is practised in some centres, as for other gut endocrine tumours, with reasonable long-term results. However, the minority of tumours found to the left of the superior mesenteric aery (outside the 'triangle') seem to have a worse prognosis, more having liver metastases at presentation. In MEN type I, the tumours may be multiple and the condition is incurable. Even in this situation, as with sporadic gastrinoma, surgical treatment should be employed to remove any obvious tumours and associated lymphatic metastases, as the palliation achieved may be good.
