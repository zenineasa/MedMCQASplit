        "exp": "Ans. B. CO. (Ref. Bailey & Love 26th ed. Pg. 386; Summary box 28.3)Metabolic poisoning in burns:# There are many poisonous gases that can be given off in a fire, the most common being carbon monoxide, a product of incomplete combustion that is often produced by fires in enclosed spaces. This is the usual cause of a person being found with altered consciousness at the scene of a fire.# Carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin with an affinity 240 times greater than that of oxygen and therefore blocks the transport of oxygen. Levels of carboxyhaemoglobin in the bloodstream can be measured. Concentrations above 10% are dangerous and need treatment with pure oxygen for more than 24 hours. Death occurs with concentrations around 60%.# Another metabolic toxin produced in house fires is hydrogen cyanide, which causes a metabolic acidosis by interfering with mitochondrial respiration.Additional educational points:The shock reaction after burns# Bums produce an inflammatory reaction# This leads to vastly increased vascular permeability# Water, solutes and proteins move from the intra- to the extravascular space# The volume of fluid lost is directly proportional to the area of the bum# Above 15% of surface area, the loss of fluid produces shockASPHYXIANTS# Include CO, CO2, Hydrogen sulphide and some war gases.- CO reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood;- Carbon dioxide produces oxygen lack in the tissues;- Hydrogen sulphide paralyses the respiratory centre.Cause of death in burns:# Primary neurogenic shock - instantaneously from fear or pain or within 24-48 hrsfrom severe pains or from injury to vital organ from burning, or from oligemic shock.# If a victim survives this stage, this stage merges rapidly into the stage of secondary shock due to depletion of blood (serum) volume.# Apart from actual burning, death may occur from asphyxia (suffocation) due to inhalation of smoke containing carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other products of combution, which may be poisonous (in recent yrs cyanide intoxication has been recognized as important, especially where plastics and paints are burning), or accidental injuries from falling structures whle trying to escape from abuming house, or from fat embolism.",

The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extra vascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume.# The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i.e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Quantity of crystalloid needed is calculated using the parkland formula-6m/Kg body weight per % of the total body surface area burnt * Proper fluid management is critical to survival in a burn patient.* The hypovolemic shock in burn patient is special in the sense that the total body water remains unchanged in a burn patient. The thermal injury leads to a massive fluid shift from intravascular compartment to the extravascular compartment (interstitial + intracellular) leading to edema formation (in both burned parts and non burned parts of body)* This fluid shift is maximum in the first 24 hrs.* Fluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution - Ringer's lactate solution (RL) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extra vascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume.# The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i.e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas)# Half of the calculated fluid is given in first 8 hrs and half in next 16 hrs.* Colloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capillaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning)* A number of parameters are widely used to assess burn resuscitation, but the most common remain the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patient, the target MAP is 60 mmHg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients.* There is no use of diuretics in burn resuscitation.* Children under 20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",
