Das Textbook of Surgery 5th/1036\"A rectal biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease. In the newborn period, this is done at the bedside with minimal morbidity using a special suction rectal biopsy instrument. It is importantto obtain the sample at least 2 cm above the dentate line to avoid sampling the normal transition from ganglionated bowel to the paucity or absence of ganglia in the region of the internal sphincter. In older children, because the rectal mucosa is thicker, a full-thickness biopsy is obtained under general anesthesia. Absent ganglia, hypertrophied nerve trunks, and robust immunostaining for acetylcholinesterase are the pathologic criteria to make the diagnosis\"-Sobiston 18th/2065\"Rectal suction biopsies are the procedure of choice & should be performed no closer than 2cm to the dentate line to avoid the normal area of hypoganglionosis at the anal verge\"-Nelson 18th/1566\"The definitive diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease is made by rectal biopsy. Samples of mucosa and submucosa are obtained at 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm from the dentate line\"-Schwartz 8th\"Definitive diagnosis is made by rectal biopsy. Mucosal and submucosal biopsies may be taken from the posterior rectal wall with a suction biopsy capsule without anesthesia at the bedside. Serial sections may demonstrate the characteristic lack of ganglion cells and proliferation of nerve trunks in Meissner's plexus. If the findings are equivocal, it is necessary to remove a 1-cm or 2-cm full-thickness strip of mucosa and muscularis from the posterior rectum proximal to the dentate line under anesthesia \"-CSDT 11th/1321.

Hirschsprung's disease occurs in 1 out of every 5000 live births and is characterized pathologically by absent ganglion cells in the myenteric (Auerbach's) and submucosal (Meissners) plexus. This neurogenic abnormality is associated with muscular spasm of the distal colon and internal anal sphincter resulting in a functional obstruction. Hence, the abnormal bowel is the contracted, distal segment, whereas the normal bowel is the proximal, dilated portion. The area between the dilated and contracted segments is referred to as the transition zone.",

The contrast enema in case of Hirschsprung's disease demonstrates a) Aganglionic segment that appears narrow in comparison with the dilated proximal bowel. This zone of the intestine with proximal dilated intestine along with caudal narrow aganglionic segment is the transition zone. b) Normally the rectum is wider than the rest of the colon (except caecum) and when the rectum is seen to be narrower than the proximal colon.

Qare the easiest & most reliable indicators of HD# Rectal suction biopsies a re the procedure of choicec' & should be performed no closer than 2cm to the dentate line to avoid the normal area of hypoganglionosis at the anal verge.# Anorectal manometry measures the pressure of the internal anal sphincter while a balloon is distended in the rectum. In patient with HD, the pressure fails to drop or there is a paradoxical rise in pressure with rectal distension.# Barium enema examination should be done in unprepared bowel as washouts may minimise the dilation of the gut above the obstruction. It is always essential that both AP & lateral views should be taken as narrow short segments may be overlapped by dilated proximal colon in one of the views.
