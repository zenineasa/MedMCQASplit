Explanation: Intussusception. Invagination of an intestinal segment (the intussusception) into the next distal part of the intestine forms a sheath around it (the intussuscipiens) producing a form of intestinal obstruction called 'intussusception'. The most common cause is hypertrophy of the Peyer's patches in the terminal ileum from an antecedent viral infection. The hypertrophied lymphatic patch becomes drawn into the lumen of the terminal ileum and is moved progressively into the ascending and transverse colon. Other predisposing factors include. Polyps. Meckel's diverticulum. Benign tumors like lipoma. Leiomyoma. Malignant tumors such as lymphoma which may act as lead points for intussusception. GI lipomas, most common in the ileum, are single intramural lesion, submucosal in location and usually small. One portion of the gut becomes invaginated within an immediately adjacent segment: almost invariably, it is the proximal into the distal. The condition is encountered most commonly in children, with a peak incidence between 5 and 10 months of age. About 90% of cases are idiopathic but an associated upper respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis may precede the condition. It is believed that hyperplasia of Peyer's patches in the terminal ileum. Weaning, loss of passively acquired maternal immunity and common viral pathogens have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of intussusception in infancy. Children Pathological lead points. Meckel's diverticulum. Polypduplication, Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Appendix. Adult cases lead pointA polyp (e. g. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome)A submucosal lipomaother tumours. Pathology. An intussusception is composed of three parts: The entering or inner tube (intussusceptum). The returning or middle tube: The sheath or outer tube (intussuscipiens). The part that advances is the apex, the mass is the intussusception and the neck is the junction of the entering layer with the mass. An intussusception is an example of a strangulating obstruction as the blood supply of the inner layer is usually impaired. The degree of ischaemia is dependent on the tightness of the invagination, which is usually greatest as it passes through the ileocaecal valve. Intussusception may be anatomically defined according to the site and extent of invagination. In most children, the intussusception is ileocolic. In adults, colocolic intussusception is common. Intussusception. Most common in children. Primary or secondary to intestinal pathology, e. g. polyp. Meckel's diverticulum. Ileocolic is the commonest variety. Can lead to an ischaemic segment. Radiological reduction is indicated in most cases. The remainder require surgery",

        "question": "A 6 months old child woke up in night, crying with ahdominal pain, which got relieved on passing red stool. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Ans. b. Intussusception (Ref; Ghai 8/e p287; Sabiston 19/e p1851; Schwartz 9/e p1433-I434; Bailey 26/e 1184. 1187, 1193. 25/e p1191, 1196. 1198; Shackelford 7/e p1059-106). Most likely diagnosis in a 6 months old child, who woke up in night, crying with abdominal pain, which got relieved on passing red stool, is intussusception. 'Intussusception refers to the telescoping of a proximal segment of intestine (intussusceptum) into a distal segment (intussuscipiens). This is a common cause of intestinal obstruction in children between 3 months and 6 years. Most cases occur in infants during the weaning period following introduction of a new food, vaccination or upper respiratory tract infection. The classic triad of abdominal pain, red current jelly stools (blood and mucus) and palpable mass is seen only in a small percentage of children. Ultrasound is the investigation of choice that confirms the diagnosis ('dough nut' sign) and provides information about presence of a mass as lead point. Early reduction either with saline (under ultrasound guidance), barium contrast (both diagnostic and therapeutic) or with air insufflation is advisable. Reduction with air is safer with lower recurrence rates. Failure of radiological reduction or suspected intestinal gangrene may necessitate surgery and resection. '- Ghai 8/e p287. Intussusception. Telescoping of one portion of the intestine into the other. Middle layer is isolated between two sharp bends and first to become gangrenousQ. Highest incidence between 4 and 10 monthsQ of age. Approx. 80-90% of cases occurs between 3 and 36 monthsQ. Mostly idiopathic in infants and toddlersQ (no clear etiology). MC type: Ileocolic. QEtiology and Predisposing Factors: Upper respiratory tract infections or gastroenteritisQ (adenovirus and rotavirus have been implicated) have been thought to be contributory to the development of 'idiopathic' intussusception. Hypertrophy of Peyer's patchesQ can be seen at surgery, but no single etiologic factor predominates. Approximately 5-10% of cases have a true pathologic lead point. The older the toddler, the more likely there will be a lead pointQ. MC lead point is Meckel's diverticulumQ. Other lead points include polyps, the appendix, intestinal duplication, foreign bodies, and tumors such as hamartomas associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Henoch-Schonlein purpura: Submucosal hemorrhage acts as a lead pointQ. Cystic fibrosis: Risk for recurrent intussusception. QClinical Features: Typical history: Sudden, short-duration, cyclic crampy abdominal painQ. During these episodes the infant cries inconsolably with the knees drawn upQ. Between episodes the infant is asymptomaticQ. Vomiting is almost universalQ. Initially the passage of stools may be normal while later on blood mixed with mucus is evacuated- red currant jelly stool. An abdominal mass may be palpated- a sausage shaped abdominal massQ (increase in size and firmness during the paroxysm of pain). There may be an associated feeling of emptiness in the right iliac fossa (Sign of Dance)QOccult or gross blood in 60-90% of cases on rectal examination. QApex may be palpable or even protrude from anus in extensive ileocolic or colocoiic intussusception. QDiagnosis: USG: Kidney-shaped mass in the longitudinal view or a target sign in the transverse view. Hydrostatic reduction by contrast agent or air enema (preferred) is the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of choiceQ. Successful reduction is confirmed by reflux of airQ (or barium) into the small bowel. Treatment: Hydrostatic reduction by contrast agent or air enema is the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of choiceQ. The success rate with air or barium reduction should exceed 70%Q. Failure of reduction or the presence of peritonitis mandates operative interventionQ, which can be performed laparoscopically or by a standard approach. Definitive surgical procedure: Ileocolectomy with primary anastomosis. QRecurrence: Recurrence after successful hydrostatic reduction is 5-10%, recurrence rate after operative reduction is 1-4%. Recurrence is usually managed by hydrostatic reductionQ. Third recurrenceQ is an indication for operative intervention to look for a lead point.",

        "exp": "Ans: C (Sub mucosal lipoma) Ref: Bailey and Love's Short Practice of Surgery. 25th edition Chapter 66, Intestinal Obstruction pg: 1191-1212 and Donald A, Antonioli, \"Gastro-intestinal Autonomic Nerve Tumors, expanding the spectrum of gastrointestinal stromal tumors\", Arch Pathol Lab Med 1989; 113; 831-833. Explanation: Intussusception consists of telescoping of a bop of bowel inside itself. It may or may not originate from a lead point, which is usually a swelling of the mucosa or submucosa (eg: Inf lammed Peyer's patch, mucosal adenoma, submucosal lipoma). \" Ref: Clinical Surgery, Alfred Cuschieri, 2nd edition. Intussusception. Portion of the gut becomes invaginated within an immediately adjacent segment. Usually the proximal segment gets invaginated into the distal. Most commonly in children. Peak incidence - 5 to 10 months of age. Primary or secondary to intestinal pathology, e. g., polyp. Ileocolic is the most common variety. Aetiology and Risk Factors: 90% of cases are idiopathic. Upper respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis may precede the condition. Hyperplasia of Payer's patches in the terminal ileum may be the initiating event. Risk Factors in Infants: Weaning. Loss of passively acquire maternal immunity. Common viral pathogens. Risk Factors in Older Children: Pathological lead points are common in children more than 2 years of age. o Meckel's diverticulum. o Polyp, o Duplication. o Henoch -Schonlein purpura. o Appendix. o Submucosal Gl lipoma {Most Common in ileum, are single submucosal, intramural lesion), o Leiomyoma. Risk Factors in Adults: Invariably associated with a lead point. Polyp (e. g. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Submucosal lipoma. Other tumours. Pathology. An intussusception is composed of three parts: The entering or inner tube. The returning or middle tube. The sheath or outer tube (intussuscipiens).* The part that advances is the apex, the mass is the intussusceptions and the neck is the junction of the entering layer with the mass. An intussusception is a strangulating obstruction as the blood supply of the inner layer is usually impaired. The degree of ischaemia is dependent on the tightness of the invagination, which is usually greatest as it passes through the ileocaecal valve. Most common intussusception in children is ileocolic. Most common intussusception in adults is colocolic. Clinical Features: Episodes of screaming and drawing up of the legs in a previously well male infant. The attacks last for a few minutes and recur repeatedly. During attacks the child appears pale, whereas between episodes he may be listless. Initially vomiting which becomes bile-stained later. In early stage the passage of stool may be normal, later, blood and mucus are evacuated - the 'red currant jelly' stool. Physical Examination: Child should be examined between episodes of colic. Classically, the abdomen is not initially distended. Lump that hardens on palpation is present in 60% of cases. Emptiness in the right iliac fossa--the sign of Dance. Rectal examination--blood stained mucus may be found on the finger. Occasionally, in extensive intussusception, the apex may be palpable or even protrude from the anus. Progressive dehydration and abdominal distension from small bowel obstruction ensues without treatment, followed by peritonitis secondary to gangrene. Rarely, natural cure may occur as a result of sloughing of the intussusceptions. Imaging: Plain Abdominal X-ray. Evidence of small or large bowel obstruction with an absent caecal gas shadow in ileocolic cases. A soft tissue opacity is often present. Barium Enema. Claw sign in ileocolic intussusception. Does not demonstrate small bowel intussusception. Ultrasound. Doughnut appearance of concentric rings in transverse section. Computerised Tomography (CT). Used in equivocal cases. Treatment. In infants with ileocolic intussusception non-operative reduction is tried first. More than 70% of intussusceptions can be reduced non- operatively. Resuscitation with intravenous fluids. Broad-spectrum antibiotics. Naso-gastric drainage. Non-Operative Reduction. Non-operative reduction is attempted using an air or barium enema. Successful reduction can only be accepted if there is free reflux of air or barium into the small bowel, together with resolution of symptoms and signs. Contraindications for Non-Operative Reduction. Signs of peritonitis or perforation. Known pathological lead point. Shock. Problems with Non-Operative Reduction: Strangulated bowel and pathological lead points are unlikely to reduce. Perforation of the colon -- rare. Recurrent intussusception occurs in up to 10%. Surgical Management. Indicated when radiological reduction has failed or is contraindicated.",

Adynamic ileus or Paralytic ileusis seen commonly after abdominal operations, or post inflammatory conditions of abdomen eg Appendicitis, peritonitis, pancreatitis. Metabolic abnormalities are also a cause. Abdominal distention, usually without the colicky abdominal pain, is the typical & most notable finding. Vomiting may occur but may also be absent. Absent or hypoactive bowel sounds. Multiple air fluid levels on x-ray, Points b & e help in ruling out adynamic ileus. Pseudoobstruction. This condition describes an obstruction, usually of the colon in the absence of any mechanical cause. This may occur in acute or chronic form (Acute form is k/a Ogilvie syndrome*) Acute form usually involves only the colon. Vomitting appear late or even absent. Abd. cramps appear late. Abd. distention is the chief symptom. Since it usually involves the colon air fluid level are not seen if the ileo-cecal valve is intact. Points c, d, e help in ruling out Pseudoobstruction in this pt. Ca Rectum: Usually a ds. of old age. Obstruction is not a common presentation Even if obstruction occurs, it is insidious in onset with pain & vomiting a late feature. There will be abdominal distention. These point help in ruling Ca Rectum out. Duodenal obstruction. Features of this pt. match perfectly with duodenal obstruction as. Pain and vomitting are early features. No distention of bowel. No air fluid level. (There is no distention of bowel and no air fluid level as whole of the intestinal tract distal to the obstruction is patent allowing free passage to gas and the fluids out of body.

        "exp": "Ans: C (The outer tube) Ref: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 25th Edition pg. 1191. Explanation: Intussuscipiens refers to the sheath or outer tube of intussusception. Intussusception. Portion of the gut becomes invaginated within an immediately adjacent segment. Usually the proximal segment gets invaginated into the distal. Most commonly in children. Peak incidence - 5 to 10 months of age. Aetiology and Risk Factors90% of cases are idiopathic. Upper respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis may precede the condition. Hyperplasia of peyer's patches in the terminal ileum may he the initiating event. Risk Factors in Infants. Weaning. Loss of passively acquire maternal immunity. Common viral pathogens. Risk Factors in Older Children. Pathological lead points are common in children more than 2 years of age. After the age of 2 years, a pathological lead point is found in at least one-third of affected children. Meckel's diverticulum. Polyp. Duplication. Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Appendix. Risk Factors in Adults. Invariably associated with a lead point. Polyp (e. g. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Submucosal lipoma. Other tumours. Pathology. An intussusception is composed of three parts: The entering or inner tube. The returning or middle tube. The sheath or outer tube (intussuscipiens). The part that advances is the apex, the mass is the intussusceptions and the neck is the junction of the entering layer with the mass. An intussusception is a strangulating obstruction as the blood supply of the inner layer is usually impaired. The degree of ischaemia is dependent on the tightness of the invagination, which is usually greatest as it passes through the ileocaecal valve. Most common intussusception in children is ileocolic. Most common intussusception in adults is coiocolic. Clinical Features. The classical presentation is with episodes of screaming and drawing up of the legs in a previously well male infant. The attacks last for a few minutes and recur repeatedly. During attacks the child appears pale, whereas between episodes he may be listless. Initially vomiting may or may not occur but becomes conspicuous and bile-stained with time. In early stage the passage of stool may be normal, later, blood and mucus are evacuated - the 'red currant jelly* stool. Physical Examination. Child should be examined between episodes of colic. Classically, the abdomen is not initially distended. Lump that hardens on palpation is present in 60% of cases. Emptiness in the right iliac fossa- the sign of Dance. Rectal examination- blood stained mucus maybe found on the finger. Occasionally, in extensive intussusception, the apex may be palpable or even protrude from the anus. Progressive dehydration and abdominal distension from small bowel obstruction ensues without treatment, followed by peritonitis secondary to gangrene. Rarely, natural cure may occur as a result of sloughing of the intussusceptions. Imaging. Plain Abdominal X-ray. Evidence of small or targe bowel obstruction with an absent caecal gas shadow in ileocolic cases. A soft tissue opacity is often present. Barium Enema. Claw sign in ileocolic intussusception. Does not demonstrate small bowel intussusception. Ultrasound. Doughnut appearance of concentric rings in transverse section. Computerised Tomography (CT). Used in equivocal cases. Treatment. In infants with ileocolic intussusception non-operative reduction is tried first. More than 70% of intussusceptions can be reduced non-operativelv. Resuscitation with intravenous fluids. Broad-spectrum antibiotics. Naso-gastric drainage. Non-Operative Reduction. Non-operative reduction is attempted using an air or barium enema. Successful reduction can only be accepted if there is free reflux of air or barium into the small bowel, together with resolution of symptoms and signs. Contraindications for Non-Operative Reduction. Signs of peritonitis or perforation. Known pathological lead point. Shock. Problems with Non-Operative Reduction: Strangulated bowel and pathological lead points are unlikely to reduce. Perforation of the colon - rare. Recurrent intussusception occurs in upto 10%. Surgical Management. Indicated when radiological reduction has failed or is contraindicated.",
