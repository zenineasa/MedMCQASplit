        "question": "Rapid fluid resuscitation of the hypovolemic patient after abdominal trauma is significantly enhanced by which of the following?",
        "exp": "Rapid fluid administration is often the key to successful trauma resuscitation. Some of the important factors affecting the rate of fluid resuscitation include the diameter of the intravenous tubing, the size and length of the venous cannulae, the fluid viscosity, and the site of administration. According to Poiseuille's law, flow is proportional to the fourth power of the radius of a catheter and inversely proportional to its length. Therefore, the shorter a catheter and the larger its diameter, the faster one can infuse a solution through it. Central venous placement alone does not assure rapid flow. Importantly, the diameter of the intravenous tubing employed may be the rate-determining factor in fluid delivery: blood-infusion tubing allows twice the flow of standard intravenous tubing and should be used when rapid fluid resuscitation is needed. Any patient who is suspected of having a major abdominal injury should immediately have at least two short, large-bore (16-gauge or larger) intravenous cannulae placed in peripheral veins. Longer, smaller catheters, such as standard 18-gauge central venous catheters, may take more time to place and will have lower flow rates. Once fluid resuscitation is under way, one may elect to place an 8- or 9-French pulmonary artery catheter-introducer via a central venous approach for further volume administration, as well as for measurement of central venous pressure or for Swan-Ganz catheter insertion. Lower-extremity venous cannulae, placed by saphenous vein cutdown or percutaneously into the femoral veins, are no longer advised as primary access for patients with abdominal trauma, since possible disruption of iliac veins or the inferior vena cava will render volume infusion ineffective. Studies have demonstrated that the flow rate of cold whole blood is roughly two-thirds that of whole blood at room temperature. Diluting and warming the blood by \"piggybacking\" it into infusion lines that are delivering crystalloid will decrease the blood's viscosity, enhance flow, and minimize hypothermia.",

        "exp": "CSDT says \"following injury, neural impulses carried spinothalamic pathways activate the brain stem and thalamic and coical centres, which stimulate the hypothalamus. Hypothalamic stimulation triggers combined neural and endocrine discharges. Norepinephrine is released sympathetic nerve endings, epinephrine from the adrenal medulla, aldosterone from the adrenal coex, ADH from the adrenal coex, ADH from the posterior pituitary, glucagon from the pancreas, and ACTH, TSH and growth hormone from the anterior pituitary. These hormones produce secondary elevation of coisol, thyroid hormone and somatomedins. Hormones Increased In Response to Surgical Stress Catecholamines: The plasma catecholamines increase immediately after trauma and acheive peak concentration in 24-48 hours depending on the severity. Glucagon: Glucagon along with catecholamine and coisol promotes and prolongs the liver glycogenesis. Coisol: Hypothalamus during stress secretes ACTH, which in turn initiates sudden increase in coisol levels. Growth hormone: The secretion of GH is governed by hypothalamic factors, autonomic stimulation and non-hormonal signals. The primary metabolic action of GH during stress is to promote protein synthesis and enhance lipid breakdown, and glucose stores. Vasopressin (ADH) Aldosterone Renin-Angiotensin Plasma concentration of insulin during stress has been noted to be biphasic, characterized by the suppression of insulin secretion followed by a normal secretion.

        "question": "In trauma to the neck which indicates immediate management",
        "exp": "Trauma to neck Immediate Management Neck injuries can often require rapid intervention because of the vulnerability of the contained vital structures. The highest priority concern is establishment of a secure airway, especially given the rapidity with which deterioration can occur in the setting of a neck injury. Direct injury to the larynx or trachea is the most common cause of airway compromise. Expanding neck hemato- mas can quickly compress the upper airway, leading to inadequate ventilation. Immediate intubation should occur in the setting of an expanding neck hematoma or if there is concern about impend- ing airway compromise. Suspected laryngotracheal injury presents one of the most challenging airway management situations. Patients who are maintaining their own airway should have a planned approach to airway management that might include intu- bation or awake tracheostomy in the operating room. Attempted intubation could worsen a tenuous situation and should not be performed without a well-developed backup plan. A loss of airway requires emergent intervention that might include performing a surgical airway. The surgical airway of choice for an upper airway injury is a tracheostomy because injury to the larynx could make cricothyroidotomy ineffective. In the immediate setting, hemorrhage is the other major concern that might occur after neck injury. Direct pressure effec- tively manages most bleeding from the neck, at least during transpo to the operating room and initiation of neck explora- tion. Injury to the large vessels of the neck will often require control in the operating room. Bleeding should be immediately treated with digital pressure on the wound until operative expo- sure can be achieved. Large quantities of blood can be lost quickly, so resuscitation with blood products should be rapidly initiated. Patients with suspected injury should be rapidly trans- ferred to the operating room for surgical management of ongoing bleeding. Ref: Sabiston 20th edition Pgno: 423",

It presents with myxoedema, amenorrhoea, infeility, headache, visual disturbances, bitemporal hemianopia, blindness, intracranial hypertension, epilepsy. Differential diagnosis: Meningiomas, aneurysms. CT scan, angiogram, X-ray skull are diagnostic. Treatment is surgical decompression by craniotomy through subfrontal approach or trans-sphenoidal approach. Deep external radiotherapy and steroids are also used. 3. Basophil adenomas are usually small. They secrete ACTH and presents as Cushing's disease with all its features. 4. Prolactin-secreting adenomas causes infeility, amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea. It can be of two types Microprolactinomas - < 10mm Macroprolactinoma - > 10 mm Classification II Hypersecreting Hyposecreting by compression and atrophy Classification III Micronodular: Tumour size less than 10 mm Macronodular: Tumour size more than 10 mm Stages Stage of intrasellar development Stage of suprasellar extension Stage of massive intracranial extension Ref: SRB's Manual of Surgery 5th edition Pgno: 1105",

The paradoxical motion increases the work of breathing and most impoant consequence is respiratory failure Until recently it was belived that ineffective air movement between both lungs caused by paradoxical motion of the chest wall was the cause of respiratory distress in patients with flail chest. It is now understood that the underlying pulmonary contusion and pain during inspiration are the main componentsin the pathophysiology of respiratory failure MANAGEMENT patients without evidence of respiratory distress can be managed with only analgesics. pain control can be provided by intercostal nerve block or more adequately by epidural anaesthesia if respiratory distress develops - endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with peak end expiratory pressure are usually indicated, provided that pain control is adequate sequential aerial blood gas determination may gauge the severity of injury and is useful to determine the need for mechanical ventilation.

Firstly, high-energy injury mechanisms can result in the rupture of coical surface vessels with significant associated primary brain injury. This results in expanding haematoma with rapid deterioration anddeveloping signs of raised ICP, reminiscent of extradural haematoma without the lucid interval. These collections require prompt evacuation, typically by craniotomy or craniectomy. In a second group of patients, older and often anticoagulated, a lower-energy injury leads to venous bleeding around the brain. Depending on the total volume of bleeding, the resulting haematoma may present early as acute subdural haematoma, after delay and osmotic expansion as chronic sub- dural haematoma or may even remain clinically silent. This latter group may present much later with a fuher 'acute-on- chronic' subdural haematoma. On diagnosis, clotting function should be corrected wherever possible. Bleeds of significant size, with significant associated midline shift or with deteriorating neurology, require urgent evacuation. Smaller bleeds in neurologically stable patients may be managed conservatively, at least initially: liquefaction of the clot over 7-10 days after the bleed may allow for a much less invasive evacuation through burr holes. Since the dura is not adherent to the brain as it is to the skull, subdural blood is free to expand across the brain surface giving a diffuse concave appearance.

The negative nitrogen balance represents the net result of breakdown and synthesis (with breakdown increased and synthesis increased or diminished). Amino acids such as alanine are released by muscle and transported to the liver for incorporation into acute-phase proteins including fibrinogen, complement, haptoglobin, and ferritin. The amino acids also undergo gluconeogenesis to glucose, which is utilized primarily by the brain and other glycolytic tissues such as peripheral nerves, erythrocytes, and bone marrow. Other tissues receive energy from fat in the form of fatty acids or ketone bodies during starvation following major trauma; this helps to conserve body protein. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the blood, and its levels in muscle and blood decrease following injury and sepsis as it is consumed rapidly by replicating fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and intestinal endothelial cells. The use of glutamine may decrease protein catabolism in the intestine and may help prevent atrophy of the gastrointestinal tract in starved and parenterally nourished patients. Along with the counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol), interleukin 1 appears to mediate muscle breakdown. Recent studies have indicated that TNF (also called cachectin because of the role it plays in muscle wasting in septic or oncologic patients) also may be a principal catabolic cytokine in the traumatized patient. This protein is secreted by macrophages and further affects metabolism by inducing secretion of interleukin 1 and inhibiting synthesis and activity of lipogenic enzymes.",

General: Liver trauma* The liver is the second most common organ injured in abdominal trauma.* Liver trauma can be divided into blunt and penetrating injuries.* Blunt injury produces contusion, laceration and avulsion injuries to the liver, often in association with splenic, mesenteric or renal injury.* Penetrating injuries, such as stab and gunshot wounds, are often associated with chest or pericardial involvement.* Blunt injuries are more common and have a higher mortality than penetrating injuries. Diagnosis of liver injury:* The liver is an extremely well-vascularised organ, and blood loss is therefore the major early complication of liver injuries.* Clinical suspicion of a possible liver injury is essential, as a laparotomy by an inexperienced surgeon with inadequate preparation preoperatively is doomed to failure.* All lower chest and upper abdominal stab wounds should be suspect, especially if considerable blood volume replacement has been required.* Similarly, severe crushing injuries to the lower chest or upper abdomen often combine rib fractures, haemothorax and damage to the spleen and/or liver.* Focused assessment sonography in trauma (FAST) performed in the emergency room by an experienced operator can reliably diagnose free intraperitoneal fluid.* Patients with free intraperitoneal fluid on FAST and haemodynamic instability, and patients with a penetrating wound will require a laparotomy and/or thoracotomy once active resuscitation is under way.* Owing to the opportunity for massive ongoing blood loss and the rapid development of a coagulopathy, the patient should be directly transferred to the operating theatre while blood products are obtained and volume replacement is taking place.* Patients who are haemodynamically stable should have a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest and abdomen as the next step.* Additional investigations that may be of value include diagnostic peritoneal lavage, which can confirm the presence of haemoperitoneum, but this is rarely performed nowadays due to inceased use of FAST and CT. Initial management:* The initial management is maintenance of airway patency, breathing and circulation (ABC) following the principles of advanced trauma life support (ATLS).* Peripheral venous access is gained with two large-bore cannulae and blood sent for crossmatch of ten units of blood, full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, clotting screen, glucose and amylase.* Initial volume replacement should be with colloid or O-negative blood if necessary. Arterial blood gases should be obtained and the patient intubated and ventilated if the gas exchange is inadequate.* Intercostal chest drains should be inserted if associated pneumothorax or haemothorax is suspected. Once initial resuscitation has commenced, the patient should be transferred to the operating theatre, with further resuscitation performed on the operating table.* The necessity for fresh-frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate should be discussed with the blood transfusion service immediately the patient arrives, as these patients rapidly develop irreversible coagulopathies due to a lack of fibrinogen and clotting factors.* Standard coagulation profiles are inadequate to evaluate this acute loss of clotting factors, and factors should be given empirically, aided by the results of thromboelastography (TEG), if available.* A contrast CT prior to laparotomy should be considered if the patient is haemodynamically stable.",

        "exp": "The sudden onset of tachycardia and hypotension indicates an acute process. Since the patient is being mechanically ventilated with positive pressure, he is at increased risk of a bullous rupture from barotrauma, leading to a pneumothorax. Cardiac arrhythmia could lead to tachycardia and hypotension. Ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response may cause this from decreased ventricular filling. An ECG would aid in this diagnosis. In the setting of mechanical ventilation, however, a pneumothorax must be excluded first. Bronchial secretions usually have a progressively worsening presentation. Fuhermore, the patient would exhibit desaturation, but not necessarily hypotension. Myocardial infarction may lead to cardiogenic shock from failure. However, this would most likely be a bit more progressive and less acute. Infarction must remain high on the differential diagnosis, and the patient may require vasopressors because of the shock. In the immediate setting, the pneumothorax is more likely, given the acuity of onset. Pulmonary embolus is on the differential diagnosis of electromechanical dissociation.

An injured individual who does not receive nutrition for 10 days can theoritically loose 15% of lean body mass. Protein catabolism after injury provides substrates for gluconeogenesis and for the synthesis of acute phase proteins. Skeletal muscle proteins are the first to deplete acutely after an injury whereas visceral proteins remain relatively preserved.

General: Liver trauma* The liver is the second most common organ injured in abdominal trauma.* Liver trauma can be divided into blunt and penetrating injuries.* Blunt injury produces contusion, laceration and avulsion injuries to the liver, often in association with splenic, mesenteric or renal injury.* Penetrating injuries, such as stab and gunshot wounds, are often associated with chest or pericardial involvement.* Blunt injuries are more common and have a higher mortality than penetrating injuries. Diagnosis of liver injury:* The liver is an extremely well-vascularised organ, and blood loss is therefore the major early complication of liver injuries.* Clinical suspicion of a possible liver injury is essential, as a laparotomy by an inexperienced surgeon with inadequate preparation preoperatively is doomed to failure.* All lower chest and upper abdominal stab wounds should be suspect, especially if considerable blood volume replacement has been required.* Similarly, severe crushing injuries to the lower chest or upper abdomen often combine rib fractures, haemothorax and damage to the spleen and/or liver.* Focused assessment sonography in trauma (FAST) performed in the emergency room by an experienced operator can reliably diagnose free intraperitoneal fluid.* Patients with free intraperitoneal fluid on FAST and haemodynamic instability, and patients with a penetrating wound will require a laparotomy and/or thoracotomy once active resuscitation is under way.* Owing to the opportunity for massive ongoing blood loss and the rapid development of a coagulopathy, the patient should be directly transferred to the operating theatre while blood products are obtained and volume replacement is taking place.* Patients who are haemodynamically stable should have a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest and abdomen as the next step.* Additional investigations that may be of value include diagnostic peritoneal lavage, which can confirm the presence of haemoperitoneum, but this is rarely performed nowadays due to inceased use of FAST and CT. Initial management:* The initial management is maintenance of airway patency, breathing and circulation (ABC) following the principles of advanced trauma life support (ATLS).* Peripheral venous access is gained with two large-bore cannulae and blood sent for crossmatch of ten units of blood, full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, clotting screen, glucose and amylase.* Initial volume replacement should be with colloid or O-negative blood if necessary. Arterial blood gases should be obtained and the patient intubated and ventilated if the gas exchange is inadequate.* Intercostal chest drains should be inserted if associated pneumothorax or haemothorax is suspected. Once initial resuscitation has commenced, the patient should be transferred to the operating theatre, with further resuscitation performed on the operating table.* The necessity for fresh-frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate should be discussed with the blood transfusion service immediately the patient arrives, as these patients rapidly develop irreversible coagulopathies due to a lack of fibrinogen and clotting factors.* Standard coagulation profiles are inadequate to evaluate this acute loss of clotting factors, and factors should be given empirically, aided by the results of thromboelastography (TEG), if available.* A contrast CT prior to laparotomy should be considered if the patient is haemodynamically stable.",

Clearly, attention must also be directed at assuring adequacy of ventilation (potential right pneumothorax), assessing and treating obvious hemorrhage, determining if there is occult intra-abdominal or thoracic hemorrhage, and determining the patient's neurologic status.

It is due to injury to the coical veins and often due to laceration of coex of brain which bleeds and blood gets collected in the subdural space forming a haematoma. Here haematoma is extensive and diffuse. There is no lucid interval. There is severe primary brain damage. Haematoma may be of coup and contre-coup type. Loss of consciousness occurs immediately after trauma and Is progressive. Convulsion is common. Features of raised intracranial pressure is obviously seen high BP, bradycardia, vomiting. Focal neurological deficits or hemiparesis can occur. CT scan shows concavo-convex lesion. Treatment Antibiotics, anticonvulsants. Surgical decompression is done by craniotomy. Chronic Subdural Haematoma It is due to the rupture of veins between dura and brain (cerebral hemispheres), causing gradual collection of blood in subdural space. It is commonly seen in elderly people following any minor trauma like fall, slipping (which might have gone unnoticed). In elderly people, brain atrophies and even minor injuries can cause shearing and bleeding from these veins. Blood collects gradually over 2-6 weeks. Plasma and cellular components get separated. Eventually cellular pa gets absorbed leaving only fluid component. It is called as chronic subdural hygroma. Usual haematoma collection is 60-120 ml. Often in 50% of cases, it is bilateral. Clinical Features Common in old age, with history of minor trauma. Patient presents with confusion, disorientation, gradually with altered level of consciousness and drowsiness. Later convulsions, features of intracranial hypertension, features of coning develops. Extensor plantar response and pupillary changes develop eventually. Investigations CT scan (shows concavo-convex lesion). Serum electrolytes. Blood grouping and cross matching. Differential Diagnosis Electrolyte imbalance. Intracranial space occupying lesion. Treatment Craniotomy and evacuation of clot is done when required on both sides. Antibiotics. Anticonvulsants for 3 years.

Bedside U/S evaluates the perisplenic space, perihepatic space, pericardium, and pelvis for free fluid. In these locations fluid is not typically present, therefore in combination with a clinical suspicion such as hypotension following blunt trauma, should trigger the consideration of an internal injury. For an unstable patient with these findings should be taken to the OR for immediate surgical exploration. USG is used to diagnose intra-abdominal injuries in unstable patients. For a stable patient in whom the diagnosis is less definite should be taken for a more definitive study, i. e., CT scan with intravenous contrast. CT will reveal the presence of intra-abdominal fluid and can accurately delineate the source, typically the liver or spleen. CECT is used to diagnose intra-abdominal injuries in unstable patients.

Clinical features of rectus sheath hematomaA) Symptoms* Common historical features of rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) include acute abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. B) Signsi) Vital signs# A low-grade fever is common in rectus sheath hematoma. The hematoma can be large enough to compromise intravascular volume, with resultant signs of hypovolemic shock including hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. ii) Abdominal examination# Typically, the abdominal examination reveals a palpable, painful, firm, nonpulsatile abdominal mass corresponding to the rectus sheath. The mass may be bilobar with a central groove. The mass does not move with respiration. Because the hematoma is deep to the subcutaneous tissue and rectus muscles, the mass is not always palpable, particularly in obese patients.",
