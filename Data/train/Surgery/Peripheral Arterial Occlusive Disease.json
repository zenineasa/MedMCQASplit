An inflammatory and obliterative disease of blood vessels of the extremities, mainly lower extremities. Occurring chiefly in smoker young men and leading to ischemia of the tissues and gangrene. Involvement of artery vein and nerve, most commonly involved is tibial artery. Intermittent claudication, pain at rest relieved by dangling legs. Dry gangrene in toes shows shriveled woody induration.IOC: Duplex USG (ankle brachial index: 0.5 to 0.9)Treatment: For Claudication pain, reducing the viscosity of blood pentoxifylline is used. For resting pain, lumbar sympathectomy. If gangrene, amputation done.Image source- style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif\">",

This disorder develops most frequently in men <40 years of ageThe clinical features of thromboangiitis obliterans often include a triad of claudication of the affected extremity, Raynaud's phenomenon, and migratory superficial vein thrombophlebitis. Claudication usually is confined to the calves and feet or the forearms and hands because this disorder primarily affects distal vessels. In the presence of severe digital ischemia, trophic nail changes, painful ulcerations, and gangrene may develop at the tips of the fingers or toes. The physical examination shows normal brachial and popliteal pulses but reduced or absent radial, ulnar, and/or tibial pulses. Arteriography is helpful in making the diagnosis. Smooth, tapering segmental lesions in the distal vessels are characteristic, as are collateral vessels at sites of vascular occlusion. Proximal atherosclerotic disease is usually absent. The diagnosis can be confirmed by excisional biopsy and pathologic examination of an involved vessel.",
