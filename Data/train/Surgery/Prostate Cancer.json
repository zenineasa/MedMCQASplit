Incidentally diagnosed Tla and T1b disease. For men >70 years: Conservative treatment would usually he the correct approach. For men < 65 years: Radical surgical treatment. Localised T2 disease. In younger fitter men (<65 years): Radical prostatectomy or radical radiotherapy. In patients with outflow obstruction: Transurethral resection +- hormone therapy. Locally advanced T3 and T4 disease. These patients are at significant risk of disease progression. Early androgen ablation is favoured. For the sexually active: Conservative approach with the adoption of androgen ablation. Metastatic disease. Once nietastases have developed the out-look is poor. For patients with symptoms: androgen ablation will provide symptomatic relief. GnrH analogues. Treatment options for men with organ-confined prostate cancer include. Radical prostatectomy. External-beam radiation therapy. Interstitial radiotherapy (brachytherapy). Hormonal therapy with either bilateral orchiectomy or. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (reserved for men with locally advanced or metastatic disease). Staging using the Ca Prostate. T1a, T1b and T1c: These are incidentally found tumours in a clinically benign gland after histological examination of a prostatec-tomy specimen. T1a is a well or moderately well- differentiated tumour involving less than 5 per cent of the resected specimen. T1b is a poorly differentiated tumour or a tumour involving >5 percent of the resected specimen. T1c tumours are impalpable tumours found following PSA screening. T2a disease presents as a suspicious nodule on rectal examination of <2 cm. T2b disease is a nodule involving greater than 2 cm. T2e is tumour in both lobes but still clinically confined. T3 is a tumour involving the seminal vesicles or bladder neck. T4 is a tumour involving the rectum or pelvic side wall",

Cancers with a higher Gleason score are more aggressive and have a worse prognosis. The pathologist assigns a Gleason score based on the sum ot' two numbers: The first number is the grade of the most common tumor pattern. The second number is the grade of the second most common pattern. If there are three patterns the first number is the most common and the second is the one with the highest grade.",

Saline cannot be used because electrolytes in the irrigation fluid will dissipate the electric current used to resect the prostate \"-- Schwartz 8/e pi530 (not given in 9/e)o During transurethral resection of prostate strips of tissue are cut from the bladder neck down to the level of verumontanum. o This cutting is performed by a loop mounted on the hand held trigger of the resectoscope in which Diathermy current is being passed. o We all know that normal saline is a very good conductor of electricity (as it contain ions - Na+ & Cl- ions). So if it is used while performing TURP, the diathermy current used in the procedure will cause electrolyte diassociation of normal saline and the current will not be localized in the loop and hence cutting of the tissue will not be proper. o You can put up a question that the same can occur with the use of distilled water too. o Distilled wrater can also conduct electricity-but the current used during TURP is not very strong and distilled water is not as good conductor of electricity' as Normal saline. (You must be aware that distilled water is a worse conductor of electricity than normal water.)o There were also arguments that distilled water causes fluid overload and therefore should not be used in TURP. True, distilled water causes fluid overload or TURP syndrome but this complication is not common. Distilled water is being replaced by 1[?]5% glycine but still can be used for TURP (and is used in many centres when glycine is not available)o Do not get confused by what is Written in -Bailey 24th/ep. 1377, 1378 (23/e, pi245, 1246). If you go through it carefully, you will find that Bailey states that normal saline is used after the operation i. e. it is used for post operative irrigation.",
