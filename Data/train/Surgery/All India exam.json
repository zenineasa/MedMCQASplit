It may be used postoperatively, preoperatively, or as the sole treatment. -- Pharmacologic therapy with antiestrogens and prostaglandin inhibitors may also be used. -- chemotherapeutic regimen: Recurrent extra-abdominal: doxorubicin, dacarbazine, and carboplatin may be effective Intra abdominal: May respond to systemic doxorubicin, and ifosfamide Differential diagnosis Fibrosarcoma: atypia or mitotic figures present L GIST: strong CD117+, CD34+ b Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis inflammatory, strangles the ureters Leiomvoma: bright pink cytoplasm of smooth muscle, desmin+ L Low grade fibromvxoid sarcoma: heavily collagenized stroma with abrupt transition to myxoid areas, often epithelioid areas or poorly formed but large collagen rosettes; beta catenin negative Neurofibroma: no myofibroblasts, S100+ Schwannoma: palisading Schwann cells, usually minimal collagen, S100+ L Sclerosing omentitis: grows like panniculitis, beta catenin negative Wide excision Ref: Bailey and love surgery text book 27th Ed.",

Plasma levels of CEA can be determined readily by radioimmunoassay. However, its usefulness in colon carcinogenesis screening is limited because of its high level in the plasma of a patient&; s malignancies originating from other sites such as breast, pancreas, stomach and lung. Fuhermore, CEA plasma levels may also be increased in smokers or patients with chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, bronchitis and alcoholic liver disease. The clinical usefulness of CEA for screening purposes is fuher limited by the fact that its increase in level typically occurs only when the tumor penetrates through the serosa. Thus, early lesions may not be detected by serum CEA level changes. CEA is typically elevated with metastatic liver disease, but rarely with peritoneal involvement. Thus, while the specificity for CEA to identify occult CRCs is high, the sensitivity is low in most studies for screening. Accordingly, CEA is not a useful test for the screening of CRC.

This prolapsed ureteral mucosa carries with it a poion of the continuous sheet of the bladder mucosa around the orifice. The prolapsed segment thus has a wall that consists of a thin layer of muscle and collagen interposed between the bladder uroepithelium and the ureter uroepithelium. Since the terminal ureteral orifice is usually narrowed and paially obstructed, and since there is no muscle suppo for the double mucosal walls of the prolapsed segment, it dilates. This dilated segment fills with urine and protrudes into the bladder. On excretory urography, cobra head sign is classically seen with an intravesical ureterocele.
