        "exp": "Pheochromocytoma must be operated on first. These tumors are generally (>50%) bilateral. Total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with MTC because of the high incidence of multicentricity, the more aggressive course, and the fact that 131I therapy usually is not effective. Central compartment nodes frequently are involved early in the disease process, so that a bilateral central neck node dissection should be routinely performed. In patients with palpable cervical nodes or involved central neck nodes, ipsilateral or bilateral, modified radical neck dissection is recommended. The role of prophylactic lateral neck dissection is controversial. However, in patients with tumors >1 cm, ipsilateral prophylactic modified radical neck dissection is recommended because >60% of these patients have nodal metastases. If ipsilateral nodes are positive, a contralateral node dissection should be performed. In the case of locally recurrent or metastatic disease, tumor debulking is advised not only to ameliorate symptoms of flushing and diarrhea, but also to decrease risk of death from recurrent central neck or mediastinal disease. External beam radiotherapy is controversial, but is recommended for patients with unresectable residual or recurrent tumor. There is no effective chemotherapy regimen. Radiofrequency ablation done laparoscopically appears promising in the palliative treatment of liver metastases >1. 5 cm. In patients who have hypercalcemia at the time of thyroidectomy, only obviously enlarged parathyroid glands should be removed. The other parathyroid glands should be preserved and marked in patients with normocalcemia, as only about 20% of patients with MEN2A develop HPT. When a normal parathyroid cannot be maintained on a vascular pedicle, it should be removed, biopsied to confirm that it is a parathyroid, and then autotransplanted to the forearm of the nondominant arm. Total thyroidectomy is indicated in RET mutation carriers once the mutation is confirmed. The procedure should be performed before age of 5 years in MEN2A patients and before age 1 year old in MEN2B patients. Central neck dissection can be avoided in children who are RET -positive and calcitonin-negative with a normal ultrasound examination. When the calcitonin is increased or the ultrasound suggests a thyroid cancer, a prophylactic central neck dissection is indicated.",

Embryologically the structures of head and neck are derived from 5 pairs of branchial arches, their intervening clefts externally and pouches internally. A tract of branchial origin may form a complete fistula, or one end may be obliterated to form an external or internal sinus, or both ends may resorb forming a cyst. 2nd branchial remnant are the most common 1st branchial remnants are typically located in front or back of the ear or in the upper neck in the region of the mandible. Fistulas typically commence through the parotid gland and end in the external auditory canal. 2nd branchial cleft remnants cause fistulas/sinuses with external opening along anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle and internal opening at the tonsillar fossa (The fistulous track passes in b/w internal & external carotid aeries) 3rd branchial cleft remnants usually do not have associated sinuses or fistulas and are located in the suprasternal notch or clavicular region. These most often contain cailage and present clinically as a firm mass or as a subcutaneous abscess. Rarely sinus may occur which open internally into pyrifon sinus. Branchiogenic anomalies occur with equal frequency on each side of the neck and 15% are bilateral. Clinical presentation - By definition, all branchial remnants are present at the time of bih although they may not become clinically evident until later in life. - Fistulas and sinus present at bih whereas cysts usually appear in late childhood and adults. - Fistulas and sinuses usually discharge a mucoid or purulent material - The cysts are characteristically found anterior and deep to the upper third of the sternocleidomastoid (interior to the angle of mandible) - Sinuses and cysts are prone to become repeatedly infected producing cellulitis and abscess formation. Treatment - Almost all branchial abnormalities should be excised early in life since repeated infection is common making resection more difficult. - Complete removal of the cyst and tract is necessary for cure and preventing recurrence. - A series of two or sometimes three small transverse incisions in a ''stepladder' fashion is preferred to a long oblique incision in the neck, which is cosmetically undesirable.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's hypertension?",
        "exp": "A pheochromocytoma is a tumor arising from chromaffin cells that secretes excess catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, or both). It is one endocrine cause of hypertension, due to peripheral vasoconstriction and/or increased cardiac output. While most patients have higher than normal baseline plasma levels of catecholamines, it is not uncommon for paroxysmal symptomatic episodes to be superimposed upon the basal problem. These \"attacks\" may occur several times a week (or more often) and last for up to 15 minutes. During an attack, respiration can increase, the patient may become aware of a forceful pounding of the hea that progresses to include a throbbing headache, and peripheral vasoconstriction can raise body temperature and lead to reflex sweating. Marked anxiety may also accompany the episode. Diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring increased plasma or urinary catecholamines or their metabolites. 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is a congenital disorder than can cause hypertension due to excessive production of the weak mineralocoicoid, deoxycoicosterone, by the inner two zones of the adrenal coex. This results in excessive renal retention of sodium and water and subsequent hypertension. While the hypertension is usually present from bih, a late-onset variant of this disorder has been described in which the symptoms do not present until late childhood or adolescence. Virilization is also present due to excessive secretion of adrenal androgens. Conn's syndrome is another endocrine cause of hypertension. In this case, the increase in blood pressure is due to excessive renal retention of sodium and water resulting from the increased plasma concentration of aldosterone. The paroxysmal symptoms and increased catecholamines present in this patient are not present with primary hyperaldosteronism. Renin-secreting tumors are rare and can be confused with primary hyperaldosteronism. The excessive secretion of renin by the tumor can increase the formation of angiotensin II with subsequent hyperaldosteronism. Sodium and water retention, together with hypokalemia, are present. Increased plasma renin and plasma aldosterone are suggestive of a renin-secreting tumor, whereas primary hyperaldosteronism would present as increased plasma aldosterone, but decreased plasma renin.

In 2001, in response to the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, OSHA revised the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. The standard requires that employees he provided: - Adequate protective equipment and clothing (gloves, face masks, aprons etc.); - Hepatitis B vaccine at no cost to the employee; - confidential medical evaluation and counseling after an incident (employees must be offered training, testing and post exposure prophylaxis at no cost); and - training on an annual basis on all aspects of bloodborne hepatitis, HIV and other bloodborne diseases (i. e., modes of transmission, effective preventive measures -- equipment, clothing and work practices, and the medical evaluation available after an exposure). Revisions to Blood Borne Pathogen standards as a result of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act: According to the revised standards the employers must keep a Sharps Injury Log for the recording of percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps. The log must documet at a minimum, the type and brand of device involved in each incident; the depament or work area in which the exposure occurred; and an explanation of how the incident happened. The information would be recorded and maintained in a way that would protect the confidentiality of injured employees. The log would serve as an impoant source of data to help determine the relative effectiveness and safety of currently used devices and to guide the development of future products.

        "exp": "Relieve of symptoms is not dependant upon sitting or other positional changes. Intermittent claudication: It refers to the pain or fatigue in muscles of the lower limb caused by walking and relieved by rest. Claudication is derived from the latin word for \"liping, lame\", strictly speaking, the term should be used only for symptoms in the lower extremities. The pain is a deep seated ache usually in the calf muscle, which gradually progressive until the patient is compelled to stop walking. Patient occasionally describe \"cramping\"or \"tiredness\"in the muscle. Typically, symptoms are completely relieved after 2-5 min of inactivity. Claudication is distinguished from other types of pain in lower extremity in that some exeion is always required before it appears; it is reproducible; it does not occur at rest; and it is relieved by cessation of walking. Relieve of symptoms is not dependant upon sitting or other positional changes. The distance a patient can walk varies with the rate of walking, the level of incline, and the degree of aerial obstruction. The average patient with involvement of a single aerial segment can walk 90-180 meters on a level terrain at a moderate pace before pain appears. Regardless of which aerial segment is involved, claudication most commonly involves the calf muscles due to their high workload with normal walking. The correct diagnosis should be easily established by determining the location of pain (calf), the quality of the pain, the length of the time required for relief of symptoms, the reproducibility of symptoms, the distance walked before symptoms begin (initial claudication distance), and the type of rest or position required for relief of symptoms. Although most patients with the disorder do not develop gangrene or require amputations, adverse outcomes of systemic atherosclerosis, including death are common. There is increasing interests in the use of the ankle- brachial index ( ABI ). Normal is >1. Claudication are in the 0. 6- 0. 9 range. with the rest pain and gangrene occurring at rest <0. 3. Indications for surgery include disabling claudication (severely limiting work or lifestyle), rest pain, limb threatening ischemia, and microembolization of the toes in which no other source is identified. Claudication distance will vary from day to day and will altered by walking up hill, and speed of walking of against the wind. Characteristically this pain is worse at night and is worsened by elevation of the extremity, whereas it is somewhat relieved by hanging the foot out of the bed or by sleeping in a chair.

The fibrous sheaths of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons are thickened where they cross the tip of the radial syloid process. The tendons themselves appear normal as does the synol lining of sheath. Exact cause is unknow. Excessive friction from overuse may be a factor, because the condition seems prone to follow repetitive actions such as wringing clothes, or in more recent times excessive typing or manipulations. The condition is five times commoner in women than men, predominantly in middle age. The main symptom is pain on using the hand, especially when movement tenses the abductor pollicis longus and extensors pollicis brevis tendons (as in lifting a saucepan or a teapot). On examination, there is local tenderness at the point where the tendons cross the radial styloid process. The thickened fibrous sheath are usually palpable as firm nodule. Passive adduction of the wrist or thumb causes the patient to wince with pain. Finkelstein's test is used to diagnose De-Quervain's tenovaginitis. To perform the test, the patients ask to flex their thumb and clench their fist over the thumb followed by ulnar detion. This produces sharp pain along the distal radius.",

Sympathetic innervation of the cutaneous structures of the breast is provided by the medial and lateral branches of the ventral ramus of 3rd to 6th intercostal nerves. While both nociceptive pain (due to damage of muscles and ligaments) and neuropathic pain can occur after surgery for breast cancer, neuropathic pain is more likely to persist after wound healing has occurred. Four pain syndromes have been distinguished 1. Phantom breast pain is a painful (often knife-like or shooting) sensation that the removed breast is still present. 2. Intercostobrachial neuralgia: usually known as post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMP). Consists of pain in the axilla, medial upper arm and anterior chest wall and is often caused by nerve damage during axillary node dissection 3. Neuroma pain: can occur from scars from either mastectomy or lumpectomy but is more common if surgery is followed by radiotherapy. 4. Other nerve injury pain: can occur even if the intercostobrachial nerve is spared and is more common in breast reconstruction and implants. In Jung et also review, there were 21 studies with follow-up periods from 1-96 months (one study of 210 months), which revealed the following widely varying ranges of prevalence estimates: Phantom breast pain 3-44 per cent Intercostobrachial neuralgia (ICN) 16-39 per cent for all breast cancer surgery; ICN in breast-conserving surgery 14-61 per cent Neuroma pain 23-49 per cent.",

Perforation may result from the resectoscope going through the bladder wall or from overdistention of the bladder with irrigation fluid. Most bladder perforations are extraperitoneal and are signaled by poor return of the irrigating fluid. Awake patients will typically complain of nausea, diaphoresis, and retropubic or lower abdominal pain. Large extraperitoneal and most intraperitoneal perforations are presenting as sudden unexplained hypotension or hypertension, and with generalized abdominal pain in awake patients. Regardless of the anesthetic technique employed, perforation should be suspected in settings of sudden hypotension or hypertension, paicularly with acute, vagally mediated bradycardia.

Hereditary angioneurotic edema is caused due to deficiency of plasma protein Ci esterase inhibitor. It is an autosomal dominant disorder. It is clinically characterized by:- Episodic edema (nonpitting) in the skin and extremities as well as in the laryngeal and intestinal mucosa provoked by emotional stress or trauma or extreme changes in temperature. Pathophysiology The mediators of edema formation in these patients are proteolytic fragments of complement C2, kinin and bradykinin. - Normally these mediators are kept in check by C1 inhibitor (CIINH) Hereditary angioneurotic edema is caused due to deficiency of the enzyme C1 inhibitor (CIINH). - (CIINH) blocks the first step in the complement pathway i. e. activation of C1. C1 complement is activated by its binding to immune complex. - CIINH prevents this activation. Thus, in the absence of CIINH there is excess of activated C1 which leads to increase in the level of activated C2. - Activated C2 mediates edema formation. Besides being inhibitor of CI, CIINH is also an inhibitor of kinin ReneratinR system. -Kining generating system includes, Hageman. factor and prekallikrein. - Activated hageman factor and prekallikrein leads to the generation of bradykinin which mediates edema formation. Normally the activation of kinin generating system is prevented by (CIINH). - In the absence of (CIINH) there is increased activation of kallikrein and. factor XII which in turn leads to increased. formation of bradykinin which produces edema. Another impoant point about hereditary angioneurotic edema is:? - It presents with angioedema without uicaria. - All patients with angioedema without uicaria should be screened with C4 level which is reduced during and between the attacks of Hereditary angioneurotic edema. One more impoant point Angioneurotic edema can also be precipitated by angiotensin conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, - It occurs due to increased level of bradykinin in the serum. - Bradykinin is degraded by an angiotensin conveing enzyme present in the lung. - ACE inhibitors blocks this enzyme leading to decreased degradation of Bradykinin.",

It is now widely accepted as an underlying intraductal carcinoma of the breast with retrograde extension into the overlying epidermis through mammary duct epithelium. Malignant epithelial (Paget) cells infiltrate and proliferate in the epidermis, causing thickening of the nipple and the areolar skin. Paget cells often express cell markers that mimic those of the underlying breast carcinoma, including glandular epithelial cell markers (ie, low-molecular-weight cytokeratins, or CAM 5. 2). They also express tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); Ca 15-3 (milk fat globule protein); some oncogenes (TP53, c-erb B-2); and other cell markers, such as epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP-15) that are found in tumor cells of ductal carcinoma of the breast.",

Discontinuation of aeria radicularis magna The Aeria Radicularis Magna (aery of Adamkiewicz) is the main source of blood supply to the anterior spinal aery in the thoracolumbar segment of the spinal cord. It arises from either one of the lower posterior intercostal aeries (T9-11), or of the subcostal aery (T12), or less frequently of the upper lumbar aeries (L1 and L2). Its occlusion or interruption is one of the major reasons for spinal cord ischemia (leading to paraparesis/paraplegia) during surgery for thoracoabdominal aneurysm. \"Clamping the descending thoracic aoa causes ischemia of the spinal cord and abdominal viscera. Clinically significant manifestations of hepatic, pancreatic, and bowel ischemia are relatively uncommon. However, both acute renal failure and spinal cord injury resulting in paraplegia or paraparesis remain major causes of morbidity and moality after these operations. \"- Schwaz 9/e p678 \"Surgery to repair thoracic and thoracoabdominal aoic aneurysms is the most common cause of spinal cord infarction. Rates of spinal cord ischemia following thoracic aoic surgery have been repoed to be as high as 29 percent, but are more usually repoed as 10 to 11 percent. Both open surgery and endovascular repair are associated with spinal cord ischemia..... Many factors may play a role in this complication. These include systemic hypotension, before, during, or after the procedure; aoic cross clamping causing decreased aerial perfusion and increased spinal canal pressure; and occlusion of impoant feeding aeries such as the aery of Adamkiewicz or other intercostal aeries either by ligation, resection, or embolization. \" - Spinal cord infarction: Vascular anatomy and etiologies Authors Michael Mullen, MD at uptodate. com \"Kieffer et al. 20 performed preoperative spinal cord aeriography in patients with thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysms, and identified the aeria radicularis magna (ARM) in 85%.

        "question": "All of the following are true regarding splenic rupture except: September 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Obliterated colonic gas shadow The most common finding associated with splenic injury is left lower rib fracture. Rib fractures signify that adequate force has been transmitted to cause splenic pathology. The classic triad indicative of acute splenic rupture (ie, left hemidiaphragm elevation, left lower lobe atelectasis, and pleural effusion) is not commonly present and should not be regarded as a reliable sign. However, any patient with apparent left hemidiaphragm elevation following blunt abdominal trauma should be considered to have splenic injury until proven otherwise. More reliable signs of Left Upper Quadrant (LUQ) injury are medial displacement of the gastric bubble and inferior displacement of the splenic flexure gas pattern. These findings are indicative of a LUQ mass and result from either suhcapsular or perisplenic hematoma. LUQ hematoma, if sufficiently large, can displace the shadow of the inferior splenic margin caudally, simulating splenomegaly. Subcapsular hematoma can produce a similar appearance, and the appreciated mass has distinct borders. Associated displacement of the left renal shadow also may be evident. The constitution of findings present when retroperitoneal hemorrhage or free intra-abdominal blood exists contrasts with those mentioned above. Little, if any, mass effect on LUQ organs is apparent. Splenic margins are obscured, but this finding is not specific. Retroperitoneal blood can obliterate the left renal outline and psoas muscle margin. Free blood pools exist dependently in the left paracolic gutter, displacing the descending colon gas pattern medially. Larger amounts of abdominal hemorrhage can obliterate the flank stripe. The small bowel gas pattern can be displaced out of the pelvis by collecting hemorrhage. A midpelvic opacity with sharp convex lateral borders may result. The bladder margin is enhanced and demarcated by a thin lucency outlining the dome and representing extra peritoneal fat.",

Thus, there is physiological conduction block without anatomic disruption. The injury is temporary and recovery is complete. It is seen in crutchpalsy, tourniquet palsy, and saturday night palsy. 2.

Although there usually is a history of resisting vomiting, in a small number of patients, the injury occurs silently, without any antecedent history. When the chest radiogram of a patient with an esophageal perforation shows air or an effusion in the pleural space, the condition is often misdiagnosed as a pneumothorax or pancreatitis. An elevated serum amylase caused by the extrusion of saliva through the perforation may fix the diagnosis of pancreatitis in the mind of an unwary physician. If the chest radiogram is normal, a mistaken diagnosis of myocardial infarction or dissecting aneurysm is often made.

Although fever and elevated peripheral white blood cell count with a left shift are usual indicators of infection, their positive predictive value for diagnosis of infectious complications in burn victims is very low because they are commonly seen in uninfected burned children whose wounds are uncovered. Neither severity of fever (frequently > 39\u00b0C) nor response to antipyretic therapy is a reliable indicator of infection. Peak fever in burned children without infection usually occurs on the second day after the burn, with a second peak around the sixth and seventh days. Fever is probably the result of an increase in metabolic rate and an alteration of hypothalamic temperature regulation. Fever usually subsides without specific therapy, coincident with re-epithelialization of the burn wound or successful grafting of all open areas. Thus, fever alone in the burned child is not a reliable indicator of infection or of the need to investigate for infection or prescribe antibiotic therapy. \"",

        "exp": "The polyostotic form typically manifests in children < 10 years of age and may progress with age. Good to know: Fibrous dysplasia: It is characterized by the replacement of normal lamellar cancellous bone by an abnormal fibrous tissue that contain small, abnormally arranged trabeculae of immature woven bone. It may affect one bone (monostotic form) or several bones (polyostotic form) The monostotic form is the most common and is usually diagnosed in patients between 20 and 30 years of age without associated skin lesions. The polyostotic form typically manifests in children Monostotic fibrous dysplasia most commonly affects the femur paicularly the femoral neck as well as the tibia and ribs. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia most commonly affects the maxilla and other craniofacial bones, ribs, and metaphyseal or diaphyseal poions of the femur or tibia. Radiological findings: In the long bones, the fibrous dysplasia lesions are typically well-defined, radiolucent areas with thin coices and a ground glass appearance. The aicular ends are usually spared. Involvement of the facial bones usually presents as radiodense lesions, which may create a leonine appearance ( leontiasis sea). Treatment: There is no established effective treatment. IV bisphosphonates therapy- improvement in bone pain and paial or complete resolution of radiographic lesions have been repoed after IV bisphosphonate therapy. Surgical stabilization is used to prevent pathologic fracture or destruction of a joint space to relieve nerve root or cranial nerve compression or sinus obstruction. Complication: Most common complication is pathological fracture Shepherd's crook deformity- if fracture occur at the femoral neck, it commonly lead to a deformity called \"shepherd crook\". Expanding bone lesions may cause pain, deformity and nerve entrapment. Sarcomatous transformation of either form of fibrous dysplasia is extremely rare, but it may occur spontaneously or, more commonly, after radiation therapy.

PUJ obstruction is the most common cause of significant dilatation of the collecting system in the fetal kidney. Incidence is more in boys (2: 1) Usually unilateral but bilateral in 10-40% of cases (I could not find 10-15% of cases, but option 'C' can be taken as correct, weighing it against option D) More common in left side Associated anomalies - Renal dysplasia Multicystic dysplastic kidney Renal agenesis (Cambell urology writes - \"Unilateral renal agenesis has been noted in almost 5% of children\") Vescico - ureteric reflux PUJ obstruction was noted in 21% of children with the VATER group of anomalies (VATER stands for vertebral defects, imperforate anus, tracheoesophageal fistula, radial and renal dysplasia) Most common presentation of cong. PUJ obstruction is asymptomatic. Cambell writes - \" Now the almost universal use of prenatal sonography has made discovery of PUJ obstruction a common occurance\" Diagnostic tools - Majority of cases are diagnosed prenatally with the help of ultrasound. Whitaker test (pressure - flow studies) can be used to find out obstruction to flow of urine, In whitaker test catheters are placed in renal pelvis and bladder. Fluid is infused into the kidney and the pressures are measured. A differential pressure between kidney and bladder could then be indicative of obstruction to the flow. Retrograde pyelography can be useful to locate the site of obstruction. Surgical repair Congenital PUJ obstruction are corrected by either-open surgical techniques or -endoscopic and laparascopic approaches Out of the 'open' techniques the Anderson- Hynes Dismembered Pyeloplasty is the most commonly employed technique.

The below given table lists the most common histologic types of adrenal incidentalomas: Causes of adrenal incidentalomas Adrenal coical tumors Cysts and pseudocysts Adenoma Hematoma and hemorrhage Nodular hyperplasia Infections, granulomas Adrenocoical carcinoma Metastases Adrenal medullary tumors Pheochromocytoma Other adrenal tumors Myelolipoma Lipoma TWO IMPOANT QUESTIONS? While evaluating an adrenal incidentaloma, two questions are asked 1. Is it malignant? If so, is it primary or metastatic cancer? 2. Is it functional (ie, is it secreting hormones)? Benign or Malignant The two major predictors of malignancy are the tumor's size and its features on imaging Size: Size is an impoant factor in differentiating benign tumors such as adrenal adenomas and hyperplasias from malignant lesions such as adrenal carcinomas and metastases from other primary sites. The larger an adrenal mass, the more likely it is malignant. However, significant overlap exists. 6 cm can be taken as the cut-off value. Features on imaging studies: The noncontrast CT attenuation coefficient On noncontrast CT if the mass has an attenuation value of < 10 HU (Hounsfield units) and is homogenous with a smooth border, it is very likely that the mass is benign. Enhancement washout is valuable in differentiating lipid-poor adrenal adenomas (noncontrast HU > 10) from nonadenomas. A CT scan with contrast is performed, the attenuation coefficent of the mass is measured 1 minute after contrast administration and again 15 minutes after contrast administration, and the percentage of enhancement washout is calculated. An absolute enhancement washout percentage of less than 60% at 15 minutes after giving contrast strongly suggests a nonadenoma. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy Cytologic study of a specimen obtained by imaging-guided fine-needle aspiration may help in evaluating an adrenal mass suspected of being metastatic that has a noncontrast CT attenuation value of more than 10 HU. It cannot, however, always differentiate an adrenocoical carcinoma from an adrenal adenoma. To avoid causing a possible hypeensive crisis, pheochromocytoma should always be excluded before fine-needle aspiration of an adrenal mass is attempted. Is it functional: About 6% to 20% of patients with adrenal incidentalomas have hormonal abnormalities, showing that the mass is functional. Patients should be evaluated for the following conditions: Pheochromocytoma Cushing syndrome (including subclinical disease) Primary aldosteronism (only if hypeensive).",

In Respiratory diseases, - The predominant mechanism for the pulmonary hypertension is an increase in resistance to pulmonary blood flow arising from perivascular parenchymal changes coupled with pulmonary vasoconstriction due to hypoxia. * In pulmonary thromboembolic disease, - Clots in pulmonary vessels increase resistance to blood flow causing pulmonary hypertension. Now about other options mentioned in the question. Alveolar hyperventilation Pulmonary hypertension is seen in Alveolar hypoventilation (not hyperventilation). In patients with alveolar hypoventilation the primary pathogenic mechanism responsible for pulmonary hypertension is alveolar hypoxia potentiated by respiratory acidosis. (alveolar hypoxia leads to constriction of pulmonary vessels). Regardless of the etiology, whether pulmonary hypeenstion will occur in patients with alveolar hypoventilation depends on whether there is sufficient alveolar and aerial hypoxia to raise pulmonary aerial pressure considerably. In sleep apnea syndrome seen in obese individuals - Severe aerial hypomexia occurs during sleep due to hypoventilation (apnea). This causes pulmonary hypertension during sleep. After some point of time, the pulmonary hypertension may continue even during the day time. Anorexiants Pulmonary hypertension has been associated with anorexiants. \"A causal relationship has been established between exposure to several anorexigens including aminorex and fenfluramine and development of pulmonary aery hypertension. \"",

        "question": "Treatment of choice for 3rd degree hemorrhoids is: September 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Hemorrhoidectomy External hemorrhoids develop around the rim of the anus. External hemorrhoids cause most of the symptoms associated with hemorrhoids (pain, burning, and itching) because the skin around them is very sensitive. If an external hemorrhoid becomes strangulated, a clot can form in it and become an excruciatingly painful thrombosed hemorrhoid. Internal hemorrhoids develop inside the passageway of the anus. Internal hemorrhoids are often present without causing any discomfo or even awareness of their presence. Internal hemorrhoids are usually painless, although they sometimes cause discomfo and bleeding if a hard stool rubs against them during a bowel movement. Internal hemorrhoids also may prolapse outside the anus, where they appear as small, grape-like masses. These can be painful. Internal hemorrhoids are classified by the degree of tissue prolapse into the anal canal: First-degree - hemorrhoids that bleed but do not prolapse Second-degree - hemorrhoids that prolapse with straining or defecating and retract on their own Third-degree - hemorrhoids that prolapse and require manual reduction Fouh-degree - hemorrhoids that chronically prolapse and, if reducible, fall out again Management: Rubber band ligation - A rubber band is placed around the base of the hemorrhoid inside the rectum. The band cuts off circulation, and the hemorrhoid withers away within a few days. Sclerotherapy is one of the oldest forms of treatment. A chemical solution is injected directly into the hemorrhoid or the area around it. This solution causes a local reaction that interferes with blood flow inside the hemorrhoid, making the hemorrhoid shrink. Laser or electro-coagulation techniques - Both techniques use special devices to burn hemorrhoidal tissue. - Cryotherapy uses cold temperatures to obliterate the veins and cause inflammation and scarring. It is more time consuming, associated with more posttreatment pain, and is less effective than other treatments. Therefore, this procedure is not commonly used. - Hemorrhoidectomy - Occasionally, extensive or severe internal or external hemorrhoid may require removal by surgery known as hemorrhoidectomy. This is the best method for permanent removal of hemorrhoid Hemorrhoidectomy is the treatment for: Severe third-degree and fouh-degree hemorrhoids. Second degree hemorrhoids that have not been cured with conservative measures. Fibrosed hemorrhoids Interno-externo hemorrhoids when the external hemorrhoid is well defined.",

It is associated with anemia of chronic disease Anemia that is often observed in patients with infectious inflammatory or neoplastic disease that persists for more than 1 or 2 months is called anemia of chronic disease. - The characteristic feature of this group is occurrence of anemia in the presence of ample storage iron. The erythrocytes in anemia of chronic disease are usually normocytic and nonnochronic, however hypochromia and microcytosis may also be observed. The morphological features are determined by the primary disease. - \"For instance many patients with cancer have anemia that is typically normocytic and normochromic. In contrast patients with long standing active rheumatoid ahritis or chronic infections such as tuberculosis will have a microc tic hypochromic anemia\". The key pathological feature in anemia of chronic disease is failure to mobilize stored irony (ferritin). Ferritin is present in the macrophages of bone marrow and reticuloendothelial system. Under normal circumstances, iron can be mobilized back from the ferritin into the circulation. When developing erythrocytes require iron, the iron stored as ferritin is presented to the plasma from where it is carried to the developing erythrocytes. Why there is failure of iron mobilization in anemia of chronic disease? Anemia of chronic disease occurs in ceain inflammatory conditions or chronic disease. In these conditions macrophages are activated and they release ceain cytokines e. g. IF, IL-1, TNF. These cytokines stimulate synthesis of hepcidin in the liver. Increased hepcidin synthesis inhibits release of iron from the storage pool. Thus in anemia of chronic diseases, the macrophages, despite being rich in stored iron cannot provide iron to developing erythrocyte. The other impoant effect of cytokines released by rnacrophages in chronic inflammatory disorders is inhibition of CFUE (colony forming units erythroid). The inhibition leads to decreased synthesis of erythropoletin which in turn decreases erythropoiesis and produces anemia.

Abnormal epididymis. Cerebral palsy. Mental retardation. Wilm's tumour. Abdominal wall defects (e. g., gastroschisis, omphalocele, prune belly syndrome). Hypospadiasis. In general, ductal abnormalities, hernias (patent processus vaginalis), and testicular maldevelopment are more common in patients with abdominal testes. Secondary sexual characters are typically normal. Overall, 32-79% of undescended testes are associated with some type of epididymal abnormality. However, abnormalities that inhibit sperm transpo (e. g., complete caput separation, atresia, agenesis) have been repoed in only 8% of patients with cryptorchidism. In addition, when the processus vaginalis is patent, the epididymis is more likely to be abnormal. Hazards of incomplete descent are: Sterility in bilateral cases (especially intra-abdominal testes). Pain as a result of trauma. An associated indirect inguinal hernia is often present. Torsion. Epididymo-orchitis in an incompletely descended right testis can mimic appendicitis.

        "exp": "Ans. C i. e. Polio Hand knee gait Extend of the paralysis in the lower limbs determines the walking ability of the patient with poliomyelitis. When one leg has a normal or nearly normal muscles power, and some residual power in the antigravity muscles (gluteus maximus, quadriceps, and triceps surae) of the other limb, the patient can walk without external suppo. If the flexion contracture develops in the knee joint of the effected limb, they often assume a hand-knee gait. Normally, the knee joint extends at heel strike, if it is unable to extend because of a weak quadriceps (unstable knee gait) or if the knee is fused in flexion, the patient will try to push it into extension with his hand. The hand-knee gait causes lurch in the limbs, which is tiring and painful. Many Patients fall down frequently and suffer injuries and fractures. Some abnormal gait patterns & causes Cerebellar - think drunk people. - Wide base/reeling on a narrow base; - Patient falls to side of lesion; - Feet raised excessively and placed down carefully. - The cerebellum deals with fine control. - Seen in any lesion of the cerebellum. - There are a whole heap of causes but these are the most impoant: CVA, alcohol, tumour, MS (multiple sclerosis) High-stepping - this is foot-drop. - Remember the \"heel-on, toe-off\" from above? - It's the opposite. - Foot doesn't dorsiflex before touching the ground. - In order to not trip over, patient need to lift it really high. - It dangles (hence \"foot-drop\") and lands toes-first. Causes include? Local: common peroneal nerve palsy, sciatic nerve palsy, distal myopathy; spine: L4, 5 root lesion; Generalised: peripheral neuropathy (alcohol, diabetes), motor neurone disease. Parkinsonian - this type of gait has a lot of specific features but the mains ones are: TRAPS- Resting tremor, Rigidity, Akinesia, Stooping posture, Shuffling gait - Mainly seen in idiopathic parkinson's disease. Sensory ataxia - broad base, bangs feet down clumsily (may have foot-drop), looks at feet throughout gait cycle. - Positive Romberg's sign.; - Generalised: peripheral neuropathy; - Spinal cord: cervical spondylosis, MS, B12/folate deficiency and bizarrely syphillis. Scissor - typical of cerebral palsy. - Walking on tip-toes (plantar flexed feet), flexed kneed, adducted and internally rotated hip, ridigity, excessive adduction in leg swing and contractures in all spastic muscles. Waddling - broad-base; duck-like waddle; - Pelvis tilts away from lifted leg; - Forward curvature of lumbar spine; and - Marked body swing. - CDH, proximal myopathy, being overweight and being pregnant Antalgic - patient leans on affected side taking rapid, heavy step. - The step on the unaffected side is slower. Usually caused by hip osteoahritis.",

        "exp": "Adriamycin based chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen depending on.... Stage I & II breast cancers (Early invasive breast cancers) are managed by 1) Primary therapy for local management & 2) Adjuvant therapy Primary therapy consists of: - Mastectomy with assessment of axillary lymph node status (or modified radical mastectomy) Or - Breast conservation (lumpectomy, wide local excision or quadrantectorny) with assessment of axillary lymph node status + radiotherapy. Various trials have found both these methods to be equally effective. Breast conservation is the preferred form of treatment because of cosmetic advantages However there are ceain contraindications for conservative surgery (described in subsequent question) Management of axillary lymph nodes Earlier dissection of axillary lymph nodes (level l and II) was performed to assess the lymph node status (i. e. presence or absence of occult metastasis) Now Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered the standard for evaluation of the axillary lymph nodes for metastasis in women who have clinically negative lymph nodes. (the sentinel lymph node is the first regional lymph node to receive tumor cells that metastasize along the lymphatic pathway from the primary breast cancer) Axiltary Lymph node dissection is performed for clinically palpable axillary lymphnodes or metastatic disease detected in sentinel lymph node biopsy. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node negative cancers if > I cm in size node negative cancer >. 5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion high nuclear grade high histological grade HER 2/neu overexpression negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive tumors. HER-2/neu expression is determined for all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and may be used to provide prognostic information in patients with node-negative breast cancer and predict the relative efficacy of various chemotherapy regimens. Trastuzumab is the HER-2/neu-targeted agent that is added to the adjuvant therapy is the tumor shows overexpression of HER-2/neu receptors. Advanced Local-Regional Breast Cancer (Stage III) (Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + MRM + adjuvant radiation therapy + chemotherapy + antiestrogen therapy) Here the disease is advanced on the chest wall or in regional lymph nodes (or both), with no evidence of metastasis to distant sites. Such patients are recognized to be at significant risk for the development of subsequent metastases, and treatment addresses the risk for both local and systemic relapse. In an effo to provide optimal local-regional disease-free survival as well as distant disease-free survival for these women, surgery is integrated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (administration of therapeutic agents prior to the main treatment) should be considered in the initial management of all patients with locally advanced stage III breast cancer. Surgical therapy for women with stage HI disease is usually a modified radical mastectomy, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Antiestrogen therapy (tamoxifen) is added for hormone receptor positive tumors. Chemotherapy is used to maximize distant disease-free survival, whereas radiation therapy is used to maximize local-regional disease-free survival. In selected patients with stage LIIA cancer, neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy can reduce the size of the primary cancer and permit breast-conserving surgery. Distant Metastases (Stage IV) (mainly palliative treatment) Treatment for stage IV breast cancer is not curative but may prolong survival and enhance a woman's quality of life. Hormonal therapies that are associated with minimal toxicity are preferred to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Appropriate candidates for initial hormonal therapy include women with hormone receptor-positive cancers: women with bone or soft tissue metastases only; and women with limited and asymptomatic visceral metastases. Systemic chemotherapy is indicated for women with hormone receptor-negative cancers, symptomatic visceral metastases, and hormone-refractory metastases. Bisphosphonates, which may be given in addition to chemotherapy or hormone therapy, should be considered in women with bone metastases. About Adjuvant Therapy Adjuvant therapy is the use of systemic therapy (chemotherapy or/and hormone therapy) in patients who have received local therapy but are at risk of relapse. The objective is to eliminate the occult metastasis responsible for late recurrences while they are microscopic and theoretically most vulnerable to anticancer agents. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node negative cancers if > 1 cm in size node negative cancer >. 5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion - high nuclear grade - high histological grade HER 2/neu overexpression negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive. The use of chemotherapy in post-menopausal women is controversial. In post menopausal women, chemotherapy is frequently used upto age 70 yrs, if she can tolerate it. In older women, chemotherapy is performed less frequently. - In estrogen positive tumors, in postmenopausal women, antiestrogen (tamoxifen/ aromatase inhibitors) therapy is the preferred form of adjuvant systemic treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy - it involves the administration of adjuvant therapy before primary therapy (surgery & radiation therapy) - it has shown to down-stage the tumor. Previously CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate & 5-fluorouracil) was the chemotherapeutic regimen of choice. \"CMF is no longer considered adequate adjuvant chemotherapy and modern regimens include an anthracycline ( doxorubicin or epirubicin) and the newer agents such as the taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel)\"- Bailey and Lore 25/e p844 Anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy (Traztuzumab) HER-2/neu expression for all newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer is now recommended. Trastuzumab is added to the chemotherapy for tumors overexpressing HER-2/nett receptors. (Traztuzumab is added along with taxanes)",

Posterior drawer test: The examiner passively displaces the humeral head in a posterior direction. Pain, clicking, or an increase in humeral translation indicate a positive test. Posterior apprehension test: The patient lies supine, with the shoulder flexed and internally rotated and with the elbow flexed and resting on the trunk. A posterior force is transmitted by the examiner through the subject's elbow. A look of apprehension and resistance to fuher movement constitute a positive result. Push - pull test: The patient is positioned supine with the shoulder placed at a 90 degree of scapular plane abduction. The examiner grasps the subject's wrist with one hand while the other hand is placed anteriorly near the humeral head. The examiner simultaneously pulls upward through the long axis of the forearm while pushing the humeral head posteriorly. A look of apprehension or displacement of the humeral head greater than 50% represent a positive test. Circumduction test: The patient is in standing position. The examiner stands behind the patient grasping the patient's forearm with the hand. The examiner begins circumduction by extending the patients arm while maintaining slight abduction. As the circumduction continues into elevation, the arm is brought over the top and into the flexed and adducted position. As the arm moves into forward flexion and adduction from above. it is vulnerable to posterior subluxation if the patient is unstable posteriorly. if the examiner palpate the posterior aspect of the patient shoulder as the arm moves downward in forward flexion and adduction, the humeral head will be felt to subluxate posteriorly in a positive test. Jahnke test: A Posteriorly directed force applied to the forward flexed shoulder. The shoulder i sthe moved into the coronal plane as an anteriorly directed force is applied to the humeral head. A clunk occur as the humeral head reduces from the subluxed position. Test for inferior shoulder instability Sulcus sign: The patient stands with the arm by the side and shoulder muscles relaxed. The examiner grasps the patient's forearm below the elbow and pulls the arm distally. a positive test suggesting inferior instability of the shoulder is indicated if patient's pain reproduced and/or a sulcus appears distal to the acromion.

        "exp": "Shunt operations are the most effective means of preventing recurrent variceal hemorrhage. Rebleeding rates after endoscopic sclerotherapy range from 40% to 60%. Although extensive esophagogastric devascularization has effectively prevented recurrent bleeding in Japanese series, these operations have been followed by rebleeding rates in excess of 25% in most Western series. Although one controlled trial has shown more frequent recurrent hemorrhage following the distal splenorenal shunt than after the poacaval shunt, most series have repoed rebleeding rates of less than 10% for both of these operations. Both the liver and the splanchnic viscera are impoant sites of ascites formation. Since the distal splenorenal shunt maintains sinusoidal and mesenteric venous hypertension and requires interruption of impoant retroperitoneal lymphatics, it tends to aggravate rather than relieve ascites. Hepatic sinusoidal pressure may be unchanged or even increased after an end- to-side poacaval shunt. Only side-to-side poal-systemic shunts, such as the side-to-side poacaval shunt, reliably decompress both the liver and splanchnic viscera, thus preventing ascites formation.",

All the above lesions are rare, so we go for the most probable choice i. e. Ant. Sacral meningocele. It appears to be the most common of all, at the given age. Some books/students would argue it to be sacrococcygeal teratoma. But points against it are: Its common age of presentation is in the newborn and infants. Most of the sacrococcygeal teratomas have external component, rarely it is entirely pelvic. Anterior sacral meningocele Anterior sacral meningocele is characterised by a defect of the anterior aspect of the sacrum involving one or more segments with herniation of the meningeal sac into the extra peritoneal pelvic region. It is more common in females than in males. The symptoms appear usually in the second to third decade of life. The symptoms of anterior sacral meningocele are primarily owing to the mechanical effects of a pelvic tumor. Occasionally minor nerve defects may be associated with the condition. - Abdominal pains, constipation, urogenital (urinary retention or incontinence), gynecological (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia) and neurological (low back pain, radiation to the legs and meningitis) symptoms may be seen. On x-ray: A unilateral sickle shape distoion of the sacral bone - The \" Scimitar sacrum\" - is considered pathognomonic. This sign is not present in all cases. Sacrococcygeal Teratoma Teratomas are tumors comprising more than a single cell type derived from more than one germ layer Teratomas range from benign, well-differentiated (mature) cystic lesions to those that are solid and malignant (immature). The most common location is sacrococcygeal (57%). Sacrococcygeal teratomas are the most common tumors in newborns. Most SCTs are found in babies and children, but SCTs have been repoed in adults. The tumors are subdivided and classified according to their location: Type I - tumors predominantly external with only minimal presacral involvement; Type II - tumors presenting externally but with a significant intrapelvic extension; Type III - tumors apparent externally but with predominant pelvic mass and extending into abdomen; Type IV - Presacral with no external presentation. A sacrococcygeal teratoma can he distinguished from its primary differential meningo-cele by its more abundant internal soft tissue, whereas the meningocele is more completely cystic in nature. Rectal duplication cyst Gastrointestinal duplications are rare congenital malformations that may vary greatly in presentation, size, location, and symptoms. The small intestine is the most frequent site involved(about 44%). Rectal duplication cysts are the rarest form of duplication comprising less than 5% of all gastrointestinal duplications. Presentation depends on the size and location of the duplication. Presenting signs of colonic or presacral duplications may include constipation, rectal bleeding, hematochezia, rectal prolapse, hemorrhoids, fistula-in-ano, and perirectal abscess.

Class ID wounds are similar except that a prosthetic device 9e. g., mesh or valve) is inseed. Clean/ contaminated wounds (class II) includes those in which a hollow viscus such as the respiratory, alimentary, or genitourinary tract with indigenous bacterial flora is opened under controlled circumstances without significant spillage of contents. Contaminated wounds (class III) include open accidental wounds encountered early after injury, those with the extensive introduction of the bacteria into a normally sterile area of the body due to major break in the sterile techniques (e. g. Open cardiac massage), gross spillage of the viscus contents such as from the intestine, or incisio through inflamed, albeit nonpurulent, tissue. Diy wounds (Class IV) include traumatic wounds in which a significant delay in treatment has occured and in which the necrotic tissue is present, those created in the presence of ove infection as evidenced by the presence of purulent material, and those created to access a perforated viscus accompanied by a high degree of contamination. The microbiology of SSIs (surgical site infections) is reflective of the initial host microflora such that SSIs following creation of class I wound are invariable, due solely to skin microbes found on that poion of te body, while SSIs subsequent to a class II wound created for the purpose of elective colon resection may be caused by either skin microbes or colonic microflora, or both.

Hydroxyethyl starch, a synthetic colloid, may help decrease hypothermia-induced cell swelling of endothelial cells and reduce interstitial edema.

Neuropathic joint (Charcoat's joint) It is a progressive destructive ahritis associated with loss of pain sensation, proprioception or both, in addition normal muscular reflexes that modulate joint movements are decreased. Without these protective mechanisms, joints are subjected to repeated trauma, resulting in progressive cailage and bone damage. It is most commonly caused by diabetes mellitus. Pathophysiology At least two underlying mechanisms are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathic ahritis. i) An abnormal autonomic nervous system is thought to be responsible for the increased blood flow to the joint and subsequent resorption of bone. ii) With the loss of deep pain, proprioception and protective neuromuscular reflexes, the joint is subjected to repeated injuries including ligamental tears and bone fractures. Pathology The pathological changes seen in charcoat's joints are similar to those found in severe osteoahritic joint. There is fragmentation and eventual loss of aicular cailage with eburnation of the underlying bone. Osteophytes are found at the joint margins. With more advanced diseases, erosions are present on the joint surface. Fractures, devitalized bone, and intraaicular loose bodies may be present. Joint effusions are prominent. Clinical manifestations Usually begins in a single joint and then progresses to involve other joints. The involved joints progressively becomes enlarged from bony overgrowth and synol effusion. o Loose bodies may be palpated in the joint cavity.",

It is characterized by three features. i) Bridging fibrous septa& in the form of delicate bands or broad scars linking poal tracts with one another and poal tracts with terminal hepatic veins. ii) Parenchymal nodulesQ containing proliferating hepatocytes encircled by fibrosis with diameters varying from very small to large. Cirrhosis is defined as micronodular or macronodular depending upon the size of parenchymal nodules Micronodular cirrhosisu - Parenchymal nodules < 3 mm in size Macronodular cirrhosisQ - Parenchymal nodules > 3 mm in size Viral hepatitis commonly causes macronodular cirrhosisdeg. In viral hepatitis the cirrhosis is characterized by irregularly large sized nodules separated by variable but mostly broad scars. This pattern of cirrhosis is historically called posnecrotic cirrhosise. Postnecrotic cirrhosis is not only applied to viral hepatitis but to all forms of cirrhosis in which the liver shows large irregular sized ntacronodules with broad scars regardless of the etiology. Also remember these Alcholic cirrhosis is typically micronodularQ, but can become macronodulare in later stages. Viral cirrhosis is typically macronodularQ. Cirrhosis associated with virus is called postnecrotic cirrhosis. Postnecrotic cirrhosis is also called posthepatitis cirrhosis macronodular cirrhosis and coarsely nodular cirrhosis. Cirrhosis in hemochromatosis is typically micronodularQ (can be macronodular sometimes). Wilson's disease causes macronodularQ cirrhosis.

The effective management of patients with these tumours requires regular imaging assessment for which CT has conventionally been the method of choice. Whilst CT remains most valuable in the initial diagnosis and staging of GISTs, it is now clear that PET imaging, preferably combined with CT, will become the gold standard method for assessment of response by viue of its unique dynamic functional characteristic which, when combined with CT, provides a more accurate assessment and prediction of the quality of response.",

This observation led to attention on environmental factors, particularly diet in the etiology of colon cancer. Dietary factors associated with colon cancers are: Animal fat diet high in animal fats such as found in red meat (beef pork, lamb) and processed meat (Sausages, hams & bacan etc.) increases the risk of colon cancer. A diet high in saturated or polyunsaturated fats increases risk of colorectal cancer, while a diet high in oleic acid (olive oil, coconut oil, fish oil) does not increase risk. consumption of fish (including fresh, canned, salted and smoked fish decrease the risk of colon cancer. This is because of the anti-cancer activity of omega-3 fatty acids found in fishes. note that consumption of chicken has no effect on colon cancer. Fibres though Harrison writes that dietary fibres play no role in colon cancer, all other books i. e. Schwartz, CSDT & Maingot's are of the view that a high fibre diet has protective effect and a low fibre diet increases the risk. Alcohol - is also a risk factor Ingestion of calcium, selenium, vitamin A, C & E, carotenoids, and plant phenols decrease the risk of colon cancer.

He initially noticed the swelling sholy after moving furniture for his new living room. He denies any nausea, vomiting, change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, or urinary tract symptoms. He has no other significant medical or surgical history. On examination, he has an enlarged right hemi-scrotum with a mass that appears to be originating at the level of the external inguinal ring. With the patient completely relaxed, the physician is able to reduce the mass by pushing it back through the external inguinal ring. With the mass reduced, the physician instructs the patient to perform a Valsalva maneuver, upon which a protrusion is felt at the external inguinal ring. Once the mass is reduced, the testicle appears normal in size and consistency. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "This patient has a reducible inguinal hernia. A hernia is a protrusion of a structure, usually intestine, through tissue that normally contains it. Inguinal hernias are either direct or indirect. Indirect inguinal hernias occur through the internal inguinal ring in a protrusion of peritoneum along the spermatic cord in the internal spermatic fascia. Direct inguinal hernias occur through the floor of the inguinal canal, separate from the spermatic cord as a result of breakdown of the transversus abdominis aponeurosis and transversalis fascia. If the mass, i. e., hernia, is easily returned back to its normal position, then it is called reducible. If the mass is not reducible, then this is called incarcerated. And, if the mass becomes incarcerated and develops compromised blood supply, it is termed strangulated. Strangulated hernias require emergent repair because the intestinal contents will necrose and cause the patient to become sick. As long as the mass is reducible, surgical repair can be performed on an outpatient basis. A hydrocele is a fluid collection contained within the tunica vaginalis that surrounds the testicle. It presents as a painless swelling of the scrotum, which transilluminates light when it is placed against the mass. A hydrocele cannot be reduced. Femoral hernias are more common in women, presenting as swellings in the upper pa of the thigh. The neck of the hernia sac lies at the femoral ring, below and lateral to the pubic tubercle, distinguishing these from inguinal hernias, which are above and medial to the tubercle. A mass caused by testicular cancer cannot be reduced either. Patients will complain of a dull, heavy, aching feeling within the testicle. The testicle itself is usually enlarged, hard, irregular, and non tender.",

The underlying pathology is neuromuscular incoordination in this region Zenker's diverticulum is a pulsion diverticulum. Esophageal Diverticula are of two types: pulsion & traction In pulsion diverticulum, increased intraluminal pressures (secondary to abnormal esophageal motility) push the mucosa and submucosa through a muscular defect in the wall of the esophagus creating a pulsion diverticulum. It's not true diverticula (not containing all the layers of the esophageal wall) In traction diverticula extraluminal forces (like inflammed & scarred peribronchial & mediastinal lymph nodes) pull the full thickness of the esophagus out, creating true diverticula. Zenker's is the most common esophageal diverticula. The diverticula arise posteriorly in the midline of the neck. The mouth of the diverticula is in the midline but the sac projects laterally (usually left laterally) Zenker's diverticula are rarely seen below 30 yrs of age, most patients are over 50. Dysphagia is the most common symptom. Undigested food is regurgitated into the mouth, especially when the patient is in the recumbent position. Swelling of the neck, gurgling noises after eating, halitosis (bad mouth odour) and a sour metallic taste in the mouth are common symptoms. Barium swallow is diagnostic Management (Maingot's 11/e chapter 8; Sabiston 18/e p1062; Schwartz 9/e p848) Surgical therapy is the treatment of choice. Methods used are: Cricopharyngeal myotomy - a myotomy alone is usually sufficient for small diverticula (<2cm). Myotomy with Diverticulopexy the larger diverticulum may be sutured in the inverted position to the prevertebral fascia using a permanent suture (i. e., diverticulopexy). Diverticulopexy avoids the complication of infection due to leak from a resected diverticulum (diverticulectomy) Myotomy with excision of sac - done for large (> 5 cm) diverticula If the diverticulum is excessively large so that it would be redundant if suspended a diverticulectomy should be performed. Diverticula-esophagostomy using a linear cutting staple gun the septum between the esophagus and the diverticula is divided also known as Dohlman procedure the advantage is that it takes less time to complete, does not require an incision, and therefore may have less morbidity. This is an important consideration since this disease most commonly presents in the elderly. This procedure is effective for diverticula >2 cm and may be impossible to perform for the small diverticulum. Sabiston writes- \" For these reasons, this technique has gained favour and is advocated in patients with diverticula between 2 and 5 cm. \"",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Primary hyperparathyroidism The initial osseous lesions associated with primary hyperparathyroidism show merely a decrease in bone density. The full blown osseous manifestations have been referred to as osteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC) or Recklinghausen's disease. Primary hyperparathvroidism (Osteitis fibrosa cystica, von recklinghausen's disease) Primary hyperparathyroidism refers to increased parathormone secretion due to primary pathology in parathyroid gland. Primary adenoma is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Rise in parathormone causes increased osteoclastic activity, which resorbs the bone. Consequently, there is increased osteoblastic activity resulting in fibrous replacement of bone and consequent weakening. Parathormone causes increased calcium absorption and increased phosphate excretion by the kidney. The net result in: - T Calcium levels Phosphate levels T Alkaline phosphatase (due to increased osteoblastic activity). Clinical features of Primary hyperparathyroidism (Osteitis fibrosa cystica) Primary hyperparathyroidism is more common in females and occurs in the third to fifth decades of life. o Clinical features are:? Bone pains: This is the most common initial feature. There is tenderness on palpating the bones, especially in the lower limbs and back. Pain is usually associated with general weakness, pallor and hypotonia. Pathological fracture: Fractures occur with tril injuries and unite in a deformed position. Common sites of fractures are dorso-lumbar spine, neck of the femur and pubic rami. Brown's tumour: This is an expansile bone lesion, a collection of osteoclasts. It commonly affects the maxilla or mandible, though any bone may be affected. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps are common presenting complaints. Occasionally, renal colics with haematuria, because of renal calculus, may occur.",

Critical aoic stenosis (choice A), is more common in boys and is associated with congestive heart failure, and a low-pitched systolic ejection murmur that can be best heard at the second right intercostal space. This murmur is different than the murmur in this case. An atrial septal defect (choice B), is a common acyanotic, left-to-right shunting cardiac anomaly. Infants with this disorder are typically asymptomatic, and it is therefore, diagnosed during a routine examination. There is a systolic ejection murmur that is heard best at the left mid to upper sternal border. There is a wide, fixed split in the second hea sound. Complications include arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure. The clinical history and findings in this case are inconsistent with this diagnosis. Patent ductus aeriosis (choice D) is usually asymptomatic if it is small. However, a wide pulse pressure, a continuous machinery murmur, apical heave, and a thrill may be present. The patent ductus allows blood to flow from the aoa directly to the pulmonary aery through the ductus aeriosis, (that should normally close by itself immediately after bih). It is typically acyanotic. Indomethacin or surgery is usually indicated to close the ductus.",

        "exp": "MCT accounts for 5-10% of thyroid cancers, 80% of tumours are sporadic, and 25% occur as a pa of an autosomal dominant hereditary syndrome ( MEN 2A or 2B). Sporadic MTC often presents in the fifth decade as a unilateral solitary nodule. Patients with familial MTC more commonly present in the fouh decade with multifocal nodules in the upper poles or both thyroid lobes, where there is the greatest concentration of the cells. The malignancies involves the parafollicular cells, or C cells, derived from the neural crests. MCT is associated with the secretion of a biologic marker, calcitonin. Excess secretion of calcitonin has been demonstrated to be an effective marker for the presence of MCT. Calcitonin excess is not associated with hypocalcemia. Histologically, MCT is an ill-defined, nonencapsulated, invasive mass composed of spindle shaped or rounded cells separated by fibrous septa and amyloid deposits. Positive immunohistochemical staining for calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and amyloid aids in the diagnosis of MTC. A patients with a sporadic medullary carcinoma may have either of two manifestations: a palpable mass for which a diagnosis can be made with FNAC or the finding of an elevated calcitonin level. family members of patient with MEN-2 ideally screened for RET proto-oncogenes. The surgical approach to sporadic medullary medullary carcinoma involves at least total thyroidectomy with or without central lymph node dissection. Total thyroidectomy allows complete removal removal of the gland and a search for multicentricity. In sporadic MTC, the lesion is generally contained within one lobe, whereas in MEN 2, the malignancy involves the upper halves of both lobes. Age > 50 years at diagnosis, metastasis at the time of diagnosis, and association with MEN 2B are associated with poor prognosis. 70% of the patients with MEN 2B have metastasis at the time of diagnosis of medullary carcinoma thyroid out of which approximately less than 50% survive up to 5 years.

Although most patients are older than 40 years at diagnosis, some lesions are detected as early as the second decade of life, particularly in patients with red or blonde hair and blue or green eyes. Males are affected about twice as often as females; however, among young patients, there is a female predilection (possibly due to tanning bed use). Approximately 80% of lesions occur on the head and neck, with the remainder involving the trunk and limbs. The most common clinicopathologic variant, nodular (nodulo-ulcerative) basal cell carcinoma, begins as a firm, painless papule that slowly enlarges and develops a central depression or umbilication. Telangiectatic blood vessels usually are evident within the rolled border surrounding the central depression. When the lesion is pressed, a characteristic pearly opalescent quality is discerned. Expanding ulceration often develops in the central depression, and the patient may show intermittent bleeding followed by healing. Untreated lesions continue to enlarge slowly with ulceration and destruction of underlying structures-hence the term rodent ulcer. Destruction of underlying bone or cartilage may occur, but metastasis is extremely rare. Ref: Oral pathology Neville, 4th ed page no 397",
