        "exp": "Ans is d i. e Anterior sacral meningocele Well all 4 options can present as presacral mass and any large pelvic mass can cause constipation and urinary retention due to mass effect. All the above lesions are rare, so we go for the most probable choice i. e. Ant. Sacral meningocele. It appears to be the most common of all, at the given age. Some books/students would argue it to be sacrococcygeal teratoma. But points against it are: Its common age of presentation is in the newborn and infants. Most of the sacrococcygeal teratomas have external component, rarely it is entirely pelvic. Anterior sacral meningocele Anterior sacral meningocele is characterised by a defect of the anterior aspect of the sacrum involving one or more segments with herniation of the meningeal sac into the extra peritoneal pelvic region. It is more common in females than in males. The symptoms appear usually in the second to third decade of life. The symptoms of anterior sacral meningocele are primarily owing to the mechanical effects of a pelvic tumor. Occasionally minor nerve defects may be associated with the condition. - Abdominal pains, constipation, urogenital (urinary retention or incontinence), gynecological (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia) and neurological (low back pain, radiation to the legs and meningitis) symptoms may be seen. On x-ray: A unilateral sickle shape distoion of the sacral bone - The \" Scimitar sacrum\" - is considered pathognomonic. This sign is not present in all cases. Sacrococcygeal Teratoma Teratomas are tumors comprising more than a single cell type derived from more than one germ layer Teratomas range from benign, well-differentiated (mature) cystic lesions to those that are solid and malignant (immature). The most common location is sacrococcygeal (57%). Sacrococcygeal teratomas are the most common tumors in newborns. Most SCTs are found in babies and children, but SCTs have been repoed in adults. The tumors are subdivided and classified according to their location: Type I - tumors predominantly external with only minimal presacral involvement; Type II - tumors presenting externally but with a significant intrapelvic extension; Type III - tumors apparent externally but with predominant pelvic mass and extending into abdomen; Type IV - Presacral with no external presentation. A sacrococcygeal teratoma can he distinguished from its primary differential meningo-cele by its more abundant internal soft tissue, whereas the meningocele is more completely cystic in nature. Rectal duplication cyst Gastrointestinal duplications are rare congenital malformations that may vary greatly in presentation, size, location, and symptoms. The small intestine is the most frequent site involved(about 44%). Rectal duplication cysts are the rarest form of duplication comprising less than 5% of all gastrointestinal duplications. Presentation depends on the size and location of the duplication. Presenting signs of colonic or presacral duplications may include constipation, rectal bleeding, hematochezia, rectal prolapse, hemorrhoids, fistula-in-ano, and perirectal abscess.

In light of the seasonal variation, with a peak incidence in spring and summer, it may be related to upper respiratory tract infection pathogens such as adenovirus or rotavirus. \" Intussusception associated with a known pathologic lead point is seen in older children.

Neuropathic joint (Charcoat's joint) It is a progressive destructive ahritis associated with loss of pain sensation, proprioception or both, in addition normal muscular reflexes that modulate joint movements are decreased. Without these protective mechanisms, joints are subjected to repeated trauma, resulting in progressive cailage and bone damage. It is most commonly caused by diabetes mellitus. Pathophysiology At least two underlying mechanisms are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathic ahritis. i) An abnormal autonomic nervous system is thought to be responsible for the increased blood flow to the joint and subsequent resorption of bone. ii) With the loss of deep pain, proprioception and protective neuromuscular reflexes, the joint is subjected to repeated injuries including ligamental tears and bone fractures. Pathology The pathological changes seen in charcoat's joints are similar to those found in severe osteoahritic joint. There is fragmentation and eventual loss of aicular cailage with eburnation of the underlying bone. Osteophytes are found at the joint margins. With more advanced diseases, erosions are present on the joint surface. Fractures, devitalized bone, and intraaicular loose bodies may be present. Joint effusions are prominent. Clinical manifestations Usually begins in a single joint and then progresses to involve other joints.

This observation led to attention on environmental factors, particularly diet in the etiology of colon cancer. Dietary factors associated with colon cancers are: Animal fat diet high in animal fats such as found in red meat (beef pork, lamb) and processed meat (Sausages, hams & bacan etc.) increases the risk of colon cancer. A diet high in saturated or polyunsaturated fats increases risk of colorectal cancer, while a diet high in oleic acid (olive oil, coconut oil, fish oil) does not increase risk. consumption of fish (including fresh, canned, salted and smoked fish decrease the risk of colon cancer. This is because of the anti-cancer activity of omega-3 fatty acids found in fishes. note that consumption of chicken has no effect on colon cancer. Fibres though Harrison writes that dietary fibres play no role in colon cancer, all other books i. e. Schwartz, CSDT & Maingot's are of the view that a high fibre diet has protective effect and a low fibre diet increases the risk. Alcohol - is also a risk factor Ingestion of calcium, selenium, vitamin A, C & E, carotenoids, and plant phenols decrease the risk of colon cancer.

The full blown osseous manifestations have been referred to as osteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC) or Recklinghausen's disease. Primary hyperparathvroidism (Osteitis fibrosa cystica, von recklinghausen's disease) Primary hyperparathyroidism refers to increased parathormone secretion due to primary pathology in parathyroid gland. Primary adenoma is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Rise in parathormone causes increased osteoclastic activity, which resorbs the bone. Consequently, there is increased osteoblastic activity resulting in fibrous replacement of bone and consequent weakening. Parathormone causes increased calcium absorption and increased phosphate excretion by the kidney. The net result in: - T Calcium levels Phosphate levels T Alkaline phosphatase (due to increased osteoblastic activity). Clinical features of Primary hyperparathyroidism (Osteitis fibrosa cystica) Primary hyperparathyroidism is more common in females and occurs in the third to fifth decades of life. o Clinical features are:? Bone pains: This is the most common initial feature. There is tenderness on palpating the bones, especially in the lower limbs and back. Pain is usually associated with general weakness, pallor and hypotonia. Pathological fracture: Fractures occur with tril injuries and unite in a deformed position. Common sites of fractures are dorso-lumbar spine, neck of the femur and pubic rami. Brown's tumour: This is an expansile bone lesion, a collection of osteoclasts. It commonly affects the maxilla or mandible, though any bone may be affected. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps are common presenting complaints.

Types: (a) Spontaneous pheumothorax ---> is one that occurs without antecedant trauma to the thorax (i) Primary spontaneous - Occurs in the absence of an underlying lung disease (usually d/t apical plural blebs). (ii) Secondary spontaneous - d/t an underlying lung disease. (b) Traumatic pneumothorax --) results from penetrating or non penetrating injuries to the chest. (c) Tension pheumothorax Any pneumothorax in which the pressure in the pleural space is positive throughout the respiratory cycle. In this pt. its not specified the type of spontaneous pneumothorax; still let's see the t/t Treatment Primary spontaneous pneumothorax? Initial recommended treatment is simple aspiration If the lung does not expand with aspiration, or if the pt. has a recurrent pneumothorax, thoracoscopy with stapling of blebs and pleural abrasion is indicated (100% success rate) Secondary Spontaneous pneumothorax Sec. spon. pneumothorax can occur in any lung ds but are commonly seen in COPD. Nearly all pts are t/t with tube thoracostomy and the instillation of a sclerosing agent such as doxycycline or talc. - Pts. with persitent air leak, an unexpanded lung after 3 days of tube thoracostomy, or a recurrent pneumothorax should be subjected to thoracoscpy with bleb resection and plueral abrasion. Traumatic pneumothorax Traumatic pneumothorax should be t/t with tube thoracostomy unless they are very small. If a hemopneumothorax is present, one chest tube should be placed in the superior pa of the hemithorax to evacuate the air, and another should be placed in the inferior pa of the hemithorax to remove the blood. Tension pneumothorax - It is an emergency situation. A large bore needle is inseed into the pleural space through the Second anterior intercostal space. The needle should be left in place until a thoracostomy tube is inseed. I assume that the pt. has primary spontaneous pneumothorax as there is no past history of any disease (as it is not mentioned in the question).",

Although most patients are older than 40 years at diagnosis, some lesions are detected as early as the second decade of life, particularly in patients with red or blonde hair and blue or green eyes. Males are affected about twice as often as females; however, among young patients, there is a female predilection (possibly due to tanning bed use). Approximately 80% of lesions occur on the head and neck, with the remainder involving the trunk and limbs. The most common clinicopathologic variant, nodular (nodulo-ulcerative) basal cell carcinoma, begins as a firm, painless papule that slowly enlarges and develops a central depression or umbilication. Telangiectatic blood vessels usually are evident within the rolled border surrounding the central depression. When the lesion is pressed, a characteristic pearly opalescent quality is discerned. Expanding ulceration often develops in the central depression, and the patient may show intermittent bleeding followed by healing. Untreated lesions continue to enlarge slowly with ulceration and destruction of underlying structures-hence the term rodent ulcer. Destruction of underlying bone or cartilage may occur, but metastasis is extremely rare. Ref: Oral pathology Neville, 4th ed page no 397",

        "exp": "\"Surgery should be recommended for patients who continue to be bothered by their symptoms or who experience urinary retention despite medical therapy. Surgery should also be recommended for patients with upper tract dilation, renal insufficiency secondary to BPH, or bladder stones. \"- Schwartz 8/e p1. 530 About other options: Prostate Size: Treatment of BPH is primarily dictated by patient's symptoms and not by the prostate size. However the size of prostate can decide whether to go for endoscopic method of treatment or open surgical procedure. Open surgery is more effective than endoscopic methods for prostates weighing >100gm (ref: Schwartz 9/e p1471; Smith's Urology I7/e p. 3. 54) UTI: Recurrent episodes of UTI (and not a single episode) are an absolute indication for surgery of prostate. Hypertension: Alpha blockers which are first line medical therapy for BPH lower the blood pressure and thus are helpful in hypertensive persons. Management of BPH Management is primarily directed by symptoms. Mild symptoms can be managed with watchful waiting. More severe symptomatic patients are treated with medicines (alpha blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors or combination of both). Surgery is recommended if the patient is having problems despite medical therapy. Absolute indications for surgery as listed in Smith's Urology is given below. Absolute indications for surgical treatment of BPH Refractory urine retention (failing at least one attempt at catheter removal) Recurrent UTI from BPH Bladder stones d/t BPH Renal insufficiency d/t BPH Large bladder diverticula secondary to BPH Recurrent gross hematuria from BPH Upper tract dilatation is an indication for surgery according to Schwartz. Medical therapy Alpha-blockers (terazosin, doxazosin, and tamsulosin) Alpha-blockers help is reducing the symptoms of BPH by blocking the alpha 1 adrenoreceptors present in human prostate and bladder base. 5-Alpha-reductase inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride) - 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. This thus results in reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptoms (after several months of use). Surgery Surgery for BPH is most commonly performed endoscopically; however, if the prostate gland is quite large (approx >100 g), an open prostatectomy should be performed. The standard endoscopic procedure for BPH is a transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate. Conventional surgical methods: Transurethral resection of the prostate (most commonly used method) Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) Open simple prostatectomy (simple suprapubic prostatectomy, simple retropubic prostatectomy) - When the prostate is too large to be removed endoscopically, an open enucleation is necessary. What constitutes \"too large\" is subjective and varies depending upon the surgeon's experience with TURP. Glands >100 g are usually considered for open enucleation. Open prostatectomy may also be initiated when concomitant bladder diverticulum or a bladder stone is present or if dorsal lithotomy positioning is not possible. Open prostatectomies can be done with either a suprapubic or retropubic approach. A simple suprapubic prostatectomy is performed transvesically and is the operation of choice in dealing with concomitant bladder pathology. Minimally invasive methods: Laser therapy (Nd: YAG and holmium: YAG ) Transurethral electro vaporization of the prostate Microwave Hyperthermia Transurethral needle ablation of the prostate- High-intensity focused ultrasound for thermal tissue ablation Intraurethral stents-stents are endoscopically placed in the prostatic fossa and are designed to keep the prostatic urethra patent. They are usually covered by urothelium within 4-6 months after insertion. These devices are typically used for patients with limited life expectancy who are not deemed to be appropriate candidates for surgery or anesthesia.",

D: 3 The Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS, also known as the Glasgow Coma Score is a neurological scale which aims to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person, for initial as well as continuing assessment. The scale comprises three tests: eye, verbal and motor responses. The three values separately as well as their sum are considered. The lowest possible GCS is 3 (deep coma or death), while the highest is 15 (fully awake person). Best eye response (E) There are 4 grades staing with the most severe: No eye opening - Eye opening in response to pain. (Patient responds to pressure on the patient's fingernail bed; if this does not elicit a response, supraorbital and sternal pressure or rub may be used.) - Eye opening to speech. (Not to be confused with an awaking of a sleeping person; such patients receive a score of 4, not 3.) - Eyes opening spontaneously Best verbal response (V) There are 5 grades staing with the most severe: - No verbal response - Incomprehensible sounds. (Moaning but no words.) - Inappropriate words. (Random or exclamatory aiculated speech, but no conversational exchange) - Confused. (The patient responds to questions coherently but there is some disorientation and confusion.) Oriented. (Patient responds coherently and appropriately to questions such as the patient's name and age, where they are and why, the year, month, etc.) Best motor response (M) There are 6 grades staing with the most severe: - No motor response - Extension to pain (adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm, extension of wrist, decerebrate response) - Abnormal flexion to pain (adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm, flexion of wrist, decoicate response) - Flexion/ Withdrawal to pain (flexion of elbow, supination of forearm, flexion of wrist when supra-orbital pressure applied; pulls pa of body away when nailbed pinched) - Localizes to pain. (Purposeful movements towards painful stimuli; e. g., hand crosses mid-line and gets above clavicle when supra-orbital pressure applied.) Obeys commands. (The patient does simple things as asked.)

        "exp": "Hepatic failure occurring in cirrhosis reduces the capacity of the liver to synthesize sufficient quantities of plasma proteins (mostly albumin) necessary to maintain plasma oncotic pressure. Low plasma oncotic pressure allows fluid from the intravascular fluid component to move into the interstitial space, producing plasma volume contraction and edema. Lymphatic obstruction occurs as a result of mechanical blockage of lymphatics by tumor, inflammatory processes, or ceain parasitic infections. Cirrhosis does not lead to lymphatic obstruction. Reduced central venous pressure does not cause edema. Conversely, increased central venous pressure, which may arise with congestive heart failure, thrombosis, or cirrhosis can lead to increased hydrostatic pressure and edema. Sodium retention is an impoant cause of edema in patients with poor renal perfusion. The kidneys respond by retaining sodium and increasing plasma volume in an effo to increase renal blood flow. Sodium retention in cirrhosis is secondary to the decrease in plasma oncotic pressure and consequent decrease in plasma volume. Ref: Geller D. A., Goss J. A., Tsung A. (2010). Chapter 31. Liver.

        "exp": "Carotid duplex scan Neurocardiogenic syncope is also called vasovagal syncope or vasodepressor syncope. It is considered to be an abnormality in the complex neurocardiovascular interactions responsible for maintaining systemic and cerebral perfusion. Under normal circumstances, upright posture causes venoul polling and a transient decrease in aerial pressure, resulting in unloading of baroreceptors. Reflex augumentation of sympathetic activity and parasympathetic withdrawl results in peripheral aerial vasoconstriction, venoconstriction and an increase in heart rate and contractility. These adaptive mechanisms serve to maintain normal systemic and cerebral perfusion. Individuals susceptible to neurocardiogenic syncope are unable to maintain the adaptive neurocardiovascular response to upright posture for prolonged periods. In these patients due to incompletely understood mechanisms the cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors are stimulated resulting in increased neural stimulus to vasomotor centre. This results in reflex paradoxical vasodilation and bradycardia. The final result is hypotension, cerebral hypopeifusion, cerebral hypoxia and syncope. Diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope: Tilt table study It is used to evaluate patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. In a tilt table study the patient is strapped to a table which is then mechanically tilted to an upright position. While monitoring the pulse, blood pressure, electrocardiogram and sometimes blood oxygen saturation, the patient is left in a 'motionless standing position' for 20 to 30 minutes. When the patient's syncope is reproduced during the test a \"positive\" tilt table study is said to have occurred. During an upright tilt, a patient's cardiovascular system has to adjust itself in order to prevent a significant poion of the blood volume from pooling in the legs. These adjustments consists of a mild increase in heart rate and a constriction of blood vessels in the legs. When a normal individual is placed in an upright tilt, these cardiovascular adjustments occur very quickly, and there is no significant drop in the blood pressure. However, in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, these adjustments do not occur. Carotid sinus massage In patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, the symptoms can be elicited by carotid sinus massage. Ohostatic blood pressure recording Supine and upright blood pressure monitoring should be done in all patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. Carotid duplex scan Carotid duplex scan is a non-invasive study to estimate the presence and severity of carotid narrowing due to atherosclerosis. In neurocardiogenic syncope, no organic cause is present, so carotid duplex scan has no role.",

Most of the serological tests used in the diagnosis of syphilis cannot accurately diagnosis neurosyphilis. Hence, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis usually depends on combination of clinical features plus C. S. F. finding and serological tests. C. S. F. findings in syphilis:? - Lymphocytic pleocytosis - Protein is moderately elevated - Glucose is usually normal Among the serological tests - \"The VDRL C. S. F. test is the standard serological test for C. S. F. and is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis\". -Since invasion of C. S. F by syphilis stimulates production of antilipoidal antibodies in C. S. F.. VDRL test can be performed on C. S. F. to diagnose neurosyphilis. - The VDRL test is highly specific albeit insensitive for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. - The sensitivity of VDRL*for neurosyphilis is 30% and specificity is 90%. Specific treponemol tests have proved to be quite inaccurate in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis Why??? - The antibodies against the specific treponemal antigen have the tendency to cross C. S. F., so enough antibodies may be present in the C. S. F. even before neurosyphilis develops. - Therefore specific treponemal tests have no specificity for neurosyphilis. The CS. F. becomes positive for these tests even when neurosyphilis is not present. Moreover, Specific treponemal tests cannot be used to monitor treatment because? - These tests become positive soon after infection and typically remain positive. for life despite adequate treatment. An impoant point - Like VDRL test RPR test can also be used to monitor the treatment in syphilis but it is not suitable for testing C. S. F., so it cannot he used in neurosyphilis.

She is experiencing good fetal movement and has had no loss of fluid, bleeding from the vagina, or contractions. She has no complaints. Her past medical history is significant for mitral stenosis, which she developed after an episode of rheumatic fever as a child. She also has asthma for which she uses an albuterol inhaler daily. She has herpes outbreaks approximately once a year. At her last visit she was found to be positive for Group B Streptococcus colonization. For which of the following disease processes would this patient benefit by having a forceps-assisted vaginal delivery at the time of delivery?",
        "exp": "Ans: D.). Mitral Stenosis. Mitral valve stenosis is one of the more common valvular lesions seen in pregnancy. The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic endocarditis. During normal pregnancy there is an increase in the cardiac output and an increase in preload and circulating volume. Patients with mitral stenosis have a fixed, decreased valve area, which places them at risk for the development of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary edemA. Control of arrhythmias is absolutely essential in these patients because they are at increased risk, given the left atrial enlargement that often goes along with their mitral stenosis. Labor and delivery can be a paicularly dangerous time for these patients. Therefore, patients with significant mitral stenosis should be monitored invasively using a Swan-Ganz catheter. It is recommended that the second stage of labor be shoened using forceps or vacuum to prevent excess maternal Valsalva effos and maternal tachycardia. Asthma ( Choice A)is not an indication for forceps-assisted vaginal delivery. In terms of mode of delivery, asthmatic patients may be managed like any other patient in the second stage of labor. Group B Streptococcus colonization (Choice B) is an indication for intravenous penicillin or clindamycin (if the patient has an allergy to penicillin). These antibiotics are given to prevent GBS sepsis in the neonate. GBS colonization is not an indication for forceps-assisted vaginal delivery. Herpes (Choice C) can be transmitted to the fetus at the time of delivery. Therefore, when lesions are present in the bih canal, most obstetricians recommend cesarean delivery.",

Many cases of acute pancreatitis are comparatively mild, but severe cases can cause life-threatening shock secondary to release of vasoactive substances from the damaged pancreas that is difficult to treat. Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed by demonstrating elevated serum amylase levels. Antinuclear antibodies are present in a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. IgG levels are not affected by acute pancreatitis. The reticulocyte count is an index of bone marrow function that is used to evaluate the etiologies of some anemias. Ref: Fisher W. E., Anderson D.

        "exp": "Apoptosis is a form of cell death that serves to eliminate unwanted cells during development, maintain cell numbers in intact organs or tissues, and eliminate immune cells after an immune response has faded. Apoptosis also occurs in response to noxious agents and in the aging process. The process is the result of execution of an internal program mediated by the expression of a number of different genes. In the process of apoptosis, cells shrink and cytoplasmic organelles become more densely packed. Cytoplasmic blebs may form, and apoptotic bodies (membrane-bound cellular fragments) can be produced. The most characteristic feature of apoptosis is a distinctive peripheral aggregation of chromatin, sometimes accompanied by breaking up of the nucleus into several fragments. In necrosis, the chromatin may become more pale (karyolysis), or form irregular clumps, and the nucleus itself may shrink into a dense pyknotic body. Disaggregation of polyribosomes is characteristic of the initial stages of cellular injury and necrosis. Eosinophilia characterizes both apoptosis and necrosis. Inflammation is typically absent in apoptosis, in contrast to necrosis. Ref: Jan B. V., Lowry S. F. (2010). Chapter 2. Systemic Response to Injury and Metabolic Suppo. In F. C. Brunicardi, D. K.

Characteristics of Bronchogenic Cysts - Most of the Bronchogenic cysts arise in the mediastinum but ~15% occur in pulmonary parenchyma. In the mediastinum, they are usually located just posterior to the carnia or main stem bronchi. Mediastinal bronchogenic cysts do not communicate with the bronchi but those situated within the lung may communicate with the airways and consequently are prone to abscess formation. When located in the lung, they are more common in right lung and lower lobes These are lined by cuboidal or ciliated columnar epithelium and are usually filled with mucoid material. Complication: - Infection of the cyst leads to abscess Compression can produce either hyper infection of the lung or atelectasis due to obstruction Tension pneumothorax -> d/t Rupture of the cyst that communicates with bronchus.",

Most common complications of intracapsular fracture neck femur are nonunioin & fixation failure (more common in most series of displaced fractures) and avascular necrosis (more common in most series of undisplaced fractures). Shoening is seen in almost all cases of nonunion & AVN. Chances of avascular necrosis (AVN) and nonunion increases as the fracture site becomes more proximal Q. The more proximal the fracture located the worse the prognosis.

The probable causes of nonunion in fracture neck femur are - - Cambium layer of periosteum which produce callus is missing. There fore femoral neck must heal direct endosteal healing only. There is no contact with soft tissues which could promote callus formation. Precarious blood supply: by tearing the ascending cervical branches or retinacular vessels the injury deprives head of its main blood supplyQ. Synol fluid interfere with fracture healing as it prevents clotting of fracture hematoma and release angiogenic inhibiting factors. - Inadequate reduction and improper immobilization. * It is impoant to note that avascular necrosis and nonunion are independent events, because AVN is based on vascular supply of femoral head, whereas nonunion is based on the healing process. So AVN can occur even in united fractures. * Femoral neck fractures should unite by 6 months. If there is no evidence of healing or patient continued to have pain at 3 - 6 months after surgery then a delayed (3 months) or non union ( 6 months) should be contemplated. * AVN is a late complication and ischemic collapse usually occur with in 2 -years of fracture. According to anatomical location of fracture neck femur the chances of AVN & nonunion in decreasing order are: subcapital (transepiphyseal in children) > TranscervicalQ > Basicervical. - Temponade effect of intracapsular hematoma causing floating of both fracture ends and making reduction difficult.",

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "This is the typical clinical presentation of carcinoma of the prostate, which is probably the most frequent cancer in males (although lung cancer is the most frequent neoplastic cause of death). Autopsy studies show that small foci of adenocarcinoma are found in the prostate of up to 70% of men older than 80. Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) is expressed by both normal prostatic tissue and adenocarcinoma of the prostate. A rise in PSA plasma levels, therefore, simply results from any increase in the mass of prostatic tissue and cannot be used to differentiate between cancer and hyperplasia. Cancer arises more frequently in the peripheral zone of the gland, producing firm nodules on the posterior surface that can be detected on rectal examination. Metastasis to the bone can be osteoblastic (with formation of new bone) or osteolytic (with destruction of bone). Osteoblastic metastases in the veebral column are characteristic of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Chronic prostatitis presents with dysuria and perineal discomfo. The diagnosis relies on finding at least 10 leukocytes per high-power field on microscopic examination of expressed prostatic secretions. Chronic prostatitis is fuher classified into bacterial prostatitis if cultures are positive for bacteria, or abacterial prostatitis if cultures are negative. Increased plasma PSA is frequently seen. Multiple myeloma is a neoplasm of plasma cells that frequently manifests with osteolytic (not osteoblastic) lesions in the veebral column as well as other bones, such as the cranial vault and ribs. Prostatic hyperplasia is an extremely common disorder in middle-aged and elderly men. It involves the periurethral zone of the gland, leading to compression of the urethra, difficulty in urination, urinary retention, and recurrent cystitis. PSA levels are increased in a manner roughly propoional to the degree of prostatic enlargement. Ref: La Rochelle J., Shuch B., Belldegrun A. (2010). Chapter 40. Urology. In F. C. Brunicardi, D. K.

Traditionally, BE was identified by the presence of columnar mucosa extending at least 3 cm into the esophagus. It is now recognized that the specialized intestinal type epithelium found in the Barrett's mucosa is the only tissue predisposed to malignant degeneration. Consequently, the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is presently made given any length of endoscopically identifiable columnar mucosa that proves on biopsy to show intestinal metaplasia. While long segments of columnar mucosa without metaplasia do occur, they are uncommon and are probably congenital in origin.

No distinct benefit from the use of colloids have been demonstrated and in trauma patients, it is associated with a higher moality. The infusion of 2 to 3 lt. over 20 to 30 min should restore normal hemodynamic parameters. Continued hemodynamic instability implies that shock has not been reversed and/or that there are significant ongoing blood or volume losses. Continued blood loss, with hemoglobin concentration declining to 10 g/dl should initiate blood transfusion. In the presence of severe and for prolonged hypovolemia, inotropic suppo with dopamine vasopressin or dobutamine may be required to maintain adequate ventricular performance, after blood volume has been restored. Infusion of norepinephrine to increase aerial pressure by raising peripheral resistance is inappropriate, other than as a temporizing measure in severe shock while blood volume is reexpanded. \"",

Significant amounts of fluid may be absorbed during a TURP, especially if venous sinuses are opened early or when the operation is prolonged. On average during a TURP, approximately 20 mL of fluid per minute is absorbed, or approximately 1000-1200 mL in the first hour of resecting time. One third of this fluid is absorbed directly into the venous system. This may lead to dilutional hyponatremia (TUR syndrome), which causes mental confusion, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, hemolysis, hemoglobin nephropathy, coma, and shock. Symptoms of TUR syndrome generally do not occur until the serum sodium level has decreased to 125 m. Eq or less. There will be clonus and positive Babinski responses. Papilloedema, with dilated, sluggishly reacting pupils can occur. The EEG will show low voltage, bilaterally. Hemodynamically, this is characterized initially by increased central venous pressures, hypertension, bradycardia, and other signs of early vascular overload, including restlessness, tachypnea, and sometimes dusky skin changes of the conjunctiva, mucous membranes, or fingernails.

Neveheless, the similarities between gout and pseudogout require aspiration of the joint for diagnosis. Negatively-birefringent needle-shaped crystals are diagnostic for gout. The other choices are not diagnostic or commonly occurring combinations.

Diagnosis of myaesthenia gravis Several special diagnostic Tests for mysthenia gravis Electrophysiological Testing: (Repetitive nerve stimulation test) * Characteristic of myasthenia on electrophysiological testing is rapid reduction in the amplitude of muscle action potentials evoked during a series of repetitive stimulations of a peripheral nerve at a rate of 3 per second (decrementing response) * The traditional and simple method is to stimulate the nerve at 3 Hz and to measure the compound muscle action potential (a decrement of more than 10% when comparing the fifth to the first response is abnormal) Single fibre electromyography * This is more sensitive but technically more difficult than electrophysiological testing * Confirmatory but not specific. * This technique demonstrates an inconstancy in the firing of fibres connected to the same motor unit or a blocking of successive discharges from single muscle fibre belonging to the same motor unit. Edrophonium and Neostigmine test/Tensilon test * When edrophonium and neostigmine are given intravenously, it produces a transient improvement in strength in patients with myasthenia. * Edrophonium and neostigmine are anti cholinesterase so they prolong and exaggerate the effect of acetylcholine in the synapse and therefore provide an increment in muscle power in patient with myasthenia, * It is highly sensitive with 85%2 sensitivity in ocular and 95%e sensitivity in systemic myaesthenia. Measurement of receptor antibodies in the blood:... * * Measurement of antiacetylclzoline receptor antibodies provides a sensitive and highly specific test for the diagnosis of myasthenia. Presence of Ach antibodies is viually diagnostic of Myaesthenia graves. * Sensitivity is limited to about 50% in purely occular myasthenia and about 85% in generalized myasthenia. * Definitive if positive but negative test does not rules out the diagnosisdeg. The question has specifically asked which test would be most useful \"to diagnose\" myaesthenia gravis. The electrophysiological tests such as EMG and repetitive nerve stimulation test are quite sensitive test used for the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, but they are not diagnostic. Abnormality in these tests denotes some defect in neuromuscular conduction. It does not mean that these neuromuscular conduction defects are due to myasthenia gravis. Edrophonium test is more diagnostic than electrophysiological test for the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.

The goal is eradication of micrometastatic disease, with the intent of preventing recurrances. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy - Neoadjuvant therapy, in contrast to adjuvant chemotherapy, is given before surgery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used as the primary treatment in patients who present with localized cancer for which local therapies, such as surgery and/or radiation, exist but are less than completely effective. One of the major advantages of neoadjuvant therapy is to reduce the size of the primary tumor such that it allows the surgeon a better chance of complete resection while reducing the potential spread of micrometastatic spread. Moreover, in the case of laryngeal cancer, anal cancer, osteosarcoma, and bladder cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may allow for preservation of vital organs such as the larynx, anal sphincter, limbs, and bladder, respectively.",

If this fails to relieve symptoms, simple neuroma excision or a more proximal neurectomy may be required and the severed nerve is replaced into healthy tissue. Some authors recommended neuroma excision combined with centrocentral anastomosis of the proximal stump or a procedure to seal the epineural sleeve. Phantom limb pain, although rarely when is significant, can be extremely difficult to treat. More that 50 different methods of treatment are in use. Although no one specific method is universally beneficial, some patient may benefit from such diverse measures as massage, ice, heat, increased prosthetic use, relaxation training, biofeed back, sympathetic blockade, local nerve block, epidural block, ultrasound, trans cutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS), placement of dorsal column stimulator, interferential therapy, and acupuncture etc.",

It is believed that hyperplasia of Peyer's patches in the terminal ileum may be the initiating event. This may occur secondary to weaning. In light of the seasonal variation, with peak incidence in spring and summer, it may be related to upper respiratory tract infection pathogens such as adenovirus or rotavirus. \"Intussusception associated with a known pathologic lead point is seen in older children.

        "exp": "When deep second- and third-degree burn wounds encompass the circumference of an extremity, peripheral circulation to the limb can be compromised. Development of generalized edema beneath a nonyielding eschar impedes venous outflow and eventually affects aerial inflow to the distal beds. This can be recognized by numbness and tingling in the limb and increased pain in the digits. Aerial flow can be assessed by determination of Doppler signals in the digital aeries and the palmar and plantar arches in affected extremities. Capillary refill can also be assessed. Extremities at risk are identified either on clinical examination or on measurement of tissue pressures greater than 40 mm Hg. These extremities require escharotomies, which are releases of the burn eschar performed at the bedside by incising the lateral and medial aspects of the extremity with a scalpel or electrocautery unit. The entire constricting eschar must be incised longitudinally to completely relieve the impediment to blood flow. The incisions are carried down onto the thenar and hypothenar eminences and along the dorsolateral sides of the digits to completely open the hand, if it is involved. If it is clear that the wound will require excision and grafting because of its depth, escharotomies are safest to restore perfusion to the underlying non burned tissues until formal excision.

D: Anterior and posterior tibial aery Buerger disease, a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease also known as thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), is characterized by the absence or minimal presence of atheromas, segmental vascular inflammation, vasoocclusive phenomenon, and involvement of small and medium-sized aeries (plantar, tibial, radial etc.) and veins of the upper and lower extremities. The condition is strongly associated with heavy tobacco use, and progression of the disease is closely linked to continued use. The typical presentations are rest pain, unremitting ischemic ulcerations, and gangrene of the digits of hands and feet, and as the disease evolves, the patients may require several surgical amputations. Olin (2000) proposes the following criteria: Age younger than 45 years Current (or recent) history of tobacco use Presence of distal extremity ischemia (indicated by claudication, pain at rest, ischemic ulcers or gangrene) documented by noninvasive vascular testing such as ultrasound Exclusion of other autoimmune diseases, hypercoagulable states, and diabetes mellitus by laboratory tests.

        "question": "Which of the following dietary interventions reduces the fuher risk in MI patientsa. EUR'",
        "exp": "n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids American Heart association has recommended guidelines for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease by dietary and other lifestyle practices. Summary of Dietary Guidelines Population Goals Overall Healthy Eating Appropriate Body Desirable Cholesterol Desirable Blood Pattern Weight Profile Pressure Major guidelines Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, low-fat or nonfat dairy products, fish, legumes, poultry, lean meats. Match energy intake to energy needs, with appropriate changes to achieve weight loss when indicated. Limit foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol; and substitute unsaturated fat from vegetables, fish, legumes, nuts. Limit salt and alcohol; maintain a healthy body weight and a diet with emphasis on vegetables, fruits, and low-fat or non-fat dairy products. AHA Guidelines about the Riven options: About n-3 Fatty Acid Supplements A number of investigators have repoed on beneficial effects of increased fatty acid intake in patients with coronary aery disease. Several of these studies used supplements containing long-chain fatty acids (EPA and DHA, or ''fish oil\") at doses ranging from 850 mg to 2. 9 g/d. Other studies have shown that higher doses (3 to 4 g/d) provided as supplements can reduce plasma triglyceride levels in patients with hyperiglyceridemia. 21 High intakes of fatty fish (1 serving per day) can result in intakes of EPA and DHA of: 1%.-900 mg/d. Fuher studies are needed to establish optimal doses of fatty acids (including EPA, DHA, and rr-linolenic acid) for both primary and secondary prevention of coronary disease as well as the treatment of hyperiglyceridemia. For secondary prevention, beneficial effects of a high dose of fatty acids on recurrent events have been repoed in the GISSI trial. A 20% reduction in overall moality (P=0. 01) and a 45% reduction in sudden death (P<0. 05) after 3. 5 years was repoed in subjects with preexisting coronary heart disease (who were being treated with conventional drugs) given 850 mg of fatty acid ethyl esters (as EPA and DHA) either with or without vitamin E (300 mg/d). Other studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of fatty acids EPA, DHA (1. 9 g/d), 2 u-and:/-linolenic acid (0. 8% of energy)ll 71 in subjects with coronary heart disease. Consumption of 1 fatty fish meal per day (or alternatively, a fish oil supplement) could result in an fatty acid intake (ie, EPA and DHA) of kc900 mg/d, an amount shown to beneficially affect coronary heart disease moality rates in patients with coronary disease. About high fibre diet The AHA recommendation is to increase fiber intake in the diet. This goal can be achieved through the guidelines for food consumption, for example, emphasis on vegetables, cereals, grains, and fruits. Although there are studies showing that specific fiber supplements are associated with lowered LDL or glucose, there are no long-term trials showing relations between these supplements and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, at this time, fiber supplements are not recommended for heart disease risk reduction. About Stanol/Sterol Ester-Containing Foods Stanol/sterol ester (plant sterols)-containing foods have been documented to decrease plasma cholesterol levels. Plant sterols, as a class of compounds, are poorly absorbed and appear to compete with cholesterol for absorption, hence decreasing the efficacy of absorption. Intakes of 2 to 3 g of plant sterols per day have been repoed to decrease total and LDL cholesterol levels by 9% to 20%. Considerable variability in response exists among individuals. Little effect of plant sterols on HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels has been repoed. Intakes of plant sterols >3 g/d confer no additional benefit with respect to total or LDL cholesterol lowering. Plasma levels of plant sterols are not or only minimally elevated after daily ingestion. Recent concern has been raised regarding the tendency of plant sterol-containing foods to decrease plasma fx- plus 13-carotene, Lr-tocopherol, and/or lycopene levels. The physiological significance of these changes is unclear at this time, but it appears prudent to recommend additional monitoring. Until long-term studies are performed to ensure the absence of adverse effects in individuals chronically ingesting plant sterol-containing foods, the use of these products should be reserved for adults requiring lowering of total and LDL cholesterol levels because of hypercholesterolemia or the need for secondary prevention after an atherosclerotic event. About Potassium Supplement A recent meta-analysis found that on average, supplementation of diets with 60 to 120 mmol of potassium per day reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, by 4. 4 and 2. 5 mm Hg in hypeensives and by 1. 8 and 1. 0 mm Hg in normotensives. Diets rich in potassium have also been associated with a reduced risk of stroke. Because a high dietary intake of potassium, magnesium, and calcium can he achieved from food sources and because diets rich in these minerals provide a variety of other nutrients, the preferred strategy for increasing mineral intake is through foods rather than supplements.

The bad point about \u03b1 blocker is that their effect lasts only till drug is given and even with continued therapy, benefits may decline after several years due to disease progression. About Combination therapy Combination of both these class of drugs is used by surgeons to derive combined benefit from both; its use is not justified in this patient as he needs to alleviate his symptoms till he gets operated - the definitive & most effective t/t.",

In this operation, first, an upper abdominal incision is made. The surgeon mobilizes the esophagus by working upward through the diaphragmatic hiatus. With the addition of an incision on the left side of the neck, the surgeon completes the mobilization of the esophagus, removes it, and moves the stomach upward through the hiatus and into the chest until its upper end appears in the neck wound. The remaining esophagus is connected to the stomach in the neck (cervical esophagogastric anastomosis). Advantages of Transhiatal esophagectomy over transthoracic esophagectomy: The two leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the first few days after a transthoracic esophagectomy are Lung complications (especially pneumonia) associated with a large operation that requires opening both the chest and the abdomen. The pain of these combined incisions may make it difficult for the patient to take a deep breath early after the operation, and this allows pneumonia to set in; and Severe infection in the chest (mediastinitis) resulting due to a \"leak\" from the intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis. After a THE, because the patient has not had the chest opened, there is less pain early after surgery, the patient can move about better as a result, and lung complications are less. Furthermore, if an anastomotic leak occurs, it can be easily managed by a simple cervical drainage as the anastomosis here is placed in the neck.",

One ofthe differences between syphilis and herpes simplex virus (HSV) is that an HSV lesion is excruciatingly painful. Treponemal organisms may be seen microscopically in the lesion if the lesion is scraped. If not treated, the chancre will disappear and the patient will be asymptomatic until he/she exhibits the signs/symptoms of secondary syphilis, which include a disseminated rash and systemic involvement such as meningitis, hepatitis, or nephritis. There are two kinds of tests for the detection of syphilis antibodies: non- specific tests such as the RPR and VORL, and specific tests such as the FT A, TPHA (T pallidum hemagglutination test), and the MHTP (microhemagglutination-T pallidum). The difference is that the nonspecific tests use a cross- reactive antigen known as cardiolipin, while the specific tests use a T pallidum antigen. Although the nonspecific tests are sensitive, they lack specificity and often cross- react in patients who have diabetes, hepatitis, or infectious mononucleosis, or who are pregnant. Some patients, especially those with autoimmune diseases, will have both nonspecific (RPR) and specific tests (FTA) positive even if they do not have syphilis. Resolution of such a situation can be done by molecular methods for T pallidum, such as PCR, or by the immobilization test using live spirochetes and the patient's serum.

        "question": "Desmoid tumor, treatment is:",
        "exp": "Desmoid tumors, also known as \"aggressive fibromatosis, \" are soft tissue lesions that behave similarly to other truncal soft tissue sarcomas but have unique characteristics. These tumors, like other soft tissue sarcomas, present as slow-growing, indolent masses (sometimes can be aggressive). Unlike typical sarcomas however, these tumors rarely metastasize. Desmoids are diffusely infiltrative and tend to recur locally, even after complete resection.. Most desmoid tumors arise sporadically, but a small percentage (-5%) occurs in association with FAP syndrome. Desmoids are classified as either abdominal or extra-abdominal. Abdominal desmoids are categorized further as superficial or infra-abdominal tumors. The superficial disease, also known as Dupuytren's fibromatosis, is slow growing, is small in size, and rarely involves deeper structures. Most of the intra-abdominal lesions are seen in association with FAP. These lesions are associated with mutations in the APC gene that are found in patients who have FAP. These tumors usually are found in the mesentery, and their growth and compression of neighboring structures can lead to significant morbidity and sometimes even death in these patients Sporadic abdominal wall desmoid tumors have been found to be associated with pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use has also been associated with the occurrence of these tumors. These associations, combined with the detection of estrogen receptors within the tumor, suggest a regulatory role for estrogen in this disease. Tissue injury, such as trauma and/or surgery, also has been implicated in tumor development. The natural history of desmoid lesions is unpredictable. Although most are indolent and slow growing, some lesions are aggressive. There are some reports of spontaneous regression, but such occurrences are mainly in women and are associated with chemical or surgical menopause. Most lesions are indolent and have benign-appearing histology, but local growth and compression have caused significant morbidity. Involvement of abdominal vessels and organs often complicates management. Patients with desmoid tumors present with a painless enlarging mass. Local symptoms may arise from compression of adjacent organs or neurovascular structures. MRI is done to define the extent of disease and its relationship with other structures. Incisional biopsy or a core needle biopsy is done to confirm the diagnosis. Management: Surgery with wide negative margins is the best treatment. Unfortunately, even with complete resection, the local recurrence rate is as high as 40%. Surgery is also the t/t of choice for recurrences. For tumors where vital visceral organs and local infiltration often make achieving negative margins difficult, other therapeutic modalities have been suggested. Antiproliferative agents and cytotoxic chemotherapy have been used to palliate these tumors with variable results. The two most widely used groups of noncytotoxic drugs are NSAIDs (such as sulindac and indomethacin) and antiestrogens(such as tamoxifen). Chemotherapy has generally been reserved for unresectable, symptomatic, and clinically aggressive disease. Partial responses have been observed after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin C, dacarbazine, or carboplatin, although toxicity has been relatively high. Radiotherapy-\"The role of radiation therapy in the management of these tumors, either as an adjunct to surgery or as primary treatment, continues to be defined. \" - Sabiston \"In summary, for easily resectable disease, surgery alone appears to be the optimal approach, especially in patients with negative microscopic margins. In advanced cases, a trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or hormonal therapy can be considered in most patients. A period of close observation is also reasonable because some patients demonstrate regression without any therapy. However, if a patient is symptomatic and not a candidate for surgery, consideration should be given to radiation or chemotherapy to increase the chance of a response. \"-Devita Oncology",

It aims at blocking the action of estrogen on estrogen receptor positive breast cells. The hormonal therapy of choice for breast cancer in premenopausal women is Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen belongs to class of drugs known as \"Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator\". Tamoxifen binds to the estrogen receptors on tumours and blocks the effect of estrogen on these cells. Tamoxifen is only effective in treating estrogen receptor positive breast cancers. - Therefore the tumour's hormone receptor status should be determined before deciding on treatment option for breast cancer. Tamoxifen is used to treat patients with early stage breast cancer as well as those with metastatic breast cancer Adjuvant therapy with Tamoxifen - Chemotherapy after primary t/t to increase the chance of cure. It helps in preventing the recurrence and also helps to prevent the development of new cancers in the other breast. When used as adjuvant chemotherapy it is usually taken for 5 years. When taken for 5 years if reduces the chance of the original breast cancer coming back in the same breast or elsewhere. It also reduces the risk of developing secondary primary cancer.

Ghai - \"Operative correction of VUR is indicated in pts. with -persistent severe (grade IV or V) reflux\". This statement does not mean that any pt. with grade IV & V reflux will be given surgical management and rest medical management. Treatment is not so clear-cut. The choice b/w medical or surgical modality is based on ceain principles (go through the following text to understand it). The below given explanation is a bit lengthy. Bear with me for giving such a long text, as it is one of the most impoant but less read topic (UG books do not give sufficient information on its treatment). This explanation will help you to tackle any future question on t/t of VUR with different patient profile (as t/t changes with grades as well as age of the patient) Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the ureter and the renal pelvis Grading of VUR: is based on the appearance of the urinary tract on Micturating Cystourethrograni reflux into a non-dilated ureter Grade I Grade II reflux into the upper collecting system without dilatation. Grade HI reflux into dilated ureter and /or blunting of calyceal fornices Grade IV reflux into a grossly dilated ureter Grade V Gross dilatation of the ureter, renal pelvis & calyces: calyces show loss of papillary impression. Complications of VUR Reflux predisposes to renal infection (pyelonephritis) by facilitating the transpo of bacteria from the bladder to the upper urinary tract. The inflammatory reaction caused by a pyelonephritic infection may result in renal injury or scarring. Extensive renal scarring impair renal function and may result in renin mediated hypertension, reflux nephropathy, renal insufficiency, end stage renal disease, reduced somatic growth and morbidity during pregnancy. Treatment The goals of t/t are to prevent pyelonephritis, renal injury, and other complication of reflux. Treatment modality is either medical or surgical. Medical therapy - is based on the principle that reflux often resolves over time and the antibiotics maintain urine sterility and prevent infection and complication while awaiting spontaneous resolution. Surgical therapy: - the basis for surgical therapy is that in selected children, ongoing reflux has caused or has significant potential for causing renal injury. The decision to do medical or surgical t/t is based on ceain principles and parental, patient preferences. Below is given a cha listing the treatment recommendation for VUR. Before going through the cha lets see the basic principles on which this cha is based? With bladder growth and maturation, there is tendency for reflux to resolve or improve over time. Lower grades of reflux are much more likely to resolve than are higher grades. For grades I & II reflux, the likelihood of resolution is similar irrespective of age at diagnosis and whetner if it unilateral or bilateral. For grade III & IV a younger age at diagnosis and unilateral reflux generally are associated with a higher rate of spontaneous resolution. Grade V reflux rarely resolves. The mean age for reflux resolution is 6 - 7 yrs. Reflux is unlikely to cause any renal injury in the absence of infection.",

Harrison 17th /e p 839 & 16th/e. p 777. 778] Intravascular catheter related infections Indwelling vascular catheters are a leading source of bloodstream infections. Amongst indwelling vascular catheters, central venous catheters are the most common culprits. Pathogenesis There are four potential sources for catheter related infections? 1) The skin inseion site 2) The catheter hub 3) Hematogenous seeding from a distant infection 4) Contaminated infilsate The skin inseion site and the catheter hub are by for the two most impoant sources. Approximately 65% of catheter related infections originate from the skin flora, 30% from the contaminated hub and 5% from other pathways. For sho term catheters, skin contamination is the most likely mechani. sm of pathogenesis. On the other hand, for long term catheters, hub contamination is more frequent because such catheters often have to be intercepted and manipulated. Skin organisms migrate from the skin inseion site along the external surface of catheter, colonizing the distal intravascular tip of the catheter, and ultimately causing blood-stream infection. On the other hand, in hub related infections, organisms are usually introduced into the hub from the hands of medical personnel and the organisms migrate along the internal surface of the catheter, where they can cause a bloodstream infection. Microbiology Most of the micro-organisms implicated in CRIs arise from the skin flora. Staphylococci are the most frequently isolated pathogens, paricularly coagulase-negative staphylococci. Etiology of catheter related infection Microorganism Percentage * Coagulase negative staphylococci 30 - 40 * Staph aureus 5-10 * Enterococci 4 - 6 * Candida spp. 3 - 6 * Pseudonzonas aeruginosa 2 - 5 * Enterobacter spp 1 - 4 * Acinetobacter spp. 1 - 2 * Serratia spp. <1 * Others < 1 - 5",

        "exp": "Leukocytosis (increased numbers of leukocytes in the peripheral blood) is a reaction seen in many different diseasestates. The type of leukocyte that is mainly increased may be an indicator of the type of disease process present. Eosinophilia can be associated with cutaneous allergic reactions; allergic disorders, such as bronchial asthma or hay fever; Hodgkin's disease; some skin diseases, such as pemphigus, eczema, and dermatitis herpetiformis; and parasitic infections, such as trichinosis (caused by infection with trichinella spiralis), schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis. The most common cause of eosinophilia is probably allergy to drugs such as iodides, aspirin, or sulfonamides, but eosinophilia is also seen in collagen vascular diseases. Marked eosinophilia occurs in hypereosinophilic syndromes (Loffler's syndrome and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome), which may be treated with coicosteroids. In contrast, neutrophilic leukocytosis (neutrophilia) may be the result of acute bacterial infections or tissue necrosis, such as is present with myocardial infarction, trauma, or burns. Basophilia is most commonly seen in immediate type (type I) hypersensitivity reactions. Both eosinophils and basophils may be increased in patients with any of the chronic myeloproliferative syndromes. Monocytosis is seen in chronic infections, such as tuberculosis, some collagen vascular diseases, neutropenic states, and some types of lymphomas. Lymphocytosis (especially with increased numbers of I lymphocytes) may be seen along with monocytosis in chronic inflammatory states or in acute viral infections, such as viral hepatitis or infectious mononucleosis.",

(2001) 30 (1): 181-182 Stomach cancer used to be the most common cause of cancer deaths in the early pa of the century. During the later half of the century a dramatic decline in the cancer incidence without any planned intervention was noted. Two major reasons have been advocated for this: 1. H. pylori infection: decrease incidence of H. pylori due to improved hygine and effective drugs. 2. Refrigeration: Refrigerators improved storage of food, thereby reducing intake of salt-based preserved food (high in nitrites and carcinogenic nitrosamines). Refrigeration also allowed for fresh food and vegetables to be more readily available, which are a valuable source of antioxidants impoant for cancer prevention. Salt-preserved foods and dietary nitrite found in preserved food are potentially carcinogenic. Intake of salted food may increase the risk of H pylori infection and act synergistically to promote the development of gastric cancer.",

Below, I have quoted the text. Read it to make your own inference. \"The most common postoperative respiratory complication is atelectasis. As a result of the anesthetic, abdominal incision, and postoperative narcotics, the alveoli in the periphery collapse and a pulmonary shunt may occur. If appropriate attention is not directed to aggressive pulmonary toilet with the initial symptoms, the alveoli remain collapsed and a buildup of secretions occurs and becomes secondarily infected with bacteria. The risk appears to be paicularly high in patients who are heavy smokers, are obese, and have copious pulmonary secretions. Pneumonia may develop early (i. e., 2-5 days after admission to the hospital) or late (i. e., >5 days) and is referred to as health care-related pneumonia. Aspiration of oropharyngeal and gastric contents is the leading cause of health care-related pneumonia. Presentation and Management The most common cause of a postoperative fever in the first 48 hours after the procedure is atelectasis. The patients has a low-grade fever, malaise, and diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields. Very often the patient is uncomfoable from the fever but has no other ove pulmonary symptoms. Atelectasis is so common postoperatively that a formal workup is not usually required. However, if not aggressively managed, frank development of pneumonia is likely. A patient with pneumonia, on the other hand, will have a high fever, occasionally mental confusion, and the production of a thick secretion with coughing, leukocytosis, and a chest radiograph that reveals infiltrates. If the condition is not expeditiously diagnosed and treated, the patient may rapidly progress to respiratory failure and require intubation. Prevention of atelectasis and pneumonia is associated with pain control, which allows the patient to take deep breaths and cough. A patient-controlled analgesia device seems to be associated with better pulmonary toilet, as does the use of an epidural infusion catheter, paicularly in patients with epigastric incisions. Respiratory care, otherwise, begins preoperatively. The patient must be instructed in use of the incentive spirometer and be held accountable by nurses and physicians during rounds. Encouraging the patient to cough while applying counterpressure with a pillow on the abdominal incision site is most helpful. Rarely, other modalities such as intermittent positive pressure breathing and chest physiotherapy may be required. Encouraging the patient to breathe deeply and cough is the single most valuable management approach in preventing and resolving atelectasis and pneumonia. Patients in whom pneumonia develops in the postoperative period are managed with aggressive pulmonary toilet, induced sputum for culture and sensitivity testing, and empirical broad-spectrum IV antibiotic therapy while awaiting culture results. Once the organisms are cultured from sputum, a specific antibiotic must be used as indicated. \"",

Vas deferens carries the sperms from epididymis to the urethra where they open by separate openings into the prostatic urethra. Just before opening each vas deferens is joined by ducts of seminal vesicles. Vas deferens and seminal vesicle ducts join to form the ejaculatory duct. The secretions of seminal vesicles form a large pa of seminal fluid and contain fructose and a coagulating enzyme called the vesiculase. Now coming to the question. Semen analysis forms an impoant pa of infeility assessment. Low ejaculatory volume is caused by retrograde ejaculation into the bladder or obstruction of the vas deferens or the ejaculatory duct Azoospermia may be seen in testicular failure or obstruction of vas deferens Absence of fructose suggests - seminal vesicles agenesis or obstruction. A semen that is low in volume with azoospermia and absence of fructose suggests -+ either obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts or congenital absence of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles. The anatomy of the vas deferens & seminal vesicles can be investigated by vasography (where contrast medium is injected into the vas deferens) or TRUS (Trans rectal ultrasonography), however TRUS is superior to vasography and is the investigation of choice.

A: Only breast These common surgical procedures for carcinoma breast include: Radical (Halsted) mastectomy is rarely used, and then only in cases where cancer cells have invaded the chest wall and the tumor is very large. The breast, pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles under the breast, and all of the lymph nodes are removed. This produces a large scar and severe disability to the arm nearest the removed breast. Modified radical (Patey) mastectomy is the most common form of mastectomy. It leaves the pectoralis major muscle intact. The breast and associated structures are removed en bloc and the excised mass is composed of: - The whole breast - A large poion of skin, the centre of which overlies the tumour but which always include the nipple - All of the fat, fascia and lymph nodes of the axilla - The pectoralis minor muscle is either divided or retracted to gain access to the upper two-thirds of the axilla. The axillary vein and the nerves to serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi (the thoraco-dorsal trunk) should be preserved. Simple, sometimes called total, mastectomy has been the treatment of choice in the late 1980s and 1990s. Generally, only the breast is removed; though, sometimes, one or two lymph nodes may be removed as well. Two other surgical procedures are variations on the simple mastectomy. The skin-sparing mastectomy is a new surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an incision, sometimes called a keyhole incision, around the areola. The tumor and all breast tissue are removed, but the incision is smaller and scarring is minimal. - The subcutaneous mastectomy, or nipple-sparing mastectomy, preserves the skin and the nipple over the breast. Paial mastectomy is used to remove the tumor, the lining over the chest muscle underneath the tumor, and a good poion of breast tissue, but not the entire breast. This is a good treatment choice for early stage cancers. Lumpectomy just removes the tumor and a small amount of tissue surrounding it. Some lymph nodes may be removed as well. This procedure is gaining acceptance among surgeons and patients alike.",

The process has been associated with thickening of connective tissue as in acromegaly, or with deposition of amyloid. It also occurs in hypothyroidism, rheumatoid ahritis, and diabetes mellitus. As in this patient, numbness occurs in the distribution of the median nerve. Later in the process, atrophy of the abductor pollicis brevis becomes apparent. The Tinel sign (parasthesia induced in the median nerve distribution by a reflex hammer hitting on the volar aspect of the wrist) is very characteristic. De Quervain's tenosynovitis causes focal wrist pain on the radial aspect of the hand and is due to inflammation of the tendon sheath of the abductor pollicis longus. It should not produce a postive Tinel sign. Amylotrophic lateral sclerosis may present with distal muscle weakness that is diffuse and not focal. Diffuse atrophy and muscle fasiculations would be prominent. Rheumatoid ahritis would not produce these symptoms unless inflammation of the wrist was causing median nerve entrapment in the carpal tunnel.",

Trauma is usually severe associated with concussion and skull fracture. With aerial bleeding, the hematoma expands rapidly, and symptoms appear within hours after injury. The clinical course is acute? After a head injury often associated with a variable period of concussion - the patient appears normal for several hours (lucid interval). After this lucid interval, the pt. develops evidence of increased intracranial pressure with headache, vomitting, altered consciousness, and papilledema. Tentorial herniation rapidly follows, with occulomotor nerve palsy (pupillary inequality appears first, followed by failure of reaction to light k/a Hutchinson's sign and pyramidal tract compression.

Chronic Subdural hematoma Accumalation of blood in the subdural space It occurs mainly in elderly patients with some degree of cerebral atrophy. The amount of trauma required is minimal. Bleeding is the result of rupture of communicating veins passing from the cerebral coex to the superior saggital sinus. Rupture occurs when there is movement of the brain relative to the fixed superior saggital sinus and is most likely when cerebral atrophy is present. Clinical course is slow (over days to month). - Pt. presents with slowly increasing intracranial pressure, causing headache, vomitting, papillcdema and fluctuating levels of consciousness. - Compression of the underlying brain may cause focal epileptic convulsions and neurological symptoms, most commonly contralateral spastic paralysis with prolonged but less severe compression, atrophy of the brain occurs and cause dementia.

        "question": "Which drug is not used to prevent contrastnephropathy a. EUR'",
        "exp": "Fenoldopam The administration of radiocontrast media can lead to a usually reversible form of acute kidney injury (formerly called acute renal failure) that begins soon after the contrast is administered. In most cases, there are no permanent sequelae, but there is some evidence that its development is associated with adverse outcomes. Prevention There is no specific treatment once contrast-induced acute renal failure develops, and management must be as, for any cause of acute tubular necrosis, with the focus on maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance. The best treatment of contrast-induced renal failure is prevention. A variety of preventive measures may reduce the risk of contras nephropathv. Types of radiocontrast agents Iodinated radiocontrast agents are either ionic or nonionic and, at the concentrations required for aeriography or computed tomography, are of variable osmolality: First generation agents are ionic monomers; they are highly hyperosmolal (approximately 1400 to 1800 mosmol/kg) compared with the osmolality of plasma. Second generation agents, such as iohexol, are nonionic monomers with a lower osmolality than the first generation radiocontrast media. - The newest nonionic contrast agents are isoosmolal. These isoosmolal agents have a lower osmolality than \"low osniolal\" second generation drugs. The iso-osnzolal nonionic contrast agent iodixanol appears to reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy in high-risk patients, such as diabetic patients with renal insufficiency, compared to the low osmolal nonionic agent iohexol, but not when compared to other low osnzolal nonionic agents. -However, additional randomized prospective trials comparing iodixanol (or other iso-osmolal agents if developed) to other low osmolal ionic or nonionic agents are required before it can be determined that isoosmolal contrast agents are uniformly less nephrotoxic than low osmolal agents as a class, especially given the substantially greater expense of the only currently available iso-osmolal nonionic agent, iodixanol. Hydration, mantilla, and diuretics Hydration is beneficial, and the type of hydration solution may be impoant. In comparison, the role of diuretics, mannitol and other renal vasodilators in this setting is unceain. Diuretics Several small trials have investigated the effect of diuretics. In one trial, 78 patients with stable chronic renal failure (mean plasma creatinine concentration 2. 1 ing/dL or >25 percent, measured 2 to 5 days after the procedure) occurred less frequently among patients who received iloprost compared to placebo (8 versus 22 percent respectively). - Severe hypotension required withdrawal of Iloprost in three patients. Although Iloprost may be effective in the prevention of contrast nephropathy, confirmation of these results in larger definitive trials is necessary before its use can be recommended. Fetzoldopanz - A prospective randomized trial (CONTRAST) assessed the effectiveness of fenoldopam in 315 patients (one-half diabetic) undergoing a cardiovascular procedure who had chronic renal. failure with an estimated creatinine clearance below 60 mllmin (mean 29 m1/min with a mean serum creatinine of 1. 8 mg/dL ). - All patients also received one-half normal saline as mentioned above, and contrast nephropathy was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of?.. 25 percent above baseline in the first four days. - There was no reduction in the incidence of contrast nephropathy in the fenoldopam group (34 versus 30 percent with placebo). It has been proposed that direct intrarenal administration may be more beneficial. Endothelia: receptor antagonist - A nonselective endothelin receptor antagonist was tested in a multicenter, double-blind randomized trial of high-risk patients undergoing coronary angiography. Compared with those assigned to placebo, a significantly higher percentage of patients who received active therapy sustained contrast nephropathy (56 versus 29 percent); this observation raises the possibility that endothelin may actually provide an intrinsic protective effect rather than contributing to the development of acute renal failure. Alternatively, selective endothelin receptor antagonists may be required to demonstrate prophylactic value in this setting. Summary And Recommendations Optimal therapy to prevent contrast-induced acute renal failure remains unceain. Patients with near-normal renal function are at little risk and, few precautions are necessary other than avoidance of volume depletion. We recommend the following preventive measures for patients at increased risk of contrast nephropathy, which is defined a serum creatinine 1. 5 mg/d1. (132 tnicromol/L) or an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/1. 73 m2, Use, if -possible, ultrasonography, MRI without gadolinium contrast, or CT scanning without radiocontrast agents. We recommend NOT using high osmolul agents. We recommend the use of iodixanol or nonionic low osmolal agents such as iopamidol or ioversol rather than iohexol. Use lower doses of contrast and avoid repetitive, closely spaced studies. Avoid volume depletion and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If there are no contraindications to volume expansion, we recommend isotonic intravenous fluids prior to and continued for several hours after contrast administration. The optimal type of fluid and timing of administration are not well established. We suggest isotonic bicarbonate rather than isotonic saline. Despite conflicting data, we suggest that acetylcysteine be administered the day before and the day of the procedure, based upon its potential. for benefit and low toxicity and cost. If acetylcysteine is administered, we suggest giving 1200 mg orally twice daily rather than 600 mg twice daily the day before and the day of the procedure. Based upon the lack of convincing evidence of benefit and the potential risk of anaphylactoid reactions, we suggest not using intravenous acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast nephropathy. (Note: Oral acetylcysteine is used.) We recommend NOT using mannitol or other diuretics prophylactically. Among patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD, we recommend NOT performing prophylactic hemofiltration or hemodialysis after contrast exposure. Among patients with stage 5 CKD, we suggest prophylactic hemodialysis after contrast exposure if there is already a. functioning hemodialysis access.",

        "question": "Which is useful to decrease moality and renal failure in acute liver disease due to alcoholism",
        "exp": "Pentoxyfylline Therapies for Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis and/or Alcoholic Cirrhosis Coicosteroids The rationale underlying the use of coicosteroids in acute alcoholic hepatitis is to ameliorate the characteristic inflammatory response which accompanies this disorder. These agents have well-known effects on the immune response, and reduce cytokine production, suppress the formation of acetaldehyde adducts and inhibit the production of collagen. Coico. ste raids have been studied in several randomized double-blind trials, and have been subject to a number of meta-analyses. Despite this intense interest, neither the source studies nor the meta-analyses have reached a consensus conclusion regarding the efficacy of coicosteroids in the treatment of acute alcoholic hepatitis. The most recent study of Mathurin et al. re-analysed the original data from three randomized trials that included patients with severe illness (102 patients were treated with placebo and 113 were treated with steroids). The 28-day survival was higher in the coicosteroid group, so that, for every five patients treated, one death was avoided. This benefit was consistent during the first year of treatment, but disappeared at 2 years of follow-up. Despite the apparent benefit of coicosteroids in severe illness, many clinicians remain sceptical about their use. One explanation for this phenomenon is that many potential candidates for coicosteroid therapy have one or more contraindications to treatment, such as coincidental bacterial infections, gastrointestinal bleeding or renal failure. An additional reason may be the conflicting data. from trials, including meta-analyses, which have failed to demonstrate a benefit of coicosteroids. Oxpentifylline (Pentoxifylline) Oxpentifylline (pentoxifylline) is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of intermittent claudication. - In addition to improving the responses of red blood cells to defonning stress, oxpentifylline (pentoxifylline) inhibits the output of TNF-a by modulating the transcription of the TNF-a gene. Recently, Akridis et al. repoed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of oxpentifylline (pentoxifylline) involving 101 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. - Hepatorenal syndrome was the cause of death in six of 12 cases (50%) in the treated group and 22 of 24 cases (91. 7%) in tire placebo group. Thus, the benefit of oxpentifylline (pentoxifylline) in treating acute alcoholic hepatitis appears to be related to a significant decrease in the risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome. - Although these data provide evidence of a dramatic benefit, they await the validation of independent randomized controlled clinical trials. Anti-TNF Therapy Acute alcoholic hepatitis is a potentially impoant indication for the use of direct anti-TNF-a agents, although the liming of their administration in relation to the last use of alcohol and the provision of appropriate prophylaxis against infection may be critical practical issues. - Up to now, only two human studies utilizing direct anti-TNF therapy in acute alcoholic hepatitis have been repoed. In one, the monoclonal antibody anti-TNF-a (infliximab) was compared with placebo in patients with alcoholic hepatitis receiving coicosteroids. - Although the histology did not improve, the 28-day Maddrey score Unproved significantly in the group receiving anti-TNF. Unfounately, moality data were not repoed and, in their absence, the interpretation of the Maddrey score as a surrogate end-point is questionable. In another recent study, open-label uncontrolled use of infliximab was described in 12 patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The authors repoed that more than 80% of patients survived for 15 months from the initiation of therapy. Although TNFa messenger RNA expression in the liver did not change, the expression of IL-8, a cytokine regulated mainly by TNF-a, was almost absent on day 28. 1 Both studies provide suppo for randomized controlled trials of -04 appropriate power to determine whether anti-TNF-a treatment is efficacious in acute alcoholic hepatitis. Despite the evidence that alcoholic liver disease is associated with enhanced oxidative stress, this research has not been translated into clinical therapy. Studies published in abstract form have failed to show that different kinds of antioxidants (when compared with coicosteroids or placebo) confer any benefit in the treatment of acute alcoholic hepatitis. Turning to the use of antioxidants in the setting of cirrhosis, there have been several trials using silymarin (milk thistle) as antioxidant. In a double-blind, prospective, randomized clinical trial involving 170 patients with cirrhosis (91 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis), 87 patients were treated with 140 mg silymarin three times daily and 83 patients received placebo. The mean observation period was 41 months. Fifty of 87 (58%) silymarin-treated patients, as opposed to 32 of 83 (39%) placebo-treated patients, survived for 4 years or longer. This difference, which was significant at the P Another goal of antioxidant therapy involves the enhancement of the cell's own antioxidant capacity, which is the rationale for external supplementation of S-adenosyl methionine. A randomized, double-blind trial of S-adenosyl methionine or placebo was perfonned in 123 alcoholic cirrhotic patients. The overall moality/liver transplantation at the end of the trial decreased, from 30% in the placebo group to 16% in the treated group, although this difference was not statistically significant. In summary, there remains a lack of compelling evidence that antioxidants, such as silymarin, or membrane stabilizers, such as S-adenosyl methionine, exe a substantial salutary effect in patients with cirrhosis due to alcohol-mediated liver injury. Propylthiouracil The rationale underlying the use of propylthiouracil in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease rests on the observation that the most severe alcohol-induced damage is often in the perivenular area (zone 3), thereby resembling ischaemic injury. The putative mechanism of propylthiouracil to produce a benefit in this setting is by reducing hepatic oxygen consumption by hepatocytes. An initial trial by Halle et al. found no benefit of propylthiouracil in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Some years later, Orrego et al. observed, in a larger coho, that the administration of propylthiouracil reduced the moality due to alcoholic liver disease. This randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was remarkable Pr the care taken to monitor alcohol consumption by the study paicipants and thereby control for the greatest confounding factor complicating the interpretation of investigations of treatment for alcoholic liver disease. Despite such admirable study design and the demonstration of a statistically impressive benefit in propylthiouracil recipients compared with controls, propylthiouracil has not gained currency as a treatment for alcoholic liver disease. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis, including data from 710 patients with several forms of alcoholic liver disease, could not demonstrate any benefit of propylthiouracil on moality, liver-related moality, liver complications or liver histology. Colchicine Colchicine is an inhibitor of collagen synthesis. Unfounately, results regarding the use of colchicine in the treatment of liver cirrhosis are conflicting. The most potent data in suppo of its use come from the study by Kershenobich et al. In their study of colchicine for the treatment of all forms of cirrhosis, the 5-year survival rate was 74% in the colchicine-treated group compared with 34% in the placebo group. The 10-year survival rate was twice as great for the colchicinetreated group. This study was confounded by the high dropout rate. Fuhermore, a recent meta-analysis conducted by Rambaldi and Gluud, combining the results of 14 randomized clinical trials involving 1150 patients, demonstrated no significant beneficial effects of colchicine on moality, liver-related moality. complications of liver failure, liver biochemistry, liver histology or alcohol consumption. Conversely, colchicine was associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse events. Phosphatidylcholine Encouraging results have been obtained with some 'super' nutrients in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease. Phosphatidylcholine, purified from polyunsaturated lecithin, was discovered to oppose ethanol-induced fibrosis by decreasing the activation of stellate cells to transitional cells, and possibly also by stimulating collagenase activity. Recent evidence has suggested that phosphatidylcholine may have an effect on alcohol-induced liver damage by decreasing the activities of cytochrome P450 2. E1, an oxidative enzyme implicated in alcohol metabolism, and by modulating TNF-a. Recently, a randomized, prospective, double-blind, clinical trial comparing phosphatidylcholine with placebo was conducted in 789 male alcoholics at 20 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. All subjects demonstrated hepatic fibrosis that did not meet the criteria for cirrhosis on liver biopsy prior to the initiation of the study. Treatment was maintained for 2 years. No histological benefit was observed in the treated group compared with the placebo group",

Proximal to ileocecal valve by 100 cm. Usually within 45 to 60 cm of ileocecal valve. Differential Diagnosis of Meckel's Diveiculitis-Appendicitis. Complications of Meckel's Diveiculum- GI Bleeding (25-50% of complications). Often associated with ectopic gastric mucosa. Hemorrhage is most common presentation under age 2- Meckel's Diveiculitis (10-20% of complications)-Similar in presentation to Appendicitis- Bowel Obstruction. Volvulus at fibrotic band attached to abdominal wall. Intussusception. Incarcerated Inguinal Hernia (Littre's hernia)- Other complications-Carcinoid Tumor. Radiology- Radionuclide Scintigraphy (Sodium Tc-peechnetate). Preferential uptake by gastric tissue.

        "exp": "Ans. c. EGFR mutations Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in many types of cancers, especially colorectal cancer (CRC), and seems to reflect more aggressive histological and clinical behaviours. It was observed that EGFR was significantly associated with TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) stage T3. In the context of a new therapeutic strategy using EGFT-targeted therapies (e. g. cetuximab), although EGFR remains a controversial prognostic factor, this expression-stage association may play a crucial role in a decision to initiate an adjuvant treatment. \"- Deng Y, Jurland B, Wang. 1, Bi. 1, Li W, Rao S, Lan P, Lin T and Lin E. High epidermal growth factor receptor expression in metastatic colorectal cancer lymph nodes may be more prognostic of poor survival than in primary tumor. Am J Clin Oncol. 2009; 32:(3): 245-52. High EGFR expressions in metastatic lymph nodes seem to be more accurate in predicting survival than in primary or metastatic tissues. Microsatellite Instability: (Robbil, ) The microsatellite instability pathway is characterized by genetic lesions in mismatched repair genes. It is involved in 10 to 15% of sporadic cases of colon cancer and in the hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome. Mutations in the mismatch repair genes cause alternation of microsatellites, leading to microsatellite instability. These satellites are prone to misalignment during DNA replication. Most microsatellite sequences are in the non-coding regions of the genes, and hence, mutations in these genes are probably harmless. However, some microsatellite sequences are located in the coding or promotor regions of genes involved in regulation of cell growth. Loss of mismatch repair genes leads to accumulation of these and other growth-regulating genes, culminating in the emergence of colorectal carcinoma. C-MYC Mutations: In human colorectal adenocarcinomas, overexpression of the c-myc m. RNA has been repoed to occur in 60-80% of cases. C-myc has been characterized as a proto-oncogene, which promotes cell proliferation. However, overexpression of the c-myc m. RNA is associated with a more ourable prognosis. k-RAS mutations: The k-RAS is the most frequently observed activated oncogene in adenomas and colon cancers. k-RAS plays a role in intracellular signal transduction and is mutated in fewer than 10% of adenomas less than 1 cm in size, in about 50% of adenomas larger than I cam and in approximately 50% of carcinomas.",

Most tumors are observed on the face, although the trunk and extremities also are affected Cystic basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant of nodular basal cell carcinoma, cystic basal cell carcinoma is often indistinguishable from nodular basal cell carcinoma clinically, although it might have a polypoid appearance Pigmented basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant of nodular basal cell carcinoma that has brown-black macules in some or all areas, often making it difficult to differentiate from melanoma. Morpheaform (sclerosing) basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant in which tumor cells induce a proliferation of fibroblasts within the dermis and an increased collagen deposition (sclerosis) that clinically resembles a scar.

Esophagus is removed through the diaphragmatic hiatus by making incisions in the abdomen and the neck. In this operation, first an upper abdominal incision is made. The surgeon mobilizes the esophagus by working upward through the diaphragmatic hiatus. With the addition of an incision on the left side of the neck, the surgeon completes the mobilization of the esophagus, removes it, and moves the stomach upward through the hiatus and into the chest until its upper end appears in the neck wound. The remaining esophagus is connected to the stomach in the neck (cervical esophagogastric anastomosis). Advantages of Transhiatal esophagectomy over transthoracic esophagectomy: The two leading causes of morbidity and moality in the first few days after a transthoracic esophagectomy are 1) Lung complications (especially pneumonia) associated with a large operation that requires opening both the chest and the abdomen. The pain of these combined incisions may make it difficult for the patient to take a deep breath early after the operation, and this allows pneumonia to set in; and 2) Severe infection in the chest (mediastinitis) resulting due to a \"leak\" from intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis. After a TIC, because the patient has not had the chest opened, there is less pain early after surgery, the patient can move about better as a result, and lung complications are less. Fuhermore, if an anastomotic leak occurs, it can be easily managed by a simple cervical drainage as the anastomosis here is placed in the neck.",

        "exp": "Fracture both bones of forearm may result in severe loss of function unless adequately treated by restoring normal relationship of radius and ulna. The relationship of radio humeral, ulno humeral, proximal radioulnar, radio carpal and distal radioulnar joints and the interosseous space must be anatomical or some functional impairment will occur. In addition to regaining length, and axial alignment (by reducing angulation), achieving normal rotational alignment is necessary if a good, range of pronation and supination is to be restored. Forearm rotation is vulnerable to any malalignment of radius and accurate rotational as well as axial reduction is necessary. Malunion and nonunion occur more frequently because of the difficulty in reducing and maintaining the reduction of two parallel bones in the presence of pronating and supinating muscles that have angulating and rotational influences. Because of these factors open reduction and internal fixation (by plating) of displaced diaphyseal fractures in adult is accepted as best method of treatment.

In patients with glaucoma, this latter effect permits greater drainage of the aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork in the canal of Schlemm and a reduction in resistance to outflow of the aqueous humor. Ceain b-adrenergic blocking agents (e. g., timolol and levobunolol) applied to the eye are also very useful in treating chronic wide-angle glaucoma. These drugs appear to act by decreasing the secretion (or formation) of the aqueous humor by antagonizing the effect of circulating catecholamines on 13- b-adrenergic receptors in the ciliary epithelium",
