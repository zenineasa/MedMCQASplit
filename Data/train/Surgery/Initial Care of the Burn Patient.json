In adults, each upper extremity and the head and neck are 9% of TBSA, the lower extremities and the anterior and posterior aspects of the trunk are 18% each, and the perineum and genitalia are assumed to be 1% of TBSA.# Another method of estimating smaller burns is to consider the area of the open hand (including the palm and extended fingers) of the patient to be approximately 1% of TBSA and then transpose that measurement visually onto the wound for a determination of its size. This method is helpful when evaluating splash burns and other bums of mixed distribution. Figure (L & B 26th/389): The Lund and Browder chart. Age in year0151015.

In adults, each upper extremity and the head and neck are 9% of TBSA (total body surface area), the lower extremities and the anterior and posterior aspects of the trunk are 18% each, and the perineum and genitalia are assumed to be 1% of TBSA. Degree of burn has nothing to do with calculation of percentage of burns. However different degrees of burns can be allotted their respective shares; for example a total of 27% burns as in this case can be said as 9% of 3rd degree + 18% of 2nd degree Note that- 1st degree burns are not considered in calculating the total area of burns in adults. However in children and infants, 1st degree burns are taken into consideration.",
