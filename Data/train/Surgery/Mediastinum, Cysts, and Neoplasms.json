        "exp": "Ans: A (Neruofibroma) Ref: Bobbins Pathologic basis of Disease, 8th ed. Explanation: Mediastinal Tumors. Anterior (front) mediastinum. Germ cell Tumors - The majority of germ cell neoplasms (60 to 70%) are benign and are found in both males and females. Lymphoma - Malignant tumors that include both Hodgkin's disease and non Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thymoma and thymic cyst - The most common cause of a thymic mass, the majority of thymomas are benign lesions that are contained within a fibrous capsule. However, about 30% of these may be more aggressive and become invasive through the fibrous capsule. Mediastinal Thyroid mass - Usually a benign growth, such as a goiter, these can occasionally be cancerous. Middle mediastinum. Bronchogenic cyst - A benign growth with respiratory origins. Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy - An enlargement of the lymph nodes. Pericardial cyst - A benign growth that results from an ''out-pouching\" of the pericardium (the heart's lining). Mediastinal Thyroid mass - Usually a benign growth, such as a goiter. These types of tumors can occasionally be cancerous. Tracheal tumors - These include tracheal neoplasms and non-euplastic masses, such as tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica (benign tumors). Vascular abnormalities including aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection. Posterior (back) mediastinum. Extramedullary haematopoiesis - A rare cause of masses that form from bone marrow expansion and are associated with severe anemia. Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy- An enlargement of the lymph nodes. Mediastinal Neuroenteric cyst- A rare growth, which involves both neural and gastrointestinal elements. Mediastinal Neurogenic neoplasm- The most common cause of posterior mediastinal tumors, these are classified as nerve sheath neoplasms, ganglion cell neoplasms, and paraganglionic cell neoplasms. Approximately 70%. of neurogenic neoplasms are benign. Oesophageal abnormalities including achalasia oesophageal, oesophageal neoplasm and hiatal hernia. Paravertebral abnormalities including infectious, malignant and traumatic abnormalities of the thoracic spine. Mediastinal Thyroid mass- Usually a benign growth, such as a goiter, which can occasionally be cancerous. Vascular abnormalities - Includes aortic aneurysms.",
