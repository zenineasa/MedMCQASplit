Injuries can occur to any pa of the body, but the limbs and head are paicularly susceptible to serious injury. Impact with the road surface or another vehicle at speed often causes skull fracture, even in the presence of a helmet. A transverse fracture across the floor of the skull, usually called a \"hinge fracture\", is sometimes referred to as motorcyclist fracture.

Management Management of colonoscopic perforation depends upon the size of the perforation, the duration of time since the injury, and the overall condition of the patient A large perforation recognized during the procedure requires surgical exploration. Because the bowel has almost always been prepared prior to the colonoscopy, there is usually little contamination associated with these injuries and most can be repaired primarily. If there is significant contamination, if there has been a delay in diagnosis with resulting peritonitis, or if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, proximal diversion with or without resection is the safest approach. Occasionally, a patient will develop abdominal pain and localized signs of perforation after what was thought to be an uneventful colonoscopy. Many of these patients will have a \"microperforation\" which will resolve with bowel rest, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and close observation. Evidence of peritonitis or any deterioration in clinical condition mandates exploration. Similarly, free retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal air may be discovered incidentally after colonoscopy. In a completely asymptomatic patient, this finding is thought to result from barotrauma and dissection of air through tissue planes without a free perforation. Many of these patients canbe successfully treated with bowel rest & broad-spectrum antibiotics. Surgical exploration is indicated for any clinical deterioration.",

        "exp": "Thallium scan Thallium scanning Principle Thallium is a monovalent cation which acts as potassium analogue. It is taken up by ble cells - not dead ones. It is distributed to all pas of the body, largely in propoion to the regional blood flow. The concentration of thallium in the myocardium is propoional to the coronary blood flow over a wide range of flows. Once inside the myocardial cell, the thallium does not stay there. There is constant and continuous thallium exchange. Over a period of time thallium washes out of the normal cells and some thallium is extracted by the hypoperfusedareas. This unique propey is taken advantage of clinically during thallium stress testing and is the basis for the redistribution or late 4 hour image. Clinical application: Exercise is the most. frequently used form of stress in the testing of cardiac. function. During exercise myocardial blood flow normally increases by upto 3-4 folds to supply the increase in 0, demand. If coronary flow is limited by a stenosis there will be less thallium extracted. from the blood by the myocardium in the territoy of that aery compared with the normal, surrounding myocardium. This will cause a perfusion defect. Over 2-4 hours, this perfusion defect will redistribute or fill in as thallium washes out of the normally perfused cells and some more thallium is extracted by the hypoperfused myocardial cells Hence in ischemia the thallium perfusion defect disappears with time and is called a reversible defect. By contrast, areas of scar tissue or infarction do not change with time and appear as fixed defects. Clinical utility - interpretation No ischemia: In a patient without significant CAD, there will be uniform distribution of thallium in all myocardial segment's in the immediate post stress and 4 hour redistribution image. if the thallium scan is normal there is usually a very low probability, of angiographically significant CAD. Ischemia present: In a patient with significant CAD, (a stenosis of at least 70%), myocardial thallium uptake will be reduced causing a perfusion defect in the distribution of the stenosed vessel in the immediate poststress image. After 4 hours, the perfusion defect will 'fill in' or redistribute giving a unifonn thallium distribution, throughout the myocardium,, on reimagingo. Some perfusion defects only paially redistribute or do not \"fill in' at all by 4 hours. These patient are now re-injected with a smaller dose of thallium and reimaged after 30 minutes or alternatively reimaged at 24 hours without reinjection. Following reinjection and /or delayed imaging patients with severe ischemia usually demonstrate, full or paial redistribution. Fixed defects which do not show redistribution are interpreted as scar tissue from myocardial infarction or nonble myocardium, which would at not benefit from revascularisatioe Viability The question of whether myocardium is ble can also be addressed, using rest and redistribution imaging. Following thallium injection, coronary blood flow at rest is assessed immediately and again at 4 hour. In a patient with a critical stenosis there will be very low flow at rest, producing a perfusion defect of varying severity. If there is ble myocardium present, the defect will resdistribute over time.",

The classic examples are frontal collision in motor vehicle injury or a fall from height. Most common site is --> proximal descending thoracic aoa Investigation - Spiral CT scan is used for screening, and if mediastinal hematoma found, an aoography or CT angiography is done to clearly define the site and extent of injury. Aoography is the gold standard imaging modality. - CT angiography is rapidly becoming an imaging modality that rivals aoography and as technology improves may soon replace aoography as the imaging modality of choice. Management The traditional management is prompt surgical repair of the injured aoic segmenet. However in some patients a purposeful delay or even non-operative management is done. Patients with associated severe head injury or other complex multisystem injury are unable to tolerate the aoic repair and reconstructive surgery. Use of early blood pressure control and afterload reduction conves these cases from urgent to delayed cases, and can be repaired next day or several days later and can be transferred to higher centres with expes. Non-operative management can be tried in minimal blunt aoic injury (such as small intimal flap or a small pseudoaneurysm). However long term behaviour of these minimal injuries managed non-operatively is not known and hence they must be monitored by serial imaging. Use of endovascular graft is fast gaining in popularity despite lack of controlled trials and long term follow-up. This is due to significantly decreased moality and morbidity associated with use of grafts in comparison to open thoracic aoic repair. Endovascular grafts are paicularly attractive for patients who are poor candidates for open thoracic aoic repairs such as those with multiple associated injuries or in whom systemic heparin is contraindicated.",

Symptoms include odynophagia (pain on swallowing foods or fluids), subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema, pleural effusion, air in the retro-esophageal space and unexplained fever within 24 hours of injury. Mediastinal and deep cervical emphysema must be seen as evidence of an aerodigestive injury until proven otherwise. If the diagnosis is made early, primary surgical repair is generally possible. If the diagnosis is delayed for more than 24 hours, primary repair may be impractical, with diversion and drainage being the only alternative. The major morbidity and moality associated with esophageal injuries are the result of delay in diagnosis, which underscores the necessity to aggressively exclude esophageal injury during the initial evaluation of a patient with neck injury. \"The moality rate rises exponentially if treatment is delayed for more than 12-24 hours. \"- Bailey and Love. Esophagoscopy can be performed to evaluate the esophagus, but injuries have been missed with this technique alone. Therefore patients at risk should also undergo a soluble contrast esophagram looking for extravasation of contrast. If no extravasation is seen, a barium esophagram should be performed for greater detail. Failure to identify esophageal injuries leads to fulminant mediastinitis that is often fatal. Treatment consists of early debridement, primary repair, and drainage if identified within 24 hours after injury. Injuries diagnosed after 24 hours with mediastinal contamination are treated by cervical esophagostomy and distal feeding access. Esophageal resection is rarely needed but may be indicated in patients with esophageal necrosis or severe mediastinitis.. A drain should be left in place after all esophageal repairs.",

This improvement in survival is due to treatment of a large number of children on sequential standardized research protocols.

[The \"rim sign, \" originally repoed by Smith in 1995, is described as a rim, ring, or halo of soft tissue visible on CT scans that completely surrounds ureteral stones. The effect is enhanced by the local inflammation a stone produces in the ureteral wall, with subsequent edema at the site of the calculus. The rim sign is generally missing or incomplete with phleboliths. While not absolutely definitive, the rim sign is strong evidence that the calcific density it surrounds is a stone and not a phlebolith. In several studies, more than 75% of all ureteral stones demonstrated a rim sign, while only 2-8% of phleboliths demonstrated it. The rim sign is more likely to be present in small or medium stones up to 5 mm in diameter. Larger stones, bigger 6 mm, tend to lose the rim sign, presumably from stretching and thinning of the ureteral wall around a relatively large calculus. (Reff*",

As the O2 is continuously absorbed by the middle ear mucosa it results in negative middle ear pressure unless the Eustachian tube opens to replenish the ear. Negative pressure leads to transudation of fluid into the middle ear and if the hypoxia continues a mucoid exudate is produced by the glands of middle ear mucosa (glue ear).

A Female patient with Raynaud's phenomenon should be evaluated for possibility of scleroderma or any other connective tissue disease. Raynaud's phenomenon is the first manifestation of scleroderma in almost every patient with the disease and it preceedes other symptoms in 70% of casesQ The interval between Raynaud's phenomenon and appearance of other manifestations is generally brief (weeks to months) in diffuse scleroderma, while in limited scleroderma the period of onset between Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic manifestations is commonly several years. Scleroderma is a rare disorder but it initially presents with Raynaud's phenomenon which is quite frequent in the general population. Therefore it is impoant to keep sclerodenna in mind while dealing with Raynaud's phenomenon. More on Scleroderma: Scleroderma is primarily a disease of the female? (female to male ratio of 3: 1) with a peak incidence in the 50 - 60 year age group. Raynaud's phenomenon occurs due to microvascular involvement?. Microvascular disease is consistently present early in the course of systemic sclerosis. Intimal proliferation is evident in 100% of digital aeries of patients with systemic sclerosis. Capillary dilatation with leaking as well as destruction is also common. Stress and cold temperature induce an exaggerated vasoconstriction of the small aeries, aeioles and aeriovenous shunts of the skin of the digits. This is manifested clinically as pallor and cyanosis of the digits followed by reactive hyperemia after rewarming. Unlike episodes of uncomplicated primary Raynaud's phenomenon, attacks of Raynaud phenomenon in patient with sclerodenria are often painful and frequently lead to digital ulcerations, gangrenes or amputation. Also know Diseases associated with Raynaud's phenomenon: Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with several connective tissue disease. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) Systemic lupus erythematosus Rheumatoid ahritis Sjogren syndrome Dermatomyositis Polymyositis Vasculitis All patients with history of Raynaud's phenomenon should be asked about symptoms suggestive of autoimmune disease such as ahritis, dry eyes or dry mouth, myalgias, fever, skin rash or cardiomyopathy abnormalities. If underlying autohnmune disease is suspected, the patient should be evaluated for presence of specific autoantibodies. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) assays are highly sensitive for the type of connective tissue disorders that are often associated with Raynaud's phenomenon. However, positive ANA, are quite nonspecific and therefore should be followed by testing for autoantibodies with higher positive predictive values for such conditions.",

The earlier the symptoms arise the worst is the prognosis. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia It is the herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity through the diaphragmatic defect The defect may be posterolateral (Bochdalek hernia) retrosternal (Morgagni hernia) at the esophageal hiatus (hiatal hernia) adjacent to the hiatus (paresophageal hernia) Although all these defects are congenital, the term congenital diaphragmatic hernia is generally used for Bochdalek hernia. Bochdalek hernia Most Bochdalek hernia are on the left side (-80%)and may rarely be bilateral. Compression of the lung results in pulmonary hypoplasia, involving both the lungs (ipsilateral > contralateral) Pulmonary vasculature is also abnormal leading to pulmonary hypertension. Thus the two main factors that affect morbidity and moality are pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. The most frequent clinical presentation of CDH is respiratory distress due to severe hypoxemia. - The anteroposterior diameter of the chest may be large along with a scaphoid abdomen. The diagnosis of CDH can be made prenatally by ultrasound. The postnatal diagnosis is relatively straightforward because a plain chest radiograph demonstrates the gastric air bubbles or loops of bowel within the chest. There may also be a mediastinal shift away from the side of the hernia.",

At about the fouh week of embryonic life, 4 branchial (or pharyngeal) clefts develop between 5 ridges known as the branchial (or pharyngeal) arches. These arches and clefts contribute to the formation of various structures of the head and neck. The second arch grows downwards and ultimately covers the third and fouh arches. The buried clefts normally disappear around the seventh week of development. If a poion of the cleft remains entrapped and fails to disappear, its remnants form a cyst. Branchial cleft cysts are the most common of congenital neck masses. They are bilateral in about 2-3% of the cases. Usually, they do not appear at bih, but become noticeable much later in life. They are usually lined by squamous epithelium, and contains thick, turbid fluid full of cholesterol crystals. They are usually located at the junction of the upper third and middle third of the sternomastoid muscle at its anterior border. It is a fluctuant swelling that may transilluminate. If they get infected, they may form a deep neck abscess or a draining fistula. USG and fine-needle aspiration both aids diagnosis. The treatment of branchial cleft cysts is surgical excision.",

        "exp": "Paget disease The clinical and lab. findings in this elderly male along with characteristic x-ray findings are indicative of Paget ds. Paget disease Paget disease, a relatively common bone disorder, is a chronic progressive disturbance in bone metabolism that primarily effects older persons. Male > Females (3: 2) Pathology The basic pathological process in Paget disease involves the balance between hone resorption and new bone formation (Osteoclastic and osteoblastic bone activity) The disease passes through three stages: 1st - Oeolytic or hot phase - the pathological process is initiated by overactive osteoclastic bone resorption. IInd - Intermediatior Mixed phase - Osteoclastic hone resorption is followed by compensatory increase in osteoblastic new bone formation. 111rd - Cool Phase - this is sclerotic phase in which the osteoblastic activity is greatly in excess of osteoclastic resorption, leading to marked thickening of bony trabeculae and coex. New pagetic bone is structurally disorganized and more susceptible to bowing and fracture. Although most patients are asymptomatic, a variety of symptoms and complications may result directly from bony involvement or secondarily from the expansion of bone and subsequent compression of neural tissue (sensorineural hearing loss in this patient due to compression of choclear nerve from temporal bone involvement) Biochemically the increase in osteoblastic activity is reflected in elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase which can rise to extremely high values. The increase in osteoclastic bone resorption is reflected in high urinary levels of hydroxyproline, which is formed as a result of collagen breakdown. Distribution The distribution of the disease varies from monostotic involvement to widespread disease. Pelvis is the most commonly involved bone followed by femur, skull, tibia, veebrae. Clinical manifestations Asymptomatic patients are often diagnosed by discovery of an elevated alkaline phosphatase level on routine blood chemistry or from an abnormality on a skeletal radiograph obtained for other reasons. Pain is the most common presenting symptom. It occurs due to increased bony vascularity, expanding lytic lesions, fractures, bowing or other deformities of the extremities. Bowing of the femur or tibia causes gait abnormalities and abnormal mechanical stresses with secondary osteoahritis of the hip or knee joints. Back pain results due to enlarged pagetic veebrae, veebral compression fractures, spinal stenosis or kyphosis. Skull involvement may cause headache, symmetric or assymmetric enlargement of the parietal or frontal bones (frontal bossing) and increased head size Cranial expansion may narrow cranial foramine and cause neurological complications including hearing loss from choclear nerve damage from temporal bone involvement, cranial nerve palsies, and softening of the base of the skull (platybasia) and the risk of brainstem compression. Pagetic involvement of the facial bones may cause facial deformities, loss of teeth or other dental conditions. Other complications are - Fractures (most common complication) - Neoplastic transformation: development of bone sarcoma (most commonly osteosarcoma) is a rare but serious complication of Paget disease. - Cardiovascular complications: The extensive aeriovenous shunting and marked increase in blood flow through the vascular pagetic bone leads to a high output state and cardiac enlargement. Diagnosis The diagnosis may be suggested on clinical examination by the enlarged skull with frontal bossing, bowing of an extremity, or sho stature with simian posturing. A warm extremity on palpation may suggest an underlying pagetic bone Radiological findings Radiographic features depend on the stage of the disorder In the early osteolytic phase - active bone resorption is evident as a radioluscent wedged area in long bones termed as 'candle flame' or 'blade of grass'. - in the flat bones such as the calvarium or the iliac bone, purely osteolytic lesion is noted, k/a osteoporosis circumscripta Later phases of new bone formation - Bone remodelling appears radiographically as thickening of the coex, coarse trabeculation and enlargement or expansion of an entire bone or area of a long bone. - Veebral coical thickening of the superior and inferior end plates creates a 'picture frame veebra'. - Diffuse radiodense enlargement of a veebra is referred to as 'ivory veebra'. - Skull x ray shows focal patchy densities - cotton ball appearance, which is quite characteristic of Paget disease. - Pelvic radiograph demonstrate disruption or fusion of the sacro-iliac joints and softening with protrusio acetabuli - Long bones reveal bowing deformities and typical pagetic changes of coical thickening and expansion and areas of lucency and sclerosis. Biochemical findings - T alkaline phosphatase levels (indicative of osteoblastic activity, marker of bone (formation) - T Urinary hydroxyproline levels (marker of bone resorption) [The parallel rise in serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels confirm bone formation and resorption in Paget disease} The degree of bone marker elevation reflects the extent and severity of the disease. - Urinary and serum deoxypyridinoline N-telopeptide, and C-telopeptide levels are products of degradation and are more specific for bone resorption than hydroxyproline. - Serum calcium and phosphate levels are normal Treatment - Paget disease is treated with drugs which suppress the very high rates of bone resorption and secondarily decrease the high rates of bone formation Bisphosphonates - Etidronate - A lendronare - Tiludronate - Risedronate - Pamidronate Calcitonin",

Read below lines from CSDT (13/e p438) Schwartz (9/e p841): CSDT writes-\"A fundoplication may promote regression of the columnar epithelium. Many studies have shown that regression occurs in 15-50% of patients when the length of the Barrett segment is less than 3 cm. \" Schwartz writes- \"The common belief that Barrett's epithelium cannot be reversed is likely false. De. Meester and associates reported that, after antireflux surgery, loss of IM (intestinal metaplasia) in patients with visible BE was rare, but occurred in73% of patients with inapparent IM of the cardia. This suggests that the metaplastic process may indeed be reversible if reflux is eliminated early in its process, that cardiac mucosa is dynamic, and that, as opposed to IM extending several centimeters into the esophagus, IM of the cardia is more likely to regress following antireflux surgery. Gurski and colleagues reviewed pre- and posttreatment endoscopic biopsies from 77 Barrett's patients treated surgically and 14 treated with PPIs. Histopathologic regression occurred in 28 of 77 patients (36. 4%) following antireflux surgery, and in one of 14 (7. 1%) patients treated with PPlsalone (P <. 03). After surgery, regression from low-grade dysplastic to nondysplastic BE occurred in 17 of 25 (68%) patients and from IM to no IM in 11 of 52 (21. 2%) patients. Both types of regression were significantly more common in short- (<3 cm) compared to long-segment (>3 cm) BE. Although these studies do not conclusively prove the ability of antireflux surgery to reverse the changes of early BE, they do provide encouragement that, given early changes, the process may indeed be reversible. \" More about the tit of Barret's oesophagus First, the natural course of Barrett's oesophagus. - Barrett's esophagus develops during healing of erosive esophagitis with continued acid reflux and the Barrett's esophagus progresses through a dysplastic stage before developing into adenocarcinoma. The stages are - Erosive esophagitis -> Metaplasia (Barrett's esophagus) -> Low grade dysplasia -> high grade dysplaisa -> Adenocarcinoma Treatment of Barrett's esophagus is same as for reflux esophagitis -> Conservative (antacids, H2 blocking agents, elevation of the head of bed, and avoidance of smoking and alcohol etc.) and Anti-reflux surgery (Nissen's fundoplication is anti-reflux procedure of choice) As there is substantial increased risk of cancer with Barrett's esophagus, a regular follow-up with endoscopy and biopsy is done. This allows detection of cancer at an early stage with improved long-term survival after resection In the absence of dysplasia -> Surveillance endoscopy every 12-24 months. In the presence of low-grade dysplasia -> Patients with low grade dysplasia should be treated for 12 weeks with high-dose acid suppression therapy and then biopsy repeated. (the rationale for this approach is to decrease the mucosal inflammation by blocking acid secretion, allowing the pathologist a more accurate reading), If the repeated biopsy show metaplasia or high-grade dysplasia, the patient should be managed accordingly. If repeated low-grade dysplasia is seen- surveillance endoscopy is done every 6-12 months. If high grade dysplasia is detected (the diagnosis must be confirmed by two experienced pathologist) -> esophagectomy with removal of all columnar lined epithelium or if resection is not done, then the patient should be strictly followed at 3 monthly interval. If cancer is detected resection is done. Rationale for esophagectomy in high grade dysplasia is based on the following considerations- (a) cancer is already present in about 30 to 50% of patients operated for high grade dysplasia. (b) cancer develops in about 50% fo patients during follow up.)",

In contrast jerk test is a provocative maneuver for posterior gleno humeral instability. Although it is generally used to test for inferior instability (laxity), the sulcus test is also positive in many patients with multidirectional instability. Test for Evaluation of Glenohumeral Joint Instability in Recurrent Dislocation Anterior Instability * Anterior Apprehension Tests- In general these maneuver mimics the positioning of subluxation or dislocation and cause apprehension & reflex guarding.- So application of anterior directed force to the humeral head from the back and/ or abduction & external rotation of arm results in patients apprehension that the joint will dislocate. And the patient does not allow the test to be performed. Q - Variations include. 1. Apprehenson test: The patient is placed in supine position with the shoulder slightly off the table, abducted 90-100deg and in neutral rotation. Form this point, the shoulder isexternally rotated until the feeling of apprehension (getting ready to dislocate) is repoed by patient. 2. Fulcrum Test is apprehension test with a hand of examiner on posterior aspect of humerus to form a fulcrum and exaggerate instability 3. Crank Test is an apprehension test (in sitting position) with application of anteriorily directed force on posterior humeral head to exaggerate instability. 4. Surprise Test (most accurate) is another variant of apprehension test where examination stas with a posteriorly directed force on anterior shoulder. So the patient does not experienceapprehension even when the shoulder is in abduction & maximal external rotation. By abruptly removing, this (posterior) force, the patient will suddenly experience apprehension 5. Andrew's Test (e. s. p valuable in patients with possible secondary gain). This test is done by placing the patient prone with the arm abducted and externally rotated and applying anterior direction force to posterior pa of shoulder. Placing a patient in prone may eliminate the learned response to anterior apprehension testing. * lobes Relocation Test- It is similar to apprehension test, but a posteriorly directed force is placed on anterior aspect of shoulder to eliminate feeling of apprehension, at the end.- If relief is obtained by applying a posterior directed force to the humeral head the test is +ve Posterior Instability * Jerk (provocative) Test- This test can be carried out in sitting or supine position. If done in supine the shoulder is slightly off the table, in 90deg forward flexion and internal rotation. An axial load is placed on humerus (by pushing axially against the flexed elbow) such that the humeral head translocates posteriorly. By gradually adducting the shoulder, the humeral head may sublux or even dislocate posteriorly and produce in sudden jerk. When the shoulder is taken out of adduction the humeral head will abruptly reduce back onto the glenoid and produce another jerk. * Posterior Apprehension Test. Applying a posterior directed force to forward flexed & internally rotated shoulder, produce apprehension. * Posterior Clunk Test. Applying a posterior stress to forward flexed & internally rotated shoulder produce clunk as the humeral head subluxes posteriorly * Jahnke TestA posterior directed force is applied to forward flexed shoulder. The shoulder is then moved into coronal plane by applying an anterior directed force to humerus head. A clunk occurs as humral head reduces from the subluxed position. * Circumduction Test. The patient is instructed to actively move the shoulder in a large circle staing from a flexed, internally rotated, and cross body position then to forward flexion -+ then to an abducted & externally rotated position --> and lastly to the arm at the side. - The examiner stands behind and palpates the posterior shoulder. If positive the joint subluxes in the flexed, internally rotated and cross body position and reduces as the shoulder is moved. * Push - Pull Testis simultaneously pushing humeral head posteriorly (of 90deg abducted shoulder in supine position) and pulling the lower end of humerus upward (by pulling flexed elbow through long axis of forearm). This produces apprehension. Inferior Instability Sulcus Test and Sign- It is done with the arm in both 0 degrees & 45 degrees of abduction by pulling the extermity distally and observing for a sulcus or dimple between humeral head & acromian. - Subluxation at 0 degree of abduction is more indicative of laxity at the rotator interval & subluxation at 45 degree is indicative of laxity of inferior gleno- humeral ligament complex. * Shift & Load Test observes amount of anterior & posterior translation of humeral head, in 0deg abduction.* Shoulder Lachman and Drawer Test also measures amount of anterior & posterior translation* Dugas, Callaway & Hamilton ruler (Mn \"DCH\") tests are positive in (already) dislocated shoulder.",

The condition is most commonly seen at 4 wks after birth ranging from the 3rd wk to on rare occasion, the 7th. However, 20% of infants are symptomatic from birth, and most are symptomatic within the first 2 months after birth. Non-bilious vomiting, becoming increasingly projectile, occurs over several days to weeks. Eventually the infant will develop a nearly complete obstruction by the second to fourth week of life and will not be able to hold down even clear liquids. This invariably proceeds to severe dehydration if not t/t. These infants develop a metabolic alkalosis with severe depletion of potassium and chloride ions. \" The diagnosis of pyloric stenosis usually can be made on physical examination by palpation of the typical 'olive' in the right upper quadrant and the presence of visible gastric waves on the abdomen.

They may be relative or absolute contraindications. They can be considered relative, if the contraindication is provided with additional care, one can overcome the complication. In other words, given the situation, the patient is made fit to undergo extraction, once the underlying condition is treated. On the contrary, there are a few conditions which are absolute contraindications. These factors will be the impediments for extraction, even if care is taken. If extraction is carried out in the presence of such absolute contraindications, the outcome may be even fatal. Hence, it is essential to differentiate between these two types of contraindications. To avoid legal consequences, it is preferable to avoid extraction, if the contraindication is absolute. The contraindications may also be classified as systemic or local factors. The presence of absolute systemic contraindications indicates that this group of diseases exists in an uncontrolled state. No attempt should be made by the dental surgeon to thrust extraction on such patients. By doing so the clinician will be inviting disaster, e. g. metabolic disorders like uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled cardiac problems, leukemia, renal failure and liver disorders like cirrhosis of liver. Local contraindications: The most common local contraindication is an ongoing acute inflammatory or infectious process. The acute infection/inflammation should first be treated before proceeding with the extraction, depending on the location of the acute process. Extraction of a third lower molar during an ongoing acute pericoronitis could lead to a lifethreatening postoperative infection. However, there are also situations where an acute abscess is best drained by extraction of the tooth even in an acute phase. An acute infectious process caused by pulpal disease is resolved most quickly by extraction of the tooth. Therefore an acute infectious and inflammatory process should not be considered as an absolute contraindication for extraction",

Total paralysis of the nerve, including those branches of the nerve serving the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, causes wasting along medial side of forearm. Paralysis of the nerve also leads to weakness of flexion of fouh and fifth fingers; if proximal poions of these fingers are held steady, patient is unable to flex terminal phalanges. With paralysis of hypothenar muscles, abduction of fifth finger is impossible. Paralysis of interossei and medial two lumbricals causes 'claw hand' deformity, mainly seen in the ulnar fingers. There may be wasting of hypothenar muscles, interossei and medial pa of thenar eminence. Also there is weakness in movement of fingers and abduction to the extended thumb against the palm. There is sensory loss of the dorsal and palmar aspects of the medial side of the hand together with the medial one and a half fingers. With compression of the ulnar nerve, the ulnar nerve is often palpably enlarged in the ulnar groove and for a sho distance proximal to the elbow. II. Lesion at the wrist Cutaneous sensation of hand and fingers is often spared. If lesion is just proximal to the wrist, it causes impaired sensation on the palmar aspects of hand and the fouh and fifth fingers and muscle weakness, especially in the hypothenar eminence. Adductor pollicis will be injured in ulnar nerve injuries so patient will hold the book by using the flexor pollicis longus (supplied by median nerve). This is the basis of book test/froment sign.

The newest addition, a fusion PET-CT scan, allows for detection of metastatic deposits and has added tissue-based resolution of CT scan.

Anorectal angle distributes intraabdominal forces onto the pelvic floor and play an impoant role in the continence mechanism.

The internal & external sphincters are tonically active at rest. - the internal sphincter is responsible for most of the resting, involuntary sphincter force - the external sphincter is responsible for voluntary sphincter force. Both the internal and external sphincters are innervated by pudendal nerve. Finally, the hemorrhoidal cushions may contribute to continence by mechanically blocking the anal canal.

Vas deferens carries the sperms from epididymis to the urethra where they open by separate openings into the prostatic urethra. Just before opening each vas deferens is joined by ducts of seminal vesicles. Vas deferens and seminal vesicle ducts join to form the ejaculatory duct. The secretions of seminal vesicles form a large part of seminal fluid and contain fructose and a coagulating enzyme called the vesiculase. Now coming to the question. Semen analysis forms an important part of infertility assessment. Low ejaculatory volume is caused by retrograde ejaculation into the bladder or obstruction of the vas deferens or the ejaculatory duct Azoospermia may be seen in testicular failure or obstruction of vas deferens Absence of fructose suggests seminal vesicles agenesis or obstruction. A semen that is low in volume with azoospermia and absence of fructose suggests -> either obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts or congenital absence of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles. The anatomy of the vas deferens & seminal vesicles can be investigated by vasography (where contrast medium is injected into the vas deferens) or TRUS (Trans rectal ultrasonography), however TRUS is superior to vasography and is the investigation of choice. Also know Semen specimen should be obtained following at least 3 days of abstinence and examined within 1 to 2 hrs. At least 2 specimens are examined several weeks apart.",

Two techniques are commonly used to measure the lung volumes. - Helium dilution method. - Body plethysmography. Helium dilution method In the helium dilution method, the subject repeatedly breathes in and out from a reservoir with a known volume of gas containing a trace amount of helium. The helium is diluted by the gas previously present in the lungs and very little is absorbed into the pulmonary circulation. From knowledge of the reservoir volume and the initial and final helium concentrations, the volume of the gas present in the lungs can he calculated. The helium dilution method may underestimate the volume of gas in lungs if there are slowly communicating airspaces such as bullae. In this situation, lung volumes can be measured more accurately with a body plethysmography a sealed box in which patient sits while panting against a closed mouthpiece. Because there is no airflow into or out of the plethysmography the pressure changes in the thorax during panting cause compression and rarefaction of gas in the lungs and simultaneous rarefaction and compression of gas in the plethysmograph. By measuring the pressure changes in the plethysmograph and at the mouthpiece the volume of gas in the thorax can he calculated using Boyle's law.",

Synol fluid: Is a plasma transudate from synol capillaires + hyaluronic acid- protein complex (mucin) secreted by Type B synol cells + cells (60-100 cells/ml; mainly lymphocytes and monocytes) The viscous and lubricating propey of the synol fluid is attributed to hyaluronic acid.

Examples of Newtonian fluid are: water, oils, gases, mercury, alcohol etc. A Non-Newtonian fluid is one that does not follow the Newtonian (friction) law. Its viscosity changes with agitation or varying shear rate. A Non-Newtonian fluid can be Thixotropic or Rheopectic. Thixotropic is one whose viscosity decreases with agitation or varying shear rate. (Thus thixotropic fluid are thick (viscous) under normal conditions, but become thin, less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.) Eg. Synol fluid, ketchup. Rheopectic is one whose viscosity increases with agitation or varying shear rate. Eg. gypsum pastes, printers inks, and some lubricants. Synol fluid has thixotropic propeies. Its viscosity decreases with increase in the rate of movement, thus it is able to provide better lubrication to the joints.",

Kaposi's Sarcoma (K. S.) Kaposi's Sarcoma is a multicentric neoplasm consisting of multiple vascular nodules appearing in the skin, mucous memb and lymph nodes, lung, GIT etc. Lesions often appear in sun-exposed areas, paicularly the tip of the nose, and have a propensity to occur in areas of trauma (Koebner phenomenon) Course ranges from indolent with only minor skin or lymph node involvement to fulminant with extensive cutaneous and visceral involvement. AIDS related kaposi's sarcoma occurs predominantly in homosexual men (96%) K. S. does not result from a neoplastic transformation of cells in the classic sense and so is not truly a sarcoma. It is a manifestation of excessive proliferation of spindle cells that are believed to be of vascular origin. it is more a consequence of disordered cytokine regulation of cell growth than a true cancer. Generally speaking the tumor respects tissue planes and is rarely invasive. Disseminated K. S. is believed to be d/t occurence of multiple neoplasm all over the body rather than to metastasis. Though K. S. is an oppuunistic ds in HIV-infected individuals but unlike oppounistic infection, its occurance is not strictly related to the level of depression of CD4+T cells counts. It may be seen at any stage of HIV inf even in the presence of normal CD4+T cell count. Human Herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) is universally present in all forms of KS (in all the 4 types) In constrast to most maligancies, in which lymph node involvement implies metastatic spread and a poor prognosis, lymph node involvement may be seen very early in KS. and is of no clinical significance. Management of KS associated with HIV In the majority of cases, effective ARV therapy is quite helpful in achieving control. Spontaneous regressions have been repoed in the setting of HAA. For patients in whom tumor persists or in whom control of HIV replication is not possible options exist. Treatment is indicated under two main circumstances. 1) For a single lesion or a limited number of lesions causing significant discomfo or cosmetic problems localized radiation, intralesional vinblastine, or cryotherapy 2) For large number of lesions or visceral invlovement Systemic therapies, either IFN- or chemotherapy is considered Interferon- IFN provides an added advantage of having ARV activity; thus, it may be the appropriate first choice for single-agent systemic therapy for early patients with disseminated disease. Chemotherapy- Three of the chemotherapeutic agent that have been approved by the FDA for KS are: - liposomal daunorubicin, - liposomal doxorubicin, and - paclitaxel Liposomal daunorubicin is approved as first-line therapy for patients with advanced KS. The single most impoant determinant of response appears to be the CD4+ T cell count.",

Positive pressure ventilation (adjusting the ventilator settings, to avoid barotraumas) to 'internally splint' the chest until fibrous union of the broken ribs occur. It is usually reserved for cases developing respiratory failure despite adequate analgesia and oxygen. Chest tubes as required. Adjustment of position to make the patient most comfoable and provide relief of pain. Surgical fixation is usually not required, but may be done in selected patients with isolated or severe chest injury. A patient may be intubated with a double lumen tube. In a double lumen endotracheal tube, each lumen is connected to a different ventilator.

The risk of malignant degeneration is related to both the size and type of polyp. Majority of colorectal carcinomas evolve from adenomatous polyps; this sequence of events is the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Hamaomatous Polyps (Juvenile Polyps) In contrast to adenomatous polyps, hamaomatous polyps (juvenile polyps) are not usually premalignant. These lesions are the characteristic polyps of childhood but may occur at any age. Inflammatory Polyps (Pseudopolyps) Inflammatory polyps occur most commonly in the context of inflammatory bowel disease, but may also occur after amebic colitis, ischemic colitis, and schistosomal colitis. These lesions are not premalignant. Hyperplastic Polyps Hyperplastic polyps are the most common colonic polyps, but they are usually quite small (Ninety percent of these polyps are less than 3 mm in size) These lesions are not premalignant. Adenomatous polyps have special clinical significance because only adenomatous polyps are clearly premalignant, and only a minority of these adenomatous lesions ever develop into a cancer. Clinically, the probability of an adenomatous polyp becoming a cancer depends on three factors 1) Gross appearance of the lesion --> on gross appearance polyps are of two types a) Pedunculated (stalked) b) Sessile (flat based) Cancer develops more frequently in sessile polyps. 2) Histologically --> Histologically polyps are of 3 types a) Tubular b) Villous (papillary) c) Tubulovillous Out of these histological types villous adenomas which are usually sessile become malignant more than 3 times as often as tubular adenomas.",

This loss of bone mass means there is an increasing likelihood of fracture with increasing age. Due to the accelerated loss of bone mass following the menopause, elderly women are at a higher risk of osteoporosis than men. There are numerous risk factors for the development of osteoporosis. Among them are Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups, female sex, increasing age, early menopause, smoking, excess alcohol, coicosteroid use, hypogonadism and rheumatoid ahritis. The reduced bone mass of osteoporosis may result in veebral crush fractures, the majority of which are asymptomatic. The extent of osteoporosis is best investigated with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. This gives a T score, which is the number of standard detions the patient's bone mineral density differs from the population average for a young healthy adult. The World Health Organization defines osteoporosis as a T score of -2. 5 or greater (i. e. the bone mineral density of more than 2. 5 standard detion below that of the average for a young healthy adult). A T score of between -1. 5 and -2. 5 is defined as osteopenia. Spinal x-rays (A) are useful to assess veebral crush fractures but cannot assess extent of osteoporosis. Full blood count, bone and liver biochemistry tests (C) are not affected by osteoporosis, making this answer incorrect.

Best seen following re-location of the joint, and better appreciated on internal rotation views. It appears as a sclerotic veical line running from the top of the humeral head towards the shaft. If large then a wedge defect may be evident. CT and MRIBoth MRI and CT are very sensitive to this lesion, which appears as a region of flattening or a wedge shaped defect (with bone marrow oedema on MRI acutely) seen involving the posterolateral humeral head above the level of the coracoid. This is usually seen in the most superior few slices, were the humeral head should be rounded. It is impoant to note that below the level of the coracoid the humeral head normally flattens out posterolaterally, and this should not be misinterpreted as a Hill-Sachs lesion",

Crystalloids are aqueous solutions of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules. Colloids contain larger insoluble molecules, such as albumin; blood itself is a colloid. Colloids preserve a high colloid osmotic pressure in the blood, while, on the other hand, this parameter is decreased by crystalloids due to hemodilution. Another difference is that crystalloids generally are much cheaper than colloids. The most commonly used crystalloid fluid is normal saline, a solution of sodium chloride at 0. 9% concentration, which is close to the concentration in the blood (isotonic). Ringer's lactate or Ringer's acetate is another isotonic solution often used for large-volume fluid replacement.

Duodenal switch The surgical treatment of morbid obesity is known as bariatric surgery. Morbid obesity is defined as body mass index of 35 kg/m2 or more with obesity related comorbidity, or BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater without comorbidity. Bariatric operations produce weight loss as a result of 2 factors. One is restriction of oral intake. The other is malabsorbtion of ingested food. Gastric restrictive procedures include Veical banded gastroplasty & Adjustable gastric banding. Malabsorbtive procedures include Biliopancreatic diversion, and Duodenal switch. Roux-en Y gastric bypass has features of both restriction and malabsorption. Veical Banded Gastroplasty This procedure has now largely been abandoned in or of other operations because of high rate of stenosis of the gastric outlet and poor long term weight loss. Adjustable Gastric Banding A silicone band is put around the proximal stomach to restrict the amount of solid food that can be ingested at one time. The adjustable nature of the band allows the amount of restriction to be increased or decreased, depending upon the patient's weight loss. Gastric band placement, unlike malabsorptive weight loss surgery (e. g. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RNY), Biliopancreatic Diversion (BPD) and Duodenal Switch (DS)), does not cut or remove any pa of the digestive system. It is also usually easy to remove the band and reverse the surgery, requiring only a laparoscopic procedure. after which the stomach usually returns to its normal pre-banded state. Roux-en Y Gastric Bypass A gastric bypass first divides the stomach into a small upper pouch and a much larger, lower \"remnant\" pouch. Next the jejunum is divided and the lower pa of the small intestine is then attached to the new stomach pouch thus bypassing most of the stomach and the upper pa of small intestine. RYGB is thus both a gastric restrictive procedure and a mildly malabsorbtive procedure. Biliopancreatic Diversion BPD produces weight loss based primarily on malabsorption but it does have a mild restrictive component. Pa of the stomach is resected (Distal hemigastrectomy), creating a smaller stomach. The distal pa of the small intestine is then connected to the pouch, bypassing the duodenum and jejunum. The intestinal tract is reconstructed is a fashion to allow only a sho so-called common channel of the distal 50 cm of terminal ileum for absoption of fat and protein. Duodenal Switch This is a modification of the Biliopancreatic Diversion procedure developed to lessen the high incidence of marginal ulcers after BPD. The mechanism of weight loss is similar to that of BPD. The major difference between DS and BPD is the gastrectomy and the proximal anatomy. Instead of a distal hemigastrectomy, a",

Radiographs show no abnormalities, since positioning for elbow films will often reduce the subluxation. Reduction is achieved by firmly supinating the forearm and flexing the elbow while pressing down on the radial head. Often, a \"click\" is felt when reduction is achieved. Soon after reduction the child becomes less apprehensive and gradually resumes use of the arm. Ref: Srinivasan R. C., Tolhurst S., Vanderhave K. L. (2010). Chapter 40. Ohopedic Surgery. In G. M.

In ceain situations, selective angio embolism of the spleen can play a role''. Splenic injuries are treated nonoperatively, by splenic repair (splenorrhaphy), paial splenectomy, or resection, depending on the extent of the injury and the condition of the patient. Enthusiasm for splenic salvage has been driven by the evolving trend toward nonoperative management of solid organ injury and the rare but often fatal complication of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI ). It is uncommon in otherwise healthy adults. For this reason attempts to salvage the spleen are more vigorous. Splenectomy is also indicated for lesser splenic injuries in patients who have developed a coagulopathy and have multiple abdominal injuries, and it is usually necessary in patients with failed splenic salvage attempts. Paial splenectomy can be used in patients in whom only a poion of the spleen has been destroyed, usually the superior or inferior half. Splenic trauma: The spleen is the most commonly injured organ in cases of blunt abdominal trauma. Nonoperative management is the treatment of choice Splenic injuries in children have been managed traditionally without surgery. Until recently, most splenic injuries in the adults were managed with splenorrhaphy or splenectomy. Currently., 50-80% of adults with blunt splenic injuries are managed non operatively. Stable patients who have high-grade splenic injuries on CT or have evidence of ongoing bleeding on CT may be candidate for angiographic embolisation. Unstable patients with splenic injuries should undergo splenectomy or attempts at splenic repair if appropriate. \"Ballance's sign: A palpable tender mass can be felt in the left upper quardant with persistent dullness.

They include a long face, large ears, prominent jaw, macroorchidism, hypotonia, repetitive speech, gaze avoidance, and hand flapping. Even in the absence of physical findings, boys of all ages with developmental delay, autism, and abnormal temperament of unknown cause probably should be tested for the fragile X syndrome. The genetics of the fragile X syndrome are unique. Most males who carry the fragile X mutation are mentally impaired and show the clinical phenotype; however, 20% of males who inherit the genetic mutation are normal in intelligence and physical appearance. They are also cytogenetically normal in that the fragile site on their X chromosome is not seen by the karyotyping method. These normal transmitting males (NTMs) transmit the fragile X mental retardation (FMR-1) gene to all of their daughters and often have severely affected grandchildren. It is thought that a premutation carried by these NTMs must go through oogenesis in their daughters to become a full mutation. Daughters of NTMs are usually normal but are obligate carriers of the FMR-1 gene. Daughters who inherit the gene from the mother are mentally retarded about one-third of the time. Because both males and females can be affected, the fragile X syndrome is best described as a dominant X-linked disorder with reduced penetrance in females. Cytogenetic testing for the fragile site on the X chromosome is an unsatisfactory method of identifying persons with this mutation for the following reasons: (1) not all cells in the affected males show the fragile site, (2) NTMs have no fragile X site demonstrable by this method, and (3) a significant percentage of carrier females are cytogenetically normal. In 1991, the FMR-1 gene was cloned. Direct DNA analysis is now available for diagnosis of phenotypically affected persons as well as suspected carriers of fragile X; it can also",

Triangle of doom: Triangle of doom is formed by the gonadal vessels laterally and the vas deferens medially. Both these entities meet at the deep inguinal ring and the base of triangle is formed by the peritoneal reflection. This triangle contains external iliac artery and vessels.

Bhadury 1/e p193-196] Though IV disc space can be preserved in less common types of TB spine, in the most common (approx 98%) paradiscal variety of TB spine, IV disc space is always involved. \"A radiographic finding of destruction of the veebra along with diminution of the interveebral disc space is considered pathognomic of tuberculosis. \"- T. B. Of Ohopedics By Kotwal 2005/e p91 As a rule neoplastic and traumatic/osteoporotic collapse show sparing of the interveebral disc. Common neoplasms in adult causing veebral collapse are metastasis and multiple myeloma, while in children veebral collapse may indicate histiocytosis (veebra plasm). Disc space narrowing is seen in degenerative diseases and infection of the disc space. Types of spinal tuberculosis Paradiscal (most common type; approx 98% - Ref' Ebnezar 3/e p503): In this the contiguous areas of two adjacent veebrae along with the intervening disc are affected. There is an embryological basis for this type of involvement. A veebra develops from sclerotomes which lie on either side of the notochord. Each pair of sclerotome develops into the lower half of the veebra above, upper half of the veebra below and the intervening IV disc; and has a common blood supply. Therefore hematogenous infections involve this `embryological' section as a whole. Central body type: In this type the central body of the veebra is involved which may lead to veebral collapse. IV disc space is normal. Anterior type: Here the disease stas at the anterior pa of the body and spreads up and down under the anterior longitudinal ligament. Posterior type: Here the posterior complex of the veebra i. e. the pedicle, lamina, spinous process or the transverse process is affected.",

C: Cleft lip and cleft palate The typical distribution of cleft types is: Cleft lip alone-15% Isolated cleft palate-40% Cleft lip and cleft palate-45% Cleft lip alone (hare lip): It is due failure of fusion between the frontonasal (philtrum) and the maxillary processes. Types: - Unilateral 85% usually on the left side 75%, bilateral 15%. - Upper or lower: lower cleft lip is very rare and is due to failure of fusion between the mandibular processes. Complete or incomplete: according to whether it extends to the nostrils or not. - Simple or alveolar: if it involves the bony alveolus. - Complicated or not: If it is associated with cleft palate. Complications: - Disfigurement. - Difficult suckling if it is complicated. Treatment: - Timing of surgery for cleft lip alone: Unilateral-one operation at 5-6 months Bilateral-One operation at 4-5 months. - (Millard's operation- When the patient is 10 weeks old, Hb = 10 gm% and the weight is 10 pounds (rule of ten)). II. Isolated cleft palate: The palate is developed from - Premaxilla from the frontonasal process. - Two maxillary shelves: from the maxillary process Cleft palate occurs due to failure (total or paial) of fusion between the maxillary and frontonasal process or the 2 maxillary processes. Types: - Soft palate only, usually asymptomatic. - Intermaxillary: the cleft is only between the 2 maxillary shelves. - Bipaate: as intermaxillary but extends to one side of the premaxilla. Tripaate: as intermaxillary but extends to both sides of the premaxilla. Complications: - Impaired feeding due to: Difficult suckling. Wide pharynx: so the soft palate can't close the nasopharynx during swallowing leading to nasal regurgitation of food, leading to pharyngitis, rhinitis, otitis media and deafness. Difficult speech: specially consonant e. g. D, P, T, B, K, J. - Teeth malformation. Pierre Ribon syndrom: Cleft palate with receding lower jaw (micrognathia) and posterior displacement of the tongue which obstruct air way. - Malformed nose. Treatment: In cases of cleft palate alone, surgical correction is indicated Soft palate only-One operation at 6 months Soft and hard palate-Two operations. One for soft palate at 6 months and another for hard palate at 15-18 months. - In case of cleft lip and palate, surgical correction is done at; Unilateral- two operations-Cleft lip and soft palate at 5-6 months and hard palate and gum pad with or without lip revision at 15-18 months.

It's the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. Male to female ratio is 3: 2. Approximately 60% of Meckel's diverticula contain heterotopic mucosa, of which more than 60% consists of gastric mucosa. Second most common ectopic mucosa is that of Pancreas (Pancreatic acini). Other mucosa are \u00adcolonic mucosa, Brunner's gland, pancreatic islets, endometriosis and hepatobiliary tissue. A useful but crude Mnemonic used traditionally for describing Meckel's diverticula is Rule of two: i. e. 2% prevalence 2 inch in length 2 feet proximal to the ilcocecal valve. half of these who are symptomatic are younger than 2 yrs of age Meckel's diverticula are asymptomatic. Symptoms arise only when any complication occurs. Complications Most common complication in children & young adults (< 18 yrs of age) -> bleeding in adults -> intestinal obstruction overall -> bleeding Following complications are noted in Meckel's diverticulum. Bleeding bleeding in Meckel's diverticulum is usually the result of ulceration in ileal mucosa adjacent to the diverticulum caused by the acid secreted by heterotopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum. Intestinal obstruction Intestinal obstruction associated with Meckel's diverticulum can result from several mechanisms. Volvulus of the intestine around the fibrous band attaching the diverticulum to the umbilicus Intussusception with the diverticulum acting as the lead point. Entrapment of intestine by a mesodiverticular band (the Mesodiverticular band is a remnant of the left vitelline artery, it tethers the Meckel's diverticulum to the ileal mesentery.) Stricture secondary to chronic diverticulitis. Diverticulitis clinical picture is similar to appendicitis. diverticulitis may lead to perforation. Littre's hernia - rarely Meckel's diverticulum is found in an inguinal or a femoral hernia. This is known as Littre's hernia. Diagnostic studies Meckel's diverticulum in the absence of bleeding can be rarely diagnosed before surgical intervention. Barium meal follows through can rarely demonstrate the diverticulum. Barium enteroclysis can demonstrate the diverticula in 75% of cases but is avoided during the acute presentation of complication. If repeated episodes of lower GI bleed occur and an ectopic gastric mucosa in the Meckel's diverticulum is suspected, it can be demonstrated by Technetium99 pertechnate radionuclide scan. It demonstrates the ectopic gastric mucosa and localizes the Meckel's diverticulum. Angiography can localize the site of bleeding during acute hemorrhage related to Meckel's diverticula.",

MRI of the brain shows dilatation of the ventricular cavities, while the cerebral coex appears normal. No infarcts are seen. Repeated lumbar punctures reveal occasional increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. A biopsy of the frontal coex demonstrates the absence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",
        "exp": "This is an \"interdisciplinary\" question, which begins with a clinical scenario and ends by testing your knowledge of pathophysiology and pharmacology. The clinical presentation has the classic triad of memory loss, urinary incontinence, and gait abnormalities characteristic of normal pressure hydrocephalus (recently renamed intermittently raised pressure hydrocephalus). This condition results from intermittent increases in CSF pressure, leading to progressive damage to cerebral white matter and dilatation of the ventricles. No significant coical atrophy is present. The lack of Alzheimer-related changes in the biopsy and the measurements of CSF pressure suppo the diagnosis. Relief of CSF pressure can be obtained by placing a ventricular shunt, which usually improves clinical symptomatology. Tacrine and other inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase are used in the symptomatic therapy of Alzheimer disease. The pathology of this disease includes degeneration of cerebral cholinergic systems, such as the basal nucleus of Meyne, which project to the neocoex and are involved in memory and learning. Acetylcholinesterase degrades acetylcholine after release from presynaptic boutons. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors therefore enhance the concentration of acetylcholine and amplify cholinergic neurotransmission. Aspirin is used to prevent aggregation and adhesion of platelets in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. Prophylactic aspirin treatment lowers the incidence of transient ischemic attacks and brain infarcts. L-DOPA is a precursor of dopamine, the neurotransmitter of the nigrostriatal neurons that degenerate in Parkinson disease. L-DOPA, especially in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, is therefore used in the treatment of this disorder. Ref: Ropper A. E., Ropper A. H. (2012). Chapter 209.

The application of a heating pad helps allete the discomfo. As her obstetrician, what do you tell this patient is the most likely etiology of this pain?",
        "exp": "(Gabbe, 2/e, pp 227. Cunningham, 21/e, pp 43, 1281.) The patient is giving a classic description of round ligament pain. Each round ligament extends from the lateral poion of the uterus below the oviduct and travels in a fold of peritoneum downward to the inguinal canal and inses in the upper poion of the labium majus. During pregnancy, these ligaments stretch as the gravid uterus grows fuher out of the pelvis and can thereby cause sharp pains, paicularly with sudden movements. Round ligament pain is usually more frequently experienced on the right side due to the extrorotation of the uterus that commonly occurs in pregnancy. Usually this pain is greatly improved by avoiding sudden move- ments and by rising and sitting down gradually. Local heat and analgesics may also help with pain control. The diagnosis of appendicitis is not likelybecause the patient is not experiencing any fever or anorexia. In addition, because the gravid uterus pushes the appendix out of the pelvis, pregnant women with appendicitis often have pain located much higher than the groin area. The diagnosis of preterm labor is unlikely because the pain is localized to the groin area on one side and is alleted with a heating pad, which would not be the case with labor contractions. In addition, when labor occurs, the pain would persist at rest, not just with movement. A urinary tract infection is unlikely because the patient has no urinary symptoms. A kidney stone is unlikely because usually the patient would complain of pain in the back, not low in the groin. In addition, with a kidney stone the pain would not only occur with movement, but would persist at rest as well",

        "question": "All of the following are true regarding medullary carcinoma of thyroid except: March 2010",
        "exp": "Ans. C: TSH dependent. Medullary tumors are the third most common of all thyroid cancers (about 5 to 8 percent). Unlike papillary and follicular thyroid cancers which arise from thyroid hormone producing cells, medullary cancer of the thyroid originates from the parafollicular cells (also called C cells) of the thyroid. These C cells make a different hormone called calcitonin. High levels of serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen are produced by many medullary tumours. Levels falls after resection and rise again with recurrence making it a valuable tumour marker in the follow-up of patients with this disease. This cancer has a much lower cure rate than does the \"well differentiated\" thyroid cancers (papillary and follicular), but cure rates are higher than they are for anaplastic thyroid cancer. Sporadic- Accounts for 80% of all cases of medullary thyroid cancer. They are typically unilateral and there are no associated endocrinopathies (not associated with disease in other endocrine glands. Peak onset 40 - 60. Females outnumber males by 3: 2 ratio. One third will present with intractable diarrhea. Diarrhea is caused by increased gastrointestinal secretion and hypermotility due to the hormones secreted by the tumor (calcitonin, prostaglandins, serotonin, or VIP). MEN H-A (Sipple Syndrome). Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndromes are a group of endocrine disorders. Sipple syndrome has bilateral medullary carcinoma or C cell C cell hyperplasia, pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism. This syndrome is inherited and is due to a defect of a gene (DNA) which helps control the normal growth of endocrine tissues. This inherited syndrome is passed on to all children who get the gene (inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion). Males and females are equally affected. Peak incidence of medullary carcinoma in these patients is in the 30's. MEN II-B. This syndrome also has medullary carcinoma and pheochromocytoma, but only rarely will have hyperparathyroidism. Instead these patients have an unusual appearance which is characterized by mucosal ganglioneuromas (tumors in the mouth) and a Marfanoid habitus. Inheritance is autosomal dominant as in MEN II-a, or it can occur sporadically (without being inherited). MEN II-B patients usually get medullary carcinoma in their 30's, and males and females are equally effected. As with MEN II-A, pheochromocytomas must be detected prior to any operation. The idea here is to remove the pheochromocytoma first to remove the risk of severe hypeensive episodes while the thyroid or parathyroid is being operated on. Inherited medullary carcinoma without associated endocrinopathies. This form of medullary carcinoma is the least aggressive. Like other types of thyroid cancers, the peak incidence is between the ages of 40 and 50. Involvement of lymph nodes occurs in 50-60% of cases of MCT and blood-borne metastases are common.

Ultrasonography will confirm a solid testicular mass. The tumor markers b-HCG and a-fetoprotein are not used in the initial evaluation of a scrotal mass, but may be impoant when a solid mass suggestive of testicular carcinoma is found. b-HCG or AFP will be elevated in about 70% of patients with disseminated nonseminomatous testicular cancer. Seminomas are usually associated with normal tumor cell markers. Choriocarcinomas produce b-HCG. Endodermal sinus tumors or embryonal cell carcinomas are often associated with elevated AFP levels. The lymphatic drainage of the testis is into the periaoic nodes, not to the inguinal nodes.

Severe intra-abdominal sepsis, such as an infected Caesarean section, typhoid peritonitis, or a perforation of his large gut. Suturing of abdomen with catgut or some other absorbable suture, especially of low quality or out of date, or if abdominal wound becomes infected. Suturing in layers, taking bites of tissue that are too small. Patient is having carcinomatosis, uraemia, or obstructive jaundice. An abdomen will almost never burst if: It is sutured with a non-absorbable suture, such as steel, nylon, or polyethylene. Close its muscles with one layer of through-and-through sutures, which are not too tight and with wide bites of tissue. Use delayed skin suture if the wound is infected or potentially so. The three main post-operative causes are abdominal distension, intestinal leakage and wound infection. Leakage is impoant as it will nearly always lead to wound disruption. A serosanguinous (pink) discharge from the wound is forerunner of disruption in 50% of cases. It is the most pathognomonic sign of impending wound disruption and it signifies that intraperitoneal contents are lying extraperitoneally.",

Gene defects result in. fallure to synthesize a functional protein or in the synthesis of a dysfunctional protein. Equipping the cell with a normal copy of the defective gene would overcome the deficieny at the site where it is needed on a long term. Approaches in gene therapy:? Gene therapy tries to either modify or transfer the genes. Gene modification This involves correction of the defective poion of a genomic sequence or removal of the whole defective gene and its replacement by a normal copy. Gene transfer This involves introduction of genes without removing or altering the existing ones. Gene transfer is carried out in the following ways? i) Injection of naked D. N. A. ii) Transfer of generic material using virus as a carrier with D. N. A. incorporated into its genome. iii) Transfer of D. N.
