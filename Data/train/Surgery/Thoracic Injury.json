        "question": "A patient after road traffic accident presented with tension pneumothorax. What is the first line of management?",
        "exp": "Ans. a. Insert wide bore needle in 2nd intercostal space (Ref: Sabiston 19/e p1599; Schwartz 9/e p138; Bailey 25/e p342). First line of management in tension pneumothorax: Insert wide bore needle in 2nd intercostal space. 'Treatment of tension pneumothorax consists of immediate decompression by rapid insertion of a large-bore needle into the 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular lineQ of the affected hemithorax. 'This case is a classical description of tension pneumothorax of right hemithorax with decreased breath sounds and shock. Since patient is shouting it means her airway is clear. Immediate decompression with large bore needle in mid clavicular line in 2nd intercostal space is the urgent treatment for this patient followed by insertion of IV line and fluid administration. Tension PneumothoraxA tension pneumothorax develops when a 'one-way valve' air leak occurs either from the lung or through the chest wallQ. Air is forced into thoracic cavity without any means of escape, completely collapsing the affected lungQ. Mediastinum is displaced to the opposite side, decreasing venous return and compressing the opposite lungQ. Common Causes of Tension Pneumothorax* Penetrating chest traumaQ* Blunt chest traumaQ (with parenchymal injury & air leak that did not spontaneously close)* Iatrogenic lung punctures (e. g. due to subclavian central venepuncture)* Mechanical positive pressure ventilation. QClinical Features: Clinical presentation is dramatic. The patient is panicky with tachypnoea. dyspnoea and distended neck veins (similar to pericardial tamponade)Q. Clinical examination can reveal tracheal deviation (a late finding - not necessary' to clinically confirm diagnosis), hyperresonance and absent breath sounds over the affected hemithoraxQ. Diagnosis: Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis and treatment should not he delayedQ by waiting for radiological confirmation. Treatment: Treatment consists of immediate decompression by rapid insertion of a large-bore needle into the 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular lineQ of the affected hemithorax. This is immediately followed by insertion of a chest tube through the 5th intercostal space in the anterior axillary lineQ. If the tension in the pleural space is not relieved, the patient is likely to die from inadequate cardiac output or marked hypoxemiaQ.",

        "question": "A case of spontaneous pneumothorax comes to you what will be earliest t/t of choice:",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' ie Needle aspiration Pneumothorax: is the presence of gas in the pleural space. Types: Spontaneous pneumothorax - is one that occurs without antecedent trauma to the thorax. Primary spontaneous - Occurs in the absence of an underlying lung disease (usually d/t apical plural blebs). Secondary spontaneous - d/t an underlying lung disease. Traumatic pneumothorax - results from penetrating or non penetrating injuries to the chest. Tension pneumothorax - Any pneumothorax in which the pressure in the pleural space is positive throughout the respiratory cycle. In this pt. its not specified the type of spontaneous pneumothorax, still lets see the t/t. Treatment. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax -Initial recommended treatment is simple aspiration. If the lung does not expand with aspiration, or if the pt. has a recurrent pneumothorax, thoracoscopy with stapling of blebs and pleural abrasion is indicated (100% success rate). Secondary Spontaneous pneumothorax. Sec. spon. pneumothorax can occur in any lung ds but are commonly seen in COPD. Nearly all pts are t/t with tube thoracostomy and the instillation of a sclerosing agent such as doxycycline or talc. Pts. with persistent air leak, an unexpanded lung after 3 days of tube thoracostomy, or a recurrent pneumothorax should be subjected to thoracoscopy with bleb resection and pleural abrasion. Traumatic pneumothorax. Traumatic pneumothorax should be t/t with tube thoracostomy unless they are very small. If a hemopneumothorax is present, one chest tube should be placed in the superior part of the hemithorax to evacuate the air, and another should be placed in the inferior part of the hemithorax to remove the blood. Tension pneumothorax. It is an emergency situation. A large bore needle is inserted into the pleural space through the Second anterior intercostal space. The needle should be left in place until a thoracostomy tube is inserted. I assume that the pt. has primary spontaneous pneumothorax as there is no past history of any disease (as it is not mentioned in the question).",
