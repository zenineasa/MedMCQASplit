Possible cells of origin include the epidermal MC, a dermal MC equivalent, a neural-crest- derived cell of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) system, and a residual epidermal stem cell. o. Cytogenetic abnormalities are present in 30-47% of MCCs. The most frequent change is loss of heterozygosity due to translocations or deletions of chromosome 1; specifically, 2 distinct regions in the most distal band 1 p36 on the sho arm of chromosome 1are implicated in MCC. Similar abnormalities near this site occur in several neuro cystic tumors, including melanoma, neuroblastoma, and pheochromocytoma. Other abnormalities described in MCC include losses at chromosomes 3, 13, and 22 and paial trisomy 01 chromosomes 1, 11, 18, and X. Unlike neuroendocrine (small cell) carcinoma of the lung, gene amplifications are rare in cutaneous MCC. o. Cytokeratin 20 is expressed in a dot like paranuclear or crescentic pattern; other low molecular weight (MW) cytokeratin antibodies (E. g., CAM5. 2, MNF116), white less specific, react in a similar localization pattern. o. Electron microscopic findings are char9- cteristic, revealing a lobulated nucleus that may contain rodlets. The cytoplasm is electron- lucent and contains a prominent Golgi apparatus and numerous ribosomes. Intermediate filaments are numerous and often assume a parallel or whorled arrangement near the nucleus, accounting for the dot like pattern of cytokeratin distribution visualized by immunohistochemistry. Desmosomes may be present. Most diagnostic is the dense core granule (80-120 mn in diameter), the source and the locus of the neuroendocrine peptides.",

Longitudinal: * The longitudinal is one where fracture line runs parallel to the Petrous ridge, that is longitudinal axis of the bone. it constitutes 85% of all the Temporal Bone. 23% are bilateral. Fracture begins in Squamous Temporal Bone & continues towards the Petrous apex, coursing around the dense Otic capsule bone. Hearing loss is common after the injury; it is usually mixed hearing loss. * These invariably results in laceration of the roof of the External Auditory Canal and often the tympanic membrane blood from the middle ear appears in the of External Auditory Canal, leading to a-dictum, that bloody Otorhea after head injury usually represents a longitudinal temporal bone until proved otherwise. If the Dura is disrupte CSF may leak through a disrupted Tegmen Tympani, resulting in CSF Otorrhea. * Spontaneous Nystagmus is Rare. * Facial N. is usually spared * Most extends along the Fallopian Canal rather than across it. Facial weakness after this is usually incomplete and is most often delayed, secondary. to the edema rather than disruption of the nerve. b. Transverse: * This runs right angle to the longitudinal axis of the Petrous bone. * Caused by: - Blow on the Occipul or less commonly a direct frontal blow. Transverse has a higher moality than longitudinal and greater force is required to generate them. * The \"Classical' Transverse begins in Posterior Cranial Fossa, usually in the region of Foramen Lacerum or Foramen Spinosum. * The hearing loss in transverse is usually Sensorineural, caused by disruption of the integrity of the labrynth or the neurovascular bundle in the internal auditory canal. Veigo with spontaneous Nystagmus & post traumatic common after it. Facial n. paresis is also common (50%), it is immediate and greater intensity than longitudinal.

D: Hernia occurring at the level of arcuate line Spigelian hernia is an acquired ventral hernia through the linea semilunaris, the line where the sheaths of the lateral abdominal muscles fuse to form the lateral rectus sheath, at the level of arcuate line. Spigelian hernias are nearly always found above the level of the inferior epigastric vessels. Commonly, the patient is over the age of 50 years. Men and women are equally affected. The patient presents with pain that is localised to the hernial site and is aggravated by any movement that raises intraabdominal pressure. Later, the pain becomes more dull, constant, and diffuse. A soft, reducible mass may be present in the lower abdominal area which disappears on pressure. When the mass is reduced, the hernial orifice can usually be palpated. Diagnosis is more difficult when the hernia dissects within the layers of the abdominal wall - internal and external obliques - or may be located at a distance from the linea semilunaris. Ultrasound and CT scan may help to confirm the diagnosis.",

C: Prepatellar Bursa Prepatellar bursitis, also known as Housemaid's knee, is a common cause of swelling and pain above the patella, and is due to inflammation of the prepatellar bursa. This structure is a superficial bursa with a thin synol lining located between the skin and the patella. The bursa develops within the first years of life as a result of mechanical pressure and friction, and it serves the purpose of reducing friction on underlying structures and allowing maximal range of motion in the knee. Aseptic prepatellar bursitis is commonly caused by repetitive work in a kneeling position, hence the name \"housemaid's knee",

Total paralysis of the nerve, including those branches of the nerve serving the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, causes wasting along medial side of forearm. Paralysis of the nerve also leads to weakness of flexion of fouh and fifth fingers; if proximal poions of these fingers are held steady, patient is unable to flex terminal phalanges. With paralysis of hypothenar muscles, abduction of fifth finger is impossible. Paralysis of interossei and medial two lumbricals causes 'claw hand' deformity, mainly seen in the ulnar fingers. There may be wasting of hypothenar muscles, interossei and medial pa of thenar eminence. Also there is weakness in movement of fingers and abduction to the extended thumb against the palm. There is sensory loss of the dorsal and palmar aspects of the medial side of the hand together with the medial one and a half fingers. With compression of the ulnar nerve, the ulnar nerve is often palpably enlarged in the ulnar groove and for a sho distance proximal to the elbow. II. Lesion at the wrist. Cutaneous sensation of hand and fingers is often spared. If lesion is just proximal to the wrist, it causes impaired sensation on the palmar aspects of hand and the fouh and fifth fingers and muscle weakness, especially in the hypothenar eminence.

        "question": "In nonunion of scaphoid vescularized muscle pedicle graft is taken from.",
        "exp": "C i. e. Pronator quadrates Blood supply of scaphoid enters distally mainly through the dorsal ridge (spiral groove, narrow non aicular region in the waist) and proximal segment is supplied by retrograde intraosseous blood flow from distal to proximal. This unusual pattern of vascularity is responsible for higher probability of nonunion & avascular necrosis of proximal fragment in fractures of scaphoid. Therefore 0-1% of distal third, 20% of middle third, 40% of proximal third and 100% of proximal pole fractures result in AVN and nonunion. Scaphoid Fracture Functional Anatomy & Epidemiology Scaphoid is the most commonly fractured bone in the - carpusQ, in adult as well as children. However unlike in adults and adolescents, the fracture is rare in young children. (d/t cailagenous nature of carpal bones in children) Scaphoid fracture is seen most commonly in males between the ages of 15 and 30. (adolscents & adults)Q - Scaphoid may be divided into proximal, middle and distal thirds. The middle third is termed the waist. The scaphoid tubercle forms the distal volar prominence. Middle third (Waist) fractures are most commonQ accounting for - 70% of scaphoid fractures > proximal pole fracture (20%) > distal pole fracture (10%), in adults & adolescents. Investigation Distal pole avulsion type fracture is most common fracture type in children Q. Anteroposterior, lateral and oblique views are all essential; often a recent fracture shown only in the oblique viewQ. So a routine scaphoid x- ray series must include:- Radial and ulnar deton PA views with the wrist in about 30deg of extension (by asking to make a fist gently) True lateral view Radial oblique (supinated PA) view and ulnar oblique (pronated PA) view. Comparison view of opposite wrist. However it is common for the fracture not to be visible on the initial films. If doubt exists, the scaphoid should be immobilized in plaster and repeat radiograph obtained in 1421 days as the late films are usually positiveQ. Bone scan, trispiral tomography are other investigations; occult scaphoid fractures can be reliably diagnosed by MRI & nucleotide scan. Vascularity, Nonunion & AVN Blood supply of scaphoid is precarious. It receives most of its blood supply from two major vascular pedicles (dorsal & volar branches) from the radial aery, both entering distallyQ. Volar (palmar) scaphoid branch of radial aery enters the scaphoid tubercle and supplies its distal 20-30%. Dorsal scaphoid branch of radial aery enters through numerous small foramina along the spiral groove & dorsal ridge and account for 80% of its blood supply. There is usually no or rarely a single perforater proximal to the waist of scaphoid. Hence vascularity of proximal fragment is maintained by retrograde intraosseous blood flow from distal to proximal; 7080% of which is provided by dorsal branch. The distal scaphoid has a dense vascular network whereas intraosseous vascular density declines proximally, leaving the proximal pole with sparse blood supply. Because of this unusual retrograde vascular supply to proximal segment, the scaphoid has a high risk of nonunion and AVN after fracture through waist and proximal pole. Because the scaphoid aiculates with four carpal bones & radius, most of its surface is composed of aicular cailage. Therefore, the vascular supply comes through -a narrow non aicular region in the waist. Most of the blood supply to the scaphoid enters distally, so blood supply of scaphoid diminishes proximallyQ. This accounts for the fact that 1% of distal third, 20% of middle third, 40% of proximal third and 100% of proximal pole fractures result in avascular necrosis or non union of the proximal fragment2. -Because it aiculates with distal radius, and with 4 of remaining 7 carpal bones, the scaphoid moves with nearly all carpal motions, especially volar flexion. Any alteration of its aicular surface through fracture, dislocation, or subluxation or any change of its stability by ligamentous rupture can cause severe secondary changes throughout the entire carpus. Management Stable and undisplaced fractures are treated by scaphoid cast immobilization (glass holding dorsal and radial flexion positionQ impacts the scaphoid fragments and minimises the shearing effects), for 4 - 8 weeks in distal third, 6 - 12 weeks in middle third and 12- 20 weeks in proximal third fractures. Scaphoid cast is applied from the upper forearm to just sho of meta carpophalyngeal joints of fingers, but incorporating proximal phalynx of thumb. The wrist is held dorsiflexed and the thumb forwards in \"glass holding position\" - A displaced fracture, by definition, is one with > 1 mm of step-off or >60degof scapholunate or >15deg of lunato- capitate angulation. The subtle signs of displacement or instability are - opening & obliquity of fracture line, angulation of distal fragment, and fore shoening of scaphoid image. Displaced- unstable fractures are treated by percutaneous screw fixation or OR & IF by k - wires, compression screw or Herbe screw. - Undisplaced ununited (nonunion) fractures may be treated by excavation of the scaphoid & placement of volar inlay coicocancellous bone graft (Matti Russe procedure). In most cases of stable nonunion cancellous bone graft from either the distal radius (for small defects) or the iliac crest (preferable because of its superior osteogenic and mechanical propeies) is packed into the defect. Dorsal cailage is not disturbed. This provides a hinge and facilitates assessment of scaphoid length. If fracture site is angulated or collapsed coico cancellous volar graft is employed to correct the deformity. If the proximal pole is avascular and no significant radiocarpal ahritis is present, revascularization of the scaphoid with a vascularized bone graft from dorsal radius or preferably pronator quadratus graftQ should be performed. Paial radial stylodectomy should be performed in all patients with radiological signs of stage I radioscaphoid ahritis limited to scaphoid and radial styloid. - Once degenerative ahritis is evident at the radio -carpal joint, salvage procedures includes proximal row carpectomy, scaphoid excision and mid carpal ahodesis or total wrist ahrodesis. Clinical Presentation - The patient is usually and adolescent boy or young adult who gives a h/o falling on outstretched hand usually during active spos. Commonly the injury is misinterpreted as \"just a sprain\". Like colle's it is a supination - dorsiflexion injury. - Fullness & tenderness in anatomical snuff boxQ. Radial side wrist pain; passive dorsiflexion to the radial side is painful, grip is weak and release of grip gives transitory pain, resisted pinch between the thumb and index finger is uncomfoable. Proximal pressure along the axis of the thumb may be painfulQ.",

Silent chest is a paicularly ominous finding, because the airway constriction is so great that airflow is insufficient to generate wheezing. Hypercapnia and thoraco- abdominal paradox are almost always indicative of exhaustion and respiratory muscle failure or fatigue and generally need to be aggressively treated with mechanical ventilation. An increased pulsus paradoxus may also be a sign of severe asthma, as it increases with greater respiratory effo and generation of more negative intrathoracic pressures during inspiration However, a pulsus paradoxus of up to 8 to 10 mm.

Which of the following drugs most likely aggravated this fasting hypoglycemia?",
        "exp": "Glyburide Glyburide is a second-generation sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic. Of the main groups or chemical classes of oral antidiabetic agents, these are the ones typically associated with causing hypoglycemia, whether from overdose or as a rather expected response in some patients, paicularly before meals. Normally carbohydrates from a meal trigger insulin release; when blood glucose levels are low, as after the 18-h fast this patient experienced, physiologic insulin release would be low too. However, even in a fast-induced hypoglycemic state a sulfonylurea will release insulin and drive blood glucose down even fuher. The elderly are paicularly susceptible to sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. Pa of this may relate to diet. However, expected age-related falls of renal and/or hepatic function can reduce elimination of these drugs, thereby increasing their serum levels and their effects unless dosages are reduced accordingly. This propensity for preprandial hypoglycemia is shared by the meglitinides, repaglinide and nateglinide because they, too, increase pancreatic insulin release. The thiazadolinediones (glitazones) seldom cause symptomatic hypoglycemia because they do not release insulin. The same applies to metformin, the biguanide; and acarbose (with, along with miglitol, is an aglucosidase inhibitor). Because of a longer half-life, compared with glipizide, a sulfonylurea is more likely to cause preprandial hypoglycemia. Glipizide is contraindicated in patients with liver disease because it is metabolized in the liver. Care should be taken in the elderly because of their propensity to develop hypoglycemia, which is perhaps due to decreased hepatic and renal function that is evident in this patient population. Metformin, acarbose, and pioglitazone do not produce serious hypoglycemic reactions.",

Most common age group affected is 5-8 years. Boys are affected more than girls. Left side is more common than right. Mechanism of injury Mostly it occurs due to hyperextension injury. Fracture is caused by a fall onto the outstretched hand with hyperextension at elbow. Types of supracondylar fracture Supracondylar fracture is broadly classified into extension type and flexion type. 1) Extension type It is the most common type (97 - 99%). Distal fragment is extended (tilted backward/posteriorly) in relation to proximal fragment. Occurs due to hyperextension injury after fall on outstretched hands. Generally, displacement of distal fragment may be: - i) Posteromedial (70-80%) ii) Posterolateral (20-30%) 2) Flexion type It is less common type (1-3 %) Distal fragment is flexed (tilted forward/anteriorly) in relation to proximal fragments. The mechanism of injury generally is believed to be a fall directly onto the elbow rather than a fall on outstretched hand. As the extension type fracture is more common (97 - 99%), the most common elbow injury in children is extension type of supracondylar fracture. Clinical features of supracondylar fracture Following a fall, the child is in pain and elbow is swollen. In extension type of injury, `S' shaped deformity of the elbow is obvious. There is loss of both active and passive movements of elbow. Symptoms relating to vascular and nerve injury may be seen. Unusual posterior prominence of the point of elbow (tip of olecrenon) because of backward tilt of the distal fragment. Three point bony relationship is maintained as the fracture is above the level of condyles. Dimple sign due to one of the spikes of proximal fragment penetrating the muscle and tethring the skin.",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Pseudohyperophied Duchenne muscular dystrophy is by far the most common childhood-onset muscular dystrophy, afflicting 1 in 3300 boys with an overall prevalence of 63 cases per million. One third of these cases are due to spontaneous mutations, while the rest are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Duchenne muscular dystrophy clinically manifests in patients aged 3-7 years, with development of lordosis, a waddling gait, and the Cowers sign. Calf pseudohyperophy follows 1-2 years later. Most patients are wheelchair bound by age 12 years. Diagnostic criteria include: Weakness with onset in the legs; Hyperlordosis with wide-based gait; Hyperophy of weak muscles; Progressive course over time; Reduced muscle contractility on electrical stimulation in advanced stages of the disease; and (6) absence of bladder or bowel dysfunction, sensory disturbance, or febrile illness. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is much more than a disease of skeletal muscles. Dystrophin is also found in the heart, brain, and smooth muscle. Late-stage cardiac fibrosis can lead to output failure and pulmonary congestion, a common cause of death. Additionally, cardiac fibrosis can include cardiomyopathy and conduction abnormalities, which can induce fatal arrhythmias.",

It can be measured by holding a hand higher than heart-level (prevents venous reflux), pressing the soft pad of a finger or toe until it turns white, and taking note of the time needed for the color to return once pressure is released. Normal refill time is less than 2 seconds. In newborn infants, capillary refill can be measured by pressing on the sternum for five seconds with a finger or thumb, and noting the time needed for the colour to return once the pressure is released. The upper normal limit for capillary refill in newborns is 3 seconds. The capillary refill time (C) is a common indication of dehydration and decreased peripheral perfusion. It is very useful as suppoing evidence for a positive sign of poor perfusion to the extremities. The C test is often referred to as the Nail blanch test.

Dysplasia of the wing of the sphenoid bone, results in poor formation of the wall and/or floor of the orbit.

LES comprises the lower 4 cm of esophagus, where resting pressure within the lumen normally exceeds the intragastric pressure. This high intraluminal pressure at LES prevents the GE reflux. The LES is a physiological entity rather than any anatomical structure. Factors contribute to the high intraluminal pressure of LES: Intrinsic musculature of distal esophagus: these muscles differ from those in the other area of the esophagus in that they are in a state of tonic contraction. They normally relax with initiation of the a swallow and then return to a state of tonic contraction. Sling fibres of cardia Crura of the diaphragm Intra Abdominal pressure: the intra abdominal pressure compresses the abdominal segment of the esophagus and is probably the most impoant factor in preventing the reflux. The gastroesophageal angle: the oblique entry of the esophagus has a valvular effect, in that it closes the esophagus when gastric fundus distends. Folds of the mucosa at the cardia: helps in closing the LES when intragastric pressure arises. Intrathoracic pressure has no role in preventing reflux as it is too low ranging from -5 to + 5mm of Hg Ref: Sabiston 18/e, Page 1108; Essential of Surgery By Sunil Chumber 1/e, Page 7; Textbook of Surgery By S.

The translocation places the myc oncogene on chromosome 8 downstream of the very active heavy chain locus on chromosome 14, activating myc gene expression in B cells and their derivatives. The translocation is likely an aberrant form of the normal DNA rearrangements that generate unique heavy chain genes in each B cell. The translocation joins one chromosome 8 to one chromosome 14, leaving their homologues unaffected. The cause for the phenotype must therefore be trans-acting, since cis-acting effects would peain only to the translocated loci and not affect the homologous untranslocated loci. Activation of a tumor-promoting gene (oncogene) on chromosome 8 could produce an enlarged tonsil, while underactivity of immunoglobulin production due to one-half expression could decrease immune function but would not completely ablate the processes in choices a, b, d, and e. At the genetic level, trans-acting events are autosomal dominant in that one of the two homologous loci is abnormal and produces a phenotype.

The Lachman test is the most sensitive examination maneuver for evaluating a anterior cruciate ligament tear. The test is performed with the knee flexed to 30 degrees and the tibia is translated anteriorly with respect to the femur. It is positive if there is increased translation as compared to the opposite side, or more translation than normal. Note: The lateral collateral ligament originates on the lateral femoral epicondyle and inses on the head of the fibula. It functions to prevent varus instability of the knee. When a varus stress (adducted) is placed on the tibia, the lateral collateral ligament becomes taut and prevents displacement. The medial collateral ligament originates from the medial femoral epicondyle and inses on the medial proximal tibia. Its function is to prevent valgus instability of the knee. When a valgus stress is placed on the tibia, the medial collateral ligament is stressed and prevents displacement. The patellar ligament runs from the inferior pole of the patella to the tibial tubercle, and is commonly referred to as the patellar tendon. However, this structure connects bone to bone, which is the definition of a ligament, not a tendon. Ref: Textbook of Ohopaedics & Trauma Vol 1 Page 2940.",

Clinical Features] \u2022 Clinical presentation: Chest pain and dysphagia (may be related to eating or exertion and may mimic angina) \u2022 Complain of a squeezing pressure in the chest that may radiate to the jaw, arms, and upper back. \u2022 The symptoms are often pronounced during times of heightened emotional stress. Diagnosis \u2022 Barium swallow: -- Corkscrew or rosary-bead esophagus, segmental spasm or pseudodiverticulosis appearance -- Due to presence of tertiary contractions -- Indicative of advanced disease \u2022 Hypermotility disorder also known as supersqueeze esophagus. \u2022 Esophagus with hypertensive peristalsis or high-amplitude peristaltic contractions. \u2022 Most common and most painful esophageal hypermotility disorder. \u2022 Associated with hypertrophic musculature resulting in high-amplitude contractions of the esophagus Clinical Features \u2022 Chest pain and dysphagia are typical symptoms. Diagnosis \u2022 The gold standard of diagnosis is the subjective complaint of chest pain with simultaneous objective evidence of peristaltic esophageal contractions 2 standard deviations above the normalQ values on manometric tracings. \u2022 On manometry, amplitude >180 mm. Hg and duration of contraction >6 seconds Treatment \u2022 The treatment of nutcracker esophagus is medical (Calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and antispasmodics) \u2022 The LES pressure is above normal, motility of esophageal body may be hyperperistaltic or normal. Clinical Features \u2022 Patients with hypertensive LES present with chest pain or dysphagiaQ. Diagnosis \u2022 Diagnosis is made by manometry. -- Elevated LES pressure (>26 mm Hg) and normal relaxation of the LES. -- Esophageal body may be hyperperistaltic or normal.

If a non union allows for too much motion along the fracture gap, the central poion of the callus undergoes cystic degeneration and luminal surface can actually become lined by synol like cells, creating a false joint filled with clear fluid.

        "question": "Rx of choice in postoperative lung collapse is -",
        "exp": "\"The most common postoperative respiratory complication is atelectasis. As a result of the anaesthetic, abdominal incision, and postoperative narcotics, the alveoli in the periphery collapse and a pulmonary shunt may occur. If appropriate attention is not directed to the aggressive pulmonary toilet with the initial symptoms, the alveoli remain collapsed and a buildup of secretions occurs and becomes secondarily infected with bacteria. The risk appears to be particularly high in patients who are heavy smokers, are obese, and have copious pulmonary secretions. Pneumonia may develop early (i. e., 2-5 days after admission to the hospital) or late (i. e., >5 days) and is referred to as health care-related pneumonia. Aspiration of oropharyngeal and gastric contents is the leading cause of health care-related pneumonia. Presentation and Management The most common cause of a postoperative fever in the first 48 hours after the procedure is atelectasis. The patients have a low-grade fever, malaise, and diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields. Very often the patient is uncomfortable from the fever but has no other overt pulmonary symptoms. Atelectasis is so common postoperatively that a formal workup is not usually required. However, if not aggressively managed, frank development of pneumonia is likely. A patient with pneumonia, on the other hand, will have a high fever, occasionally mental confusion, and the production of a thick secretion with coughing, leukocytosis, and a chest radiograph that reveals infiltrates. If the condition is not expeditiously diagnosed and treated, the patient may rapidly progress to respiratory failure and require intubation. Prevention of atelectasis and pneumonia is associated with pain control, which allows the patient to take deep breaths and cough. A patient-controlled analgesia device seems to be associated with better pulmonary toilet, as does the use of an epidural infusion catheter, particularly in patients with epigastric incisions. Respiratory care, otherwise, begins preoperatively. The patient must be instructed in the use of the incentive spirometer and be held accountable by nurses and physicians during rounds. Encouraging the patient to cough while applying counter pressure with a pillow on the abdominal incision site is most helpful. Rarely, other modalities such as intermittent positive pressure breathing and chest physiotherapy may be required. Encouraging the patient to breathe deeply and cough is the single most valuable management approach in preventing and resolving atelectasis and pneumonia. Patients in whom pneumonia develops in the postoperative period are managed with aggressive pulmonary toilet, induced sputum for culture and sensitivity testing, and empirical broad-spectrum IV antibiotic therapy while awaiting culture results. Once the organisms are cultured from sputum, a specific antibiotic must be used as indicated. \"",

        "exp": "* The uncomplicated acid-base disorders, which may be of metabolic or respiratory origin, are classified as being metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, or respiratory alkalosis. The pH (normal 7. 38 to 7. 44) determines whether the primary process is an acidemia (pH < 7. 38) or an alkalemia (PH > 7. 44). (Note that compensation for an alkalosis is always acidosis, while compensation for acidosis is always alkalosis, but in either case, compensation does not bring the pH into the normal range.) * Bicarbonate levels in metabolic acidosis are <21 mM, while those in metabolic alkalosis are >28 mM. Similarly, with respiratory disorders, examine the Pac02 (normal PC02 is 35 to 40 mm. Hg aerial, 40 to 45 mm. Hg venous). in patient with respiratory alkalosis the Pac02 is <35, while with respiratory acidosis the Pac02 is >40. * Patients with metabolic alkalosis lose acid, and this causes an increase in the blood pH the body compensates for - this increased pH by decreasing the respiratory rate, which increases blood CO2 levels (hypercapnia) and increases the renal excretion of bicarbonate. Causes of metabolic alkalosis include vomiting (losing gastric acid), increased aldosterone secretion (which causes increased excretion by the kidneys), and ceain diuretics. * In contrast, metabolic acidosis increases serum acid (increased hydrogen ion concentration), which decreases serum pH and decreases serum bicarbonate concentration. The causes of metabolic acidosis are broken down clinically into two groups: those with a normal anion gap and those with an increased anion gap. (The serum anion gap is found by taking the serum sodium concentration and subtracting the concentration of two anions, namely chloride and bicarbonate. * Normally, the anion gap is between 10 and 16 meq/L.) Increased anion gaps result from increased unmeasured anions, such as may occur in the following clinical situations: ketoacidosis (increased beta- hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid, seen with diabetic ketoacidosis); lactic acidosis (hypoxic conditions); chronic renal failure (uremia); and ingestion of ceain substances such as salicylates, ethylene glycol, methanol, and formaldehyde. * A normal anion gap metabolic acidosis may result from either loss of bicarbonate (diarrhea) or loss of renal regeneration of bicarbonate, seen with renal tubular acidosis type 1 (decreased excretion of titratable acid, i. e., NH and renal tubular acidosis type 4. * In a patient with metabolic acidosis, the body tries to combat the decreased pH by increasing the respiratory rate (tachypnea), which helps to raise the pH by blowing off CO2 and decreasing the serum CO2 (hypocapnia). The body also compensates through renal mechanisms that increase H excretion and increase bicarbonate reabsorption.",

They can be hard to distinguish from the inguinal type (especially when ascending cephalad): however, they generally appear more rounded, and, in contrast to inguinal hernias, there is a strong female preponderance in femoral hernias. Although inguinal hernia may be 10 times more common than the femoral hernia, a femoral hernia is more likely to strangulate because of the narrowness of the neck and its rigid sorrounds.

Appendectomy. Obstruction in a patient with malrotation can occur because of mid gut volvulus or because of bands (Ladd's band). Midgut volvulus can occur at any age, although it is seen most often in the first few weeks of life. ilious vomiting is usually the first sign of volvulus, and all infants with bilious vomiting must be evaluated rapidly to ensure that they do not have intestinal malrotation with volvulus. When volvulus is suspected, early surgical intervention is done to avoid or reverse the ischemic process. Surgery: Volvulus occurs clockwise, and it is therefore untwisted counterclockwise. (This can be remembered by using the memory aid \"Turn back the hands of time. \") Subsequently, Ladd's procedure is performed. This operation does not correct the malrotation but does broaden the narrow mesenteric pedicle to prevent volvulus from recurring. Steps done in Ladd's procedure are: duodenal and cecal bands are divided, Broadening of the mesentery The appendix is removed to avoid diagnostic errors in later life. This maneuver brings the straightened duodenum into the right lower quadrant and the cecum into the left lower quadrant. Note that: A subset of patients with malrotation can also present with incomplete obstruction or chronic obstruction. (so the patient here in this question has either incomplete volvulus or obstruction because of duodenal band) Ladd' s procedure is performed to prevent voluvulus; however, volvulus can still occur rarely after Ladd's procedure.",

        "exp": "Enterococcus Enterococci cause a wide variety of infections ranging from less serious--for example, urinary tract infections--to very serious, such as septicemia. A gram-positive coccus resistant to penicillin must be assumed to be entero coccus until other, more definitive biochemical testing places the isolate in one of the more esoteric groups of gram-positive cocci. Once isolated, there are a variety of tests to speciate enterococci. However, penicillinresistant, non_ vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive cocci are most likely E. faecium. There are a variety of mechanisms for vancomycin resistance in E. faecium and they have been termed Van A, B, or C. These isolates have become one of the most feared nosocomial pathogens in the hospital environment. Unfounately, no approved antibiotics can success fully treat vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)--only some experimental antibiotics such as Synercid.",

D: Valgus Stress Test Tests to Detect Ligament Injury Lachman Test - The Lachman test is the best test to diagnose an ACL tear. - With the patient lying flat and relaxed, the examiner bend the knee slightly, about 20 degrees. The examiner then stabilizes the thigh while pulling the shin forward. - Both the amount of translation (shifting) as well as the feel of the endpoint offer information about the ACL. Anterior Drawer Test - The anterior drawer test is also performed with the patient lying flat. The knee is bent 90 degrees and the shin is pulled forward to check the stability of the ACL. - An intact ACL will only allow the shin to come forward slightly. - A torn ACL will allow the shin to move fuher forward. Pivot Shift Test - The pivot shift test is a difficult maneuver to perform on a patient who is not under anesthesia. This test places a stress on the knee joint that forces a subluxation (paial dislocation) in patients who do not have an ACL. - This test recreates the type of instability that caused the ACL injury. Posterior Drawer Test - The posterior drawer is performed similarly to the anterior drawer test. - This test detects injury to the PCL. - By pushing the shin backward, the integrity of the PCL is tested. - Excessive movement of the shin backwards is a sign of PCL injury. Varus and Valgus Instability - Varus and valgus instability tests check the LCL (lateral collateral ligament) and MCL (medial collateral ligament), respectively. - With the patient lying flat, and the knee held at about 30 degrees of flexion, gentle adduction and abduction force is applied. - Insufficiency of the LCL or MCL will allow the knee to \"open up\" excessively. - The test is repeated with the leg straight. If the knee still opens up excessively, then more than just the LCL or MCL was torn.",

With the advent of CT scanning, nonoperative management of solid organ injuries has replaced routine operative exploration. Those patients who do require operation may be treated with less radical resection techniques such as splenorrhaphy or paial nephrectomy. Colonic injuries, previously mandating colostomy, are now repaired primarily in viually all cases. Additionally, the type of anastomosis has shifted from a double-layer closure to a continuous running single-layer closure; this method is technically equivalent to and faster than the interrupted multilayer techniques. Adoption of damage control surgical techniques in physiologically deranged patients has resulted in limited initial operative time, with definitive injury repair delayed until after resuscitation in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) with physiologic restoration. Abdominal drains, once considered mandatory for parenchymal injuries and some anastomoses, have disappeared; fluid collections are managed by percutaneous techniques. \"",

The values generated by the test can then be compared to both: Young adult population: called a \"T score\", this test measures the variance between the patient and the young adult baseline. A score above -1 is considered normal; a score between -1 and -2. 5 is considered osteopenia; and a score below -2. 5 is considered osteoporosis. For each -1 standard detion in T score there is a 3 times increased risk of hip fracture and a 2. 5 times risk of spine fracture. Age-and gender-matched control groups: a \"Z score\" measures the variance between the patient's and control groups' amount of bone.

The pulse strikes the palpating finger with a rapid, forcefid jerk and quickly disappears. It is best felt in the radial aery with the patients arm elevated. It is seen in Aoic regurgitation. Pathophysiology of water hammer pulse In Aoic regurgitation the stroke volume is high, so the systolic pressure is high and this is responsible for sharp rise in the pulse. The stroke volume is high because the left ventricle gets blood from two sources during the diastole i. e. blood leaking from the Aoa and the blood it receives from left atria. The collapse occurs because Diastolic leak of blood into the left ventricle from the Aoa Rapid run off to the periphery as a result of low systemic vascular resistance (the increased cardiac output stimulates the baroreceptors in the aoic arch and the result is reflex vasodilatation of the peripheral vessels into which the blood flows rapidly). Wiry are arms elevated in the examination? When the arm is raised there is fall of blood column resulting in vasodilation and thus helps to reduce the diastolic pressure more, so the pulse pressure widens. It may be so that the aery palpated becomes more in the line of Aoa after elevation of the arm and thus allows the direct systolic ejection and diastolic backward flow.",

A: MRI Scan Avascular necrosis/ osteonecrosis/ aseptic (bone) necrosis/ ischemic bone necrosis is a disease resulting from the temporary or permanent loss of the blood supply to the bones. Without blood, the bone tissue dies and causes the bone to collapse. There are many causes of avascular necrosis such as: Alcoholism Excessive steroid use Post trauma Caisson disease (decompression sickness) Vascular compression Vasculitis Thrombosis Damage from radiation Bisphosphonates (paicularly the mandible) Sickle cell anemia Gaucher's Disease Idiopathic (no cause is found). Rheumatoid ahritis and lupus are also common causes of AVN. Avascular necrosis most commonly affects the head of femur. Other common sites include the talus, scaphoid and the jaw. Avascular necrosis usually affects people between 30 and 50 years of age. When it occurs in children at the femoral head, it is known as Legg-Calve-Pehes syndrome. It is most oftenly diagnose clinically. Because early X-rays are usually normal in the early stage of the disease, bone scintigraphy and MRI are the diagnostic modality of choice since both can detect minimal changes at early stages of the disease.

Tachycardia, with or without tachy apnea may be the 1 st or only sign of early compensated shock\". Shock is an acute dramatic syndrome characterized by the inadequate circulatory supply of oxygen so that the metabolic demands of vital organs and tissues are not met. Shock has been categorized into a series of the recognizable stage: - Compensated Uncompensated Irreversible An initial insult triggers shock, thus disrupting blood flow to end organs leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. The body9s compensatory mechanism is initiated to maintain perfusion to vital organs. If treatment is not introduced during this period, decompensated shock develops causing tissue damage that leads to multisystem organ dysfunction and death. Compensatory shock In the early phases of shock, multiple compensatory physiologic mechanisms act to maintain blood pressure and preserve tissue perfusion. Blood pressure remains normal, initially, because of peripheral vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance. Thus hypotension occurs late and is more a characteristic of the uncompensated stage of shock Patients in compensated shock have relatively normal cardiac output and normal blood pressures but they have an alteration in microcirculation that increases flow to some organs and reduce flow to other. In infants, compensatory increases in cardiac output are achieved primarily by \"tachycardia\" rather than by an increase in stroke volume. Heart rates of 190-210/min are common in infants with compensated shock. On the other hand in older patients, cardiac contractility (stroke volume) and (heart rate) increase to improve cardiac output",

Abnormalities involving any of these normal metabolic pathways may lead to the accumulation of triglycerides within the hepatocytes. This accumulation of triglycerides is called fatty change or steatosis. Examples of abnormalities that produce hepatic steatosis include diseases that cause excess delivery of free fatty acids to the liver or diseases that cause impaired lipoprotein synthesis. Excess delivery of free fatty acids occurs in conditions that increase lipolysis of adipose tissue, such as starvation, diabetes mellitus, and coicosteroid use. Increased formation of triglycerides can result from alcohol use, as alcohol causes excess NADH formation (high NADH/NAD ratio), increases fatty acid synthesis, and decreases fatty acid oxidation. Impaired apoprotein synthesis occurs with carbon tetrachloride poisoning, phosphorous poisoning, and protein malnutrition. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity is the mechanism of lovastatin, which indirectly increases liver LDL receptors and increases LDL clearance from the blood.",

Rapid exposure of these vessels can be accomplished during abdominal trauma by following maneuvers: - The principle behind visceral rotation is to rotate the viscera of one side towards the midline after freeing their lateral peritoneal attachments so as to expose the vessels of that side A left medial visceral rotation (Mattox maneuver) provides excellent exposure of the aoa, coeliac axis, superior mesentric aery, left renal aery and iliac aeries. A right medial visceral rotation (Catell maneuver) readily exposes the vena cava (with a combined Kocher maneuver), right renal vessels and iliac veins. The infrarenal aoa may be approached a transperitoneal incision at the base of the mesocolon. The junction of the superior mesentric, splenic and poal veins can be readily exposed in trauma surgery by dividing the neck of the pancreas.

Bilateral hydronephrosis \"Surgery should be recommended for patients who continue to be bothered by their symptoms or who experience urinary retention despite medical therapy. Surgery should also be recommended for patients with upper tract dilation, renal insufficiency secondary to BPH, or bladder stones. \"- Schwaz 8/e p1530. About other options: Prostate Size: Treatment of BPH is primarily dictated by patient's symptoms and not by the prostate size. However the size of prostate can decide whether to go for endoscopic method of treatment or open surgical procedure. Open surgery is more effective than endoscopic methods for prostates weighing >100gm (ref: Schwaz 9/e p1471; Smith's Urology 17/e p354)UTI: Recurrent episodes of UTI (and not a single episode) are an absolute indication for surgery of prostate. Hypertension: Alpha blockers which are first line medical therapy for BPH lower the blood pressure and thus are helpful in hypeensive persons. Management of BPH Management is primarily directed by symptoms. Mild symptoms can be managed with watchful waiting. More severe symptomatic patients are treated with medicines (alpha blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors or combination of both). Surgery is recommended if the paient is having problems despite medical therapy. Absolute indications for surgery as listed in Smith's Urology is given below. Absolute indications for surgical treatment of BPH1) Refractory urine retention (failing at least one attempt at catheter removal)2) Recurrent UTI from BPH3) Bladder stones d/t BPH4) Renal insufficiency d/t BPH5) Large bladder diveicula secondary to BPH6) Recurrent gross hematuria from BPHUpper tract dilatation is an indication for surgery according to Schwaz. Medical therapy. Alpha-blockers (terazosin, doxazosin, and tamsulosin). Alpha-blockers help is reducing the symptoms of BPH by blocking the alpha 1 adrenoreceptors present in human prostate and bladder base. 5-Alpha-reductase inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride)? 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. This thus results in reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptoms (after several months of use). Surgery. Surgery for BPH is most commonly performed endoscopically; however, if the prostate gland is quite large (approx >100 g), an open prostatectomy should be performed. The standard endoscopic procedure for BPH is a transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate. Conventional surgical methods: Transurethral resection of the prostate (most commonly used method). Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP). Open simple prostatectomy (simple suprapubic prostatectomy, simple retropubic prostatectomy)?- When the prostate is too large to be removed endoscopically, an open enucleation is necessary. What constitutes\"too large\" is subjective and varies depending upon the surgeon's experience with TURP. Glands >100 g areusually considered for open enucleation. Open prostatectomy may also be initiated when concomitant bladderdiveiculum or a bladder stone is present or if dorsal lithotomy positioning is not possible.- Open prostatectomies can be done with either a suprapubic or retropubic approach. A simple suprapubic prostatectomy is performed transvesically and is the operation of choice in dealing with concomitant bladder pathology. Minimally invasive methods: 1. Laser therapy (Nd: YAG and holmium: YAG ). Transurethral electrovaporization of the prostate. Microwave Hypehermia. Transurethral needle ablation of the prostate? High-intensity focused ultrasound for thermal tissue ablation. Intraurethral stents--stents are endoscopically placed in the prostatic fossa and are designed to keep the prostatic urethra patent. They are usually covered by urothelium within 4-6 months after inseion. These devices are typically used for patients with limited life expectancy who are not deemed to be appropriate candidates for surgery or anesthesia.",

Patients with fluid on FAST examination, considered a positive FAST', who do not have immediate indications. for laparotomy and are hemodynamically stable undergo CT scanning to quantify their injuries. \" Sabiston v, rites - Hemodynamically stable patients sustaining blunt trauma are adequately evaluated by abdominal ultrasound or CT. unless other severe injuries take priority and the patient needs to go to the operating room before the objective abdominal evaluation. In such instances, DPL or. focussed abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) is usually performed in the operating room to rule out intra-abdominal bleeding requiring immediate surgical exploration. The main decision in an abdominal injury is to decide whether an exploratory laparotomy is necessary or not. Physical examination though may help sometimes, has significant limitations and may be unreliable. The diagnostic approach to penetrating (Gunshot and Stab wounds) and blunt abdominal trauma differs substantially. Gunshot abdominal wounds: Chances of internal injury is very high in gunshot wounds thus little preoperative evaluation is required and laparotomy is mandatory. Stab wounds to abdomen: In contrast to GSWs, SWs are less likely to injure intra-abdominal organs. Patients with isolated penetrating abdominal wound if hypotensive, or in shock or showing peritoneal signs go for exploratory laparotomy. Management of stable patients is debatable and controversial. Various methods are used to determine whether laparotomy is necessary or not. Anterior stab wound- In ant. stab wounds local wound exploration can be performed to determine if there is any penetration of the peritoneal cavity. If the tract terminates without entering the peritoneum, the injury can be managed as a deep laceration and laparotomy is not needed. Otherwise, penetration of the peritoneum is assumed, and significant injury must be excluded by fuher diagnostic evaluations. Options include diagnostic peritoneal lavage, laparoscopy, CT, FAST, and admission with observation. Flank and back wounds- There is more debate over the management of stab wounds to the flank and back. These injuries are special because of the risks associated with retroperitoneal organ injury-colon, kidneys and ureter. Triple contrast CT (i. e. oral, IV, and rectal contrast) is advised to detect colon and retroperitoneal injuries and the need for laparotomy. Other methods like DPL, laparoscopy arc also advised. Blunt abdominal injury: Hemodynamically stable patients sustaining blunt trauma are adequately evaluated by abdominal ultrasound or CT (CT in selected cases to refine the diagnosis) unless other severe injuries take priority and the patient needs to go to the operating room before the objective abdominal evaluation. In such instances, DPL or focussed abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) is usually performed in the operating room to rule out infra-abdominal bleeding requiring immediate exploratory laparotomy. US has largely replaced DPL. Management of hemodynamically unstable pt: a hemodynamically unstable pt is evaluated by FAST and if infra-abdominal fluid detected, undergoes laparotomy.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Fracture dislocation of C2 Hangman's fracture Hangman's fracture is bilateral fracture of the pars interaicularis of axis (C2) with traumatic spondylolisthesis of axis (C2) over C3 veebrae. Thus Hangman's fracture is not simply a fracture, but fracture dislocation of axis (C2). The mechanism of injury is extension with distraction (in true, judicial hangman's fracture) and hyper-extension, axial compression &. flexion (in civilian injuries, which are now more common). It is second most common type of Axis (C2) fracture, second only to odontoid fractures. Fatalaties are common, However, neurological deficit is unusual as the fracture of posterior arch decompress the spinal cord. Most of the fatalities occur at the scene of injury, acute post admission moality is low. Successful healing of C2 traumatic spondylolishesis is repoed to approach 95%. This is most commonly achieved with non-operative measures, even in the presence of displacement of pars inter-aicularis. Undisplaced fractures are treated in a semi-rigid ohosis, and displaced fracture are closed reduced & treated with halo-vest. Occasionally, the hangman's fracture is associated with a C2/3 facet dislocation. This is a severely unstable injury; open reduction and stabilization is required.",
