Type E is also known as H shaped Fistula Least Common- Type D Classification of TEF Type A: Atresia only (6%) Type B: Atresia with proximal TEF (2%) Type C: Atresia with distal TEF (85%): Most common Type D: Atresia with both proximal and distal TEF (rare) Type E: TEF only (1%) Clinical Features The diagnosis of EA is enteained in an infant with excessive salivation along with coughing or choking during the first oral feeding. A maternal history of polyhydramnios is often present. The newborn baby with atresia regurgitates all of its first and subsequent feeds0. Saliva pours continuously from its mouth. Repeated episodes of coughing, choking and cyanosis occur on feeding in TEF. Associated Anomalies MC anomaly associated with TEF is CVS (VSD). Esophageal atresia may occur as pa of VACTERL group of anomalies: -V: Veebral body segmentation defects0 -A: Anal atresia0 -C: Cardiovascular (PDA, VSD) -TE: Tracheoesophageal fistula -R: Renal (unilateral renal agenesis) -L: Limb anomalies (radial ray hyplasia)",
