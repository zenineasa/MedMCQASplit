        "exp": "Ans. (b) Normal saline. Ref.-. Harrison 18th ed. / 270. Normal saline is the preferred fluid for volume expansion in a crashing patient with un-recordable BP. The main point to be noted is that if ringer lactate is infused in these patients, then lactate in the solution will never reach the liver where it is normally converted into bicarbonate. Hence the accumulated lactate will get broken into lactic acid that will worsen the status of patient of poly-trauma who is already acidotic. Dextran would not be indicated as it exhibits anti-thrombotic tendency.",

Ref: Sabiston 19th ed. 529-30* IV fluid resuscitation is immediately required: In children with burn >10% TBS A and adult with burn >15% TBS A* Maximum fluid is given in first 8 hours (50%) rest of the fluid will be given in subsequent hours (25% + 25% in next 16 hours).* Most commonly used/preferred fluid: Ringer lactate (Crystalloids). Because it is a relatively isotonic crystalloid solution that is the key component of almost all resuscitative strategies, at least for the first 24-48 hours.* However, some centers use human albumin, FFP or hypertonic saline.* RL is preferable to isotonic sodium chloride solution (ie, normal saline ) for large-volume resuscitations because its lower sodium concentration (130 m. Eq/L vs 154 m. Eq/L) and higher pH concentration (6. 5 vs 5. 0) are closer to physiologic levels.* Hypotonic fluid is not given, as it can lead to hyponatremia and water intoxication.* Maintenance fluid in children: Dextrose -saline. Also Know* Hypertonic saline has been effective in treating burn shock as it produces hyperosmolarity and hypernatremia* This reduces the shift of intracellular water to the extracellular space",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e.. Metabolic acidosis Complications of Parenteral Nutrition. Mechanical complications. Mechanical complications may occur during central line placement. These include pneumothorax, brachial plexus injury, subclavian or carotid artery puncture, hemothorax, and chylothorax etc. Thrombosis or pulmonary embolism may occur secondary to central venous catheter use. Infectious complications. Sepsis occurs secondary to contamination of the central venous catheter. Metabolic complications. Metabolic complications can be divided into Early or nutrient related and Late or related to long term administration. Early complications include, among others, hyperglycemia, refeeding syndrome, and lipid metabolism abnormalities. Complications associated with long-term PN infusion include steatosis, cholestasis, and metabolic bone disease. Hyperglycemia-is the most common metabolic complication associated with PN administration. Hypoglycemia- Abrupt discontinuation of TPN can produce rebound hypoglycemia in patients with limited oral intake. Hyperlipidemia. Refeeding syndrome -Refeeding syndrome is defined as severe electrolyte and fluid shifts that may result from refeeding after severe weight loss (protein-calorie malnutrition). In starvation, energy is derived principally from fat metabolism. TPN results in a shift from fat to glucose as the predominant fuel, and rapid anabolism increases the production of phosphorylated intermediates of glycolysis. These intermediates trap phosphate, producing profound hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemia is the hallmark of the refeeding syndromeand has been reported in patients being repleted both parenterally and enteral ly. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia also occur. The lack of phosphate and potassium lead to a relative ATP deficiency, resulting in the insidious onset of respiratory failure and reduced cardiac stroke volume. The refeeding syndrome can be life threatening if not promptly treated. Because of these risks, the rate of. TPN administration in a severly malnourished patient should be slowly increased over several days. Hepatobiliary complications -Hepatic dysfunction is a common manifestation of long-term parenteral nutrition support. It includes elevated serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase. Steatosis, steatohepatitis, lipidosis, chloestasis, fibrosis and cirrhosis can occur. Although these abnormalities are usually benign and transient, more serious and progressive disease can develop in a small subset of patients, usually after 16 weeks of PN. Biliary complications include acalculous cholecystitis, gallbladder sludge, and cholelithiasis. Metabolic Bone disease - Including osteomalacia or osteopenia may be seen with long-term TPN.
