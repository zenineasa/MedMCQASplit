        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e.. Ileocecal tuberculosis Tuberculosis of the small intestine occurs in two forms. o Primary infection is usually due to bovine strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis and results from ingesting infected milk. In India the human strain may also cause such primary tuberculosis. This produces hyperplastic tuberculosis, o Secondary infection occurs due to swallowing of tubercle bacilli in a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis. This leads to ulcerative tuberculosis, the more common form of intestinal tuberculosis. Hyperplastic tuberculosiso Caused by ingestion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by pts with a high resistance to the organism. The infection established itself in lymphoid follicles and the resulting chronic inflammation causes thickening of the intestinal wall and narrowing of the lumen. There is early involvement of the regional lymph nodes which may caseate. o Untreated sooner or later subacute intestinal obstruction will supervene often together with the impaction of an enterolith in the narrowed lumen, o It usually occurs in the ileocecal region. o Clinical features. Attacks of acute abdominal pain with intermittent diarrhoea. Sometimes the presenting picture is of a mass in the rt iliac fossa in a pt with vague ill health. Features of blind loop syndrome may develop due to stasis, distention and chronic infection in the segment of ileum proximal to obstruction. o Barium meal radiography will reveal. Persistent narrowing of the affected segtnent ie the terminal ileum and the caecum. The caecum is pulled up and may become subhepatic, As the caecum is pulled up the ileo-caecal angle is widened. Normal ileo-caecal angle is 90\" In ileocaecal tuberculosis this angle may increase upto 150dego Treatment: This depends on the presence or absence of obstructive symptoms. ATT is given in both cases. If obstruction is present ileocaecal resection is best method of tft (along with ATT). Ulcerative tuberculosiso It is usually secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis and results from swallowing tubercle bacilli in the sputum (cf.

        "question": "Early postoperative complication of ileostomy",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e. Necrosis \"Stoma necrosis may occur in the early postoperative period and usually is caused by skeletonizing the distal small bowel and/or creating an overly tight fascial defect. Schwartz 9/e pl031. Stomal Complications. Category. Complication Early. Late. Stoma. Poor location. Prolapse Retraction. Stenosis Ischemic necrosis. Parastomal hernia Detachment. Fistula formation Abscess formation.

Bowel obstruction Nonclosure. May also develop as a late complication. Other complications are: Diarrhea. Urinary tract calculi. Gallstones. Important points about Ostomies. An intestinal stoma is an opening of the bowel onto the surface of the abdomen. Depending upon the clinical situation, a stoma may be temporary or permanent. It may be end-on or a loop. A temporary ileostomy often is used to \"protect\" an anastomosis that is at risk for leakage (low in the rectum, in an irradiated field, in an immunocompromised or malnourished patient, and in some emergency operations). In this setting, the stoma often is constructed as a loop ileostomy. A permanent ileostomy sometimes is required after total proctocolectomy or in patients with obstruction. An end ileostomy is the preferred configuration for a permanent ileostomy. Most colostomies are created as end colostomies rather than loop colostomies. The bulkiness of the colon makes a loop colostomy awkward for an appliance, and prolapse is more likely with this configuration. However, regardless of the indication for a stoma, placement and construction are crucial for function. A stoma should be located within the rectus muscle to minimize the risk of a postoperative parastomal hernia. It also should be placed where the patient can see it and easily manipulate the appliance. The surrounding abdominal soft tissue should be as flat as possible to ensure a tight seal and prevent leakage. The optimal position for an ileostomy is in the right lower quadrant. The most desirable position for a sigmoid or descending colostomy is usually in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. However, if the patient is obese, it may be preferable to site the colostomy in the left upper quadrant so that it is visible to the patient and not trapped on the undersurface of a panniculus. If a distal transverse colostomy is planned, the left upper quadrant is usually the preferable site. The left colon should be used for a colostomy if possible; the distal transverse colon is also a reasonable choice. Proximal colostomies should be avoided, as they will combine the worst features of both a colostomy and an ileostomy: liquid, high-volume, foul-smelling effluent. Parastomal hernia is the most common late complication of a colostomy. Parastomal hernia is less common after an ileostomy than after a colostomy. Most common indication: According to Maingot's Abdominal Operations, the most common indication for an ostomy is Ulcerative colitis, followed by Colorectal cancer. Most common indication for ileostomy is Inflammatory bowel disease (Ulcerative colitis). The most common indication for a colostomy is colorectal cancer.",

Resection of ileum results in a significant enhancement of gastric motility and acceleration of intestinal transit. Following ileal resection the colon receives a much larger volume of fluid and electrolytes and it also receives bile salts, which reduce its ability to absorb salt and water, resulting in diarrhoea. Even the loss of 100 cm of ileum causes steathorrea, which may necessitate the administration of oral cholestyramine to bind bile salts. With larger resections (> 100 cm) dietary fat restriction may be necessary. If the distal two thirds of the ileum, including the ileocecal valve, is resected, significant abnormalities of absorption of bile salts and vitamin Br may occur, resulting in diarrhea and anemia. Regular parenteral vitamin B12 is required.",
