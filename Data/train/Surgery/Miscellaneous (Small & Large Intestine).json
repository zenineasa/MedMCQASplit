Ileocecal tuberculosis Tuberculosis of the small intestine occurs in two forms. o Primary infection is usually due to bovine strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis and results from ingesting infected milk. In India the human strain may also cause such primary tuberculosis. This produces hyperplastic tuberculosis, o Secondary infection occurs due to swallowing of tubercle bacilli in a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis. This leads to ulcerative tuberculosis, the more common form of intestinal tuberculosis. Hyperplastic tuberculosiso Caused by ingestion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by pts with a high resistance to the organism. The infection established itself in lymphoid follicles and the resulting chronic inflammation causes thickening of the intestinal wall and narrowing of the lumen. There is early involvement of the regional lymph nodes which may caseate. o Untreated sooner or later subacute intestinal obstruction will supervene often together with the impaction of an enterolith in the narrowed lumen, o It usually occurs in the ileocecal region. o Clinical features. Attacks of acute abdominal pain with intermittent diarrhoea. Sometimes the presenting picture is of a mass in the rt iliac fossa in a pt with vague ill health.

        "question": "Early postoperative complication of ileostomy",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e.

Stomal Complications. Category. Complication Early. Late. Stoma. Poor location. Prolapse Retraction. Stenosis Ischemic necrosis. Parastomal hernia Detachment. Fistula formation Abscess formation.

Bowel obstruction Nonclosure. May also develop as a late complication. Other complications are: Diarrhea. Urinary tract calculi. Gallstones. Important points about Ostomies. An intestinal stoma is an opening of the bowel onto the surface of the abdomen. Depending upon the clinical situation, a stoma may be temporary or permanent. It may be end-on or a loop. A temporary ileostomy often is used to \"protect\" an anastomosis that is at risk for leakage (low in the rectum, in an irradiated field, in an immunocompromised or malnourished patient, and in some emergency operations). In this setting, the stoma often is constructed as a loop ileostomy. A permanent ileostomy sometimes is required after total proctocolectomy or in patients with obstruction. An end ileostomy is the preferred configuration for a permanent ileostomy. Most colostomies are created as end colostomies rather than loop colostomies. The bulkiness of the colon makes a loop colostomy awkward for an appliance, and prolapse is more likely with this configuration. However, regardless of the indication for a stoma, placement and construction are crucial for function. A stoma should be located within the rectus muscle to minimize the risk of a postoperative parastomal hernia. It also should be placed where the patient can see it and easily manipulate the appliance. The surrounding abdominal soft tissue should be as flat as possible to ensure a tight seal and prevent leakage. The optimal position for an ileostomy is in the right lower quadrant. The most desirable position for a sigmoid or descending colostomy is usually in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. However, if the patient is obese, it may be preferable to site the colostomy in the left upper quadrant so that it is visible to the patient and not trapped on the undersurface of a panniculus. If a distal transverse colostomy is planned, the left upper quadrant is usually the preferable site. The left colon should be used for a colostomy if possible; the distal transverse colon is also a reasonable choice. Proximal colostomies should be avoided, as they will combine the worst features of both a colostomy and an ileostomy: liquid, high-volume, foul-smelling effluent. Parastomal hernia is the most common late complication of a colostomy. Parastomal hernia is less common after an ileostomy than after a colostomy. Most common indication: According to Maingot's Abdominal Operations, the most common indication for an ostomy is Ulcerative colitis, followed by Colorectal cancer. Most common indication for ileostomy is Inflammatory bowel disease (Ulcerative colitis). The most common indication for a colostomy is colorectal cancer.",

Resection of ileum results in a significant enhancement of gastric motility and acceleration of intestinal transit. Following ileal resection the colon receives a much larger volume of fluid and electrolytes and it also receives bile salts, which reduce its ability to absorb salt and water, resulting in diarrhoea. Even the loss of 100 cm of ileum causes steathorrea, which may necessitate the administration of oral cholestyramine to bind bile salts. With larger resections (> 100 cm) dietary fat restriction may be necessary. If the distal two thirds of the ileum, including the ileocecal valve, is resected, significant abnormalities of absorption of bile salts and vitamin Br may occur, resulting in diarrhea and anemia.

        "exp": "Ref: l. Campbell-Walsh Urology, 9th Edition, Chapter 72, Urinary tract fistula. 2. Glenn's Urological Surgery, Sixth Edition, Chapter 26 Enterovesical and Reciourethral Fishdae3. Sahiston Textbook of Surgery, 19th Edition, Pg: 1313. Explanation:\"The most common presenting symptom of colovesical fistula is pneumaturia\"About other options. Barium enema is diagnostic - barium enema will fail to reveal a fistula 50% of the time. Common in females - more common in men than in women because the uterus prevents the sigmoid from adhering to the bladder. May be a surgical complication - Colovesical fistulas can occur as a result of surgical complication, however it is rare. Iatrogenic Rectovesical fistula is more common. Hence, option A. commonly presents withpneumaturia appears more appropriate. Vesicoenteric fistulas. It commonly occurs in the setting of bowel disease, such as diverticulitis. colorectal carcinoma, and Crohn's disease. Less common causes include irradiation, infection, and trauma (external penetrating trauma as well as iatrogenic surgical trauma). Diverticulitis is the most common cause of colovesical fistula, accounting for approximately 70% of cases. Sigmoid-vesicular fistulas are more common in men than in women because the uterus prevents the sigmoid from adhering to the bladder. Women with sigmoid fistulas have usually had a prior hysterectomy. Clinical features. Although enterovesical fistulae are almost always secondary to extravesical pathology, they present with urinary symptoms. The MC presenting symptom is pneumaturia, (seen in 50% to 85% cases). Irritative voiding symptoms (in 70% to 90% cases). Fecaluria (20% to 68%) of patients with enterovesical fistulae and tends to be more common with diverticular and malignant fistulae. The classic presentation of vesicoenteric fistula is described as Gouverneur's syndrome and consists of suprapubic pain, urinary frequency, dysuria, and tenesmus. Other symptoms include hematuria, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary retention, perineal pain, hematochezia, and fever. Urine in the stool is rarely reported with enterovesical fistulae: these fistulae tend to be unidirectional with flow from the high-pressure intestinal tract to the low-pressure urinary tract. Investigations. The most reliable test Computed Tomography (CT Scan), which may demonstrate air in the bladder '. The triad of findings on CT that are suggestive of colovesical fistula. Bladder wall thickening adjacent to a loop of thickened colon. Air in the bladder (in the absence of previous lower urinary tract manipulation). Presence of colonic diverticula. A barium enema will fail to reveal a fistula 50% of the time, and an IV pyelogram is even less accurate. Cystoscopy usually reveals cystitis and bullous edema at the site of the fistula, but the test is helpful to exclude cancer (colon or bladder) as the cause of the fistula. Management. Nonoperative management. In nontoxic, minimally symptomatic patients with nonmalignam causes of enterovesical fistulas, a trial of medical therapy including intravenous total parenteral nutrition bowel rest, and antibiotics may be warranted. This may be the preferred initial approach, especially in patients with Crohn's disease, in whom the notion of immediate exploratory laparotomy and bowel resection is discouraged because of the chronic relapsing nature of the disease. Operative Management. The goal of operative management is to separate and close the involved organs with minimal anatomic disruption and normal long-term function of both systems. Both one- and tw o-stage procedures have been advocated, depending on the clinical circumstances. A one-stage procedure involves removal of the fistula, closure of the involved organs, and primary reanastomosis of the bowel after resection of the involved bowel segment. A two-stage approach advocates removal of the fistula, closure of the involved organs, and construction of a temporary proximal diverting colostomy, with a later return to the operating room for colostomy takedown once the fistula track is demonstrated to be closed. The choice of whether to proceed with a one- stage or two-stage repair is influenced by the location and cause of the fistula, the patient's general condition, the presence of a pelvic abscess, and the presence of colonic obstruction. Patients with an inflammatory cause of the fistula hut without gross contamination can be treated with a one-stage procedure, whereas those with unprepared bowel, gross contamination, or abscess may require a two-stage procedure.",

Barium meal radiography will reveal# Persistent narrowing of the affected segment i. e. the terminal ileum and the caecum.# The caecum is pulled up * and may become subhepatic.# As the caecum is pulled up the ileo-caecal angle is widened. Normal ileo-caecal angle is 900. In ileocaecal tuberculosis this angle may increase upto 1500.*Treatment: This depends on the presence or absence of obstructive symptoms.# ATT is given in both cases.# If obstruction is present ileocaecal resection is best method of t/t (along with ATT)B) Ulcerative tuberculosiso It is usually secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis and results from swallowing tubercle bacilli in the sputum (cf. Hyperplastic tuberculosis is usually primary there is no pulmonary tuberculosis)o Usually longer parts of the terminal ileum is involved. o There are multiple ulcers in the terminal ileum lying transversely o Pt presents with diarrhoea and wt losso Barium meal shows absence of filling of the lower ileum, caecum and most of the ascending colon as a result of narrowing and hypermotility of the ulcerated segment. Treatment# A course of A TT is adequate# Operation is rarely required, in rare events of perforation or intestinal obstruction.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Hirsutism Short bowel syndrome -o Presence of less than 200 cm of residual small bowrel in adult patients. o Insufficient absorptive capacity of small intestine results in diarrhea, dehydration and malnutition. Causes - Small intestine resection (massive) due to. Massive resection in single. Cumutative effect of multipleoperation as in acute mesentericoperations of small intestineischemia, malignancyresected as in Crohn's diseaseo In pediatric patients, MC etiologies are intestinal atresia, volvulus and necrotizing enterocolitis. Resection of less than 50% of small intestine is generally well tolerated. o Clinically significant malabsorption occurs when more than 50 to 80% of small intestine has been resected. o Resection ofjejunum is better tolerated than resection of ileum. o Presence of healthy colon, intact ileocecal valve and healthy residual small bowel are factors associated with decreased severity of malabsorption. o Malabsorption in short bowel syndrome is exacerbated by a characteristic hypergastrinemia associated gastric acid hypersecretion which persists for 1 to 2 years post operatively. Management -1. Medical- a)TPNHigh dose H-, reseptor antagonist/PPLAntimotility agents - Loperamide. Octreotide - reduces volume of GI secretions. o Levels of Iron, Magnesium, Zinc, Copper and vitamins must be monitored closely and deficienc ies prevented. 1 Surgery -Non transplant surgery: Goal is to increase nutrient and fluid absorption by slowing intestinal transit or increasing intestinal length. Segmental reversal of small bowel. Colon interposition. Small intestinal valves construction. Electrical pacing of small intestine. Bianchi's Intestinal lengthening operation (generally used in pediatric patients with dilated small bowel). Serial transverse enteroplasty (2003). Intestinal transplantation: Indicated for life threatening complications of intestinal failure or chronic TPN therapy -Impending/overt liver failure. Thrombosis of major central veins. Frequent cathater related sepsis. Frequent episodes of severe dehydration.",
