        "exp": "Ans. c (Commonly associated with anterior urethral rupture). (Ref. LB, 25th/ 1365). Rupture of the bladder may be -# Intraperitoneal (20 per cent) or - Extraperitoneal (80 per cent). Extraperitoneal bladder rupture (JIPMER 2003)# It is commonest type of bladder rupture (80%) after blunt trauma abdomen & is associated usually with bony pelvis & posterior urethral injuries.# The urine extravasates in perivesical region, first in cave of Ritzius i. e., retropubic space.# Radiograph may show pelvic bones, pear shaped bladder density, loss of obturation fat planes, upward displacement of coils & paralytic ileus.# Cystography (gold standard, definitive) reveals distorted bladder with extravasation of contrast in perivesical space & streaks of contrast into facial planes giving typical \"sun burst\" appearance.# US shows \"bladder in bladder\" appearance due to perivesical collection and rent may be detected.# CT cystography is best investigative technique as the exact site & extent of rent, bladder wall contusions, blood clots & surrounding organ injuries can be detected.# Can be managed conservatively without surgical intervention. Intraperitoneal rupture# Intraperitoneal rupture may be secondary to a blow, kick or fall on a fully distended bladder and it is more common in the male than in the female, and usually follows a bout of beer drinking. More rarely, it is due to surgical damage. Extraperitoneal rupture is usually caused by a fractured pelvis or is secondary to major trauma or surgical damage.# Treatment of intraperitoneal rupture. The mainstay is to provide adequate drainage of the bladder. The standard treatment is to perform a lower midline laparotomy, urine is removed by suction, after which the patient is placed in Trendelenberg's position. The edges of the rent, which are usually situated in the posterior part of the dome of the bladder, are trimmed and sutured with two layers of interrupted catgut stitches, and the operation completed by placement of a suprapubic and urethral catheter. The peritoneum should be irrigated with copious amounts of warm saline. Operations in which the bladder is liable to be injured are:# Inguinal or femoral herniotomy;# Hysterectomy by either the abdominal or vaginal route; and# Excision of the rectum. In the latter two operations, the bladder should be catheterised prior to operation to minimize the risks of this accident. If the injury is recognised at the time, the bladder must be repaired in two layers and urethral catheter drainage maintained for 7 days. If it is not recognised, the treatment is similar to that of rupture of the bladder. When accidental perforation of the bladder occurs during endoscopic resection of a bladder tumour, or the prostatic capsule is perforated during transurethral prostatectomy, the perforation is usually extraperitoneal.",

Surgical treatments for uterovaginal prolapse. Condition. Treatment. Urethrocele/ cystocele. Traditionally; an anterior vaginal wall repair (anterior colporrhaphy) was performed vaginally; now replaced by vaginally inserted tape (transvaginal tape (TVT) or transobturator tape (TOT)] or mesh slings. Uterine prolapse. If family complete, a vaginal hysterotomy with an anterior vaginal wall repair if necessary. If the uterus is to be preserved use either amputation of the cervix with suturing of the transverse cervical ligaments vaginally (Manchester repair) or laparoscopic plication of the uterosacral ligaments (Mc. Call sulture). Enterocele. Similar technique to repair of a hernia. The vaginal skin is opened and the hernial sac repaired. Vault prolapse. Sacrospinous fixation or sacrocolpopexy; the vault is attached to the sacrum using a non-absorbable suture. Rectocele. Posterior coiporrhaphy; the posterior vaginal wall is opened, the rectum returned to its normal position and redundant vaginal skin is excised. A laparoscopic approach to repairing the defect in the pelvic floor with or without the use of a mesh is now more popular and as there is no resulting scarring in the vaginal skin the incidence of post-surgery dyspareunia is less",
