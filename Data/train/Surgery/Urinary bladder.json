Adenocarcinoma (usually arise in the fundus of the bladder at the site of urachal remnant). Risk Factors. Transitional ceil cancer. Squamous cell cancer*. Smoking*.

Schistosomiasis (Bilharziasis)*. Chronic bladder infection*. Irradiation*. Bladder diverticula. Carcinoma in situ or Flat urothelial carcinoma - Pagetoid spread Staging and Treatment. Superficial bladder cancers (does not invade the detrusor muscle)p. Ta - no lamina propria invasionp. T1 - lamina propria invasion. The most common site of superficial tumors are the trigone and the lateral walls of bladder Clinical Features. Painless gross hematuria is the most common symptom. Frequency, urgency and dysuria are common symptoms. Metastasis: Most common primary to metastasize to penis - bladder cancer. Investigations. New tests: Detection of antigens such as nuclear matrix proteins (NMP22) or mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) in urine, which may be able to detect new or recurrent tumors. The most common radiological sign is a filling defect. For staging contrast-CTMRI can demonstrate LN metastases and muscle invasion. Cystourethroscopy is the mainstay of diagnosis. Treatment. Superficial bladder cancers. Solitary papillary lesions, no CIS: Endoscopic transurethral resection (TURT)CIS, recurrent disease, T1 disease, >40% bladder surface involvement: TURT followed by intravesical therapy. Standard intravesical therapy: Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) 6 weeks instillations; followed by monthly instillations for 1 year. Other agents: Mitomycin C, interferon, gemcitabine. For persistent disease after BCG, immediate cystectomy. Muscle invasion cancers (p. T2-p.
