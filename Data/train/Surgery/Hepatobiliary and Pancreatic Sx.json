Postsinusoidal hypertension can also be divided into: intrahepatic - vascular occlusive disease posthepatic:- I. Budd-Chiari II. congestive heart failure III.

Doppler ultrasound allows identification of vascular occlusion and the direction of poal venous low. CT and MR angiography are useful for evaluating poal venous patency and anatomy. The most accurate method for measuring poal hypertension is hepatic venography. This procedure introduces a balloon catheter directly into the hepatic vein where free hepatic venous pressure (FHVP) is measured. The hepatic vein is then occluded by inflation of the balloon allowing measurement of the wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHVP). The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) may then be calculated by subtracting the FHVP rom the WHVP (HVPG = WHVP-FHVP). Clinically significant poal hypertension is defined as HVPG greater than 10 mm Hg.
