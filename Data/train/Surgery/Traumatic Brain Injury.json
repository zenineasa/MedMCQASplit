        "exp": "Ans: C (Seizures) Ref:. J. Claude Hemphill. Multimodal Monitoring and Neurocritical Care Bioinformatics: Secondary Brain Injury. Med scape education. Explanation: When patients have an acute neurological catastrophe such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) or stroke, damage to the brain can occur at the time of the initial event. This damage is termed primary brain injury, and the underlying mechanisms include: Intraparenchymal or extra-axial traumatic or spontaneous hemorrhage. Diffuse axonal injury (in TBI). Focal or global ischemia from acute ischemic stroke or global cerebral ischemia during cardiac arrest. Although interventions (eg: surgical hematoma evacuation ) can be undertaken to limit or reverse primary brain injury, much of the primary damage may be irreversible. This primary brain injury initiates a cascade of biochemical events that are rexersible. This process is termed secondary brain injury. Secondary brain injury can generally be considered as two related concepts: Cellular injury cascades. Secondary brain insults (SBIs). An example of the cellular injury cascade is the ischemic cascade in which events such as excitotoxicity, intracellular calcium influx, and free radical membrane damage are ongoing. Hence, ultra-early ischemic stroke treatment via revascularization of an occluded intracranial artery with thrombolytic agents is intended to restore perfusion before permanent cell death, thereby reversing this secondary brain injury. In addition to initiating ischemic and apoptotic cell injury cascades, primary brain injuries make injured, but salvageable, brain tissue vulnerable to SB Is. Hypotension, hypoxia and hypoglycemia are all examples of SBIs in which decreased substrate delivery to an injured brain further worsens injury. On the other hand, fever, seizures and hyperglycemia are examples of SBIs in which increased metabolic demand may outstrip compensator) mechanisms and result in further injury. Examples of primary and secondary brain injury in TBIPrimary.

Haemodilution APPENDIX- 81. TRAUMATIC INTRACRANIAL HEMATOMAS: Extradural hemorrhage. Subdural hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage. CAUSELower-energy trauma with less resultant primary brain injury causing rupture of middle meningeal artery, usually traumatic coup injury (rapid because it is usually from arteries) 10% of epidural bleeds may be venous, 70-80% of epidural hematomas (EDHs) are located in the temporoparietal region. High energy impacts with rupture of bridging veins (superior cerebral vein) slower onset than those of epidural hemorrhages because the lower pressure veins bleed more slowly than arteries, most often around the tops and sides of the frontal and parietal lobes, A subdural hematoma (SDH) is the most common type of intracranial mass lesion. Head trauma > Rupture of berry s aneurysm. Intracerebral hematomas and subarachnoid hemorrhages can also result from strokes. PEAK AGEYounger than 20 years. Bimodal age 60 and older, 50 years. HISTORYFollowing injury, the patient may or may not lose consciousness. Subdural hematomas are divided into acute, subacute, and chronic, depending on the speed of their onset. Risk factors: 1. Shaken baby syndrome2. Blood thinners(anticoagulants)3. Long-term alcohol abuse4. Dementia5. Elderly6. Alcoholics. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) range from subtle prodromal events to the classic presentation. Prodromal events often are misdiagnosed, while the classic presentation is one of the most pathognomonic pictures in all of clinical medicine. SIGNS & SYMPTOMS* Hypertension* Bradycardia* Bradypnea* Severe headache* Vomiting* Siizures. EDH has a classic three-stage clinical presentation that is probably seen in only 20% of cases. The patient is initially unconscious from the concussive aspect of the head trauma. The patient then awakens and has a lucid interval while the hematoma subclinically expands. As the volume of the hematoma grows, the decompensated region of the pressure-volume curve is reached, ICP increases, and the patient becomes lethargic and herniates. Uncal herniation from an EDH classically causes ipsilateral third nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis.* Loss of consciousness* Instability* Seizures* Disorientation* Ataxia* Altered breathing pattern* Blurred vision* Persistent headache, * Fluctuating drowsiness, * Confusion* Memory changes* Paralysis on the side of the body opposite the hematoma* Speech or language impairment* Severe headache with a rapid onset (\"thunderclap headache\")* Confusion or a lowered level of consciousness* Seizures* Photophobia* Focal neurologic deficit (hemiparesis, aphasia, hemineglect, cranial nerve palsies memory loss)* Motor neurologic deficits* Subhyaloid retinal hemorrhage & papilledema*| Temperature (secondary to chemical meningitis)*| Blood pressure* Neck stiffness usually presents six hours after initial onsetof SAH, * Isolated dilation of a pupil and loss of the pupillary light reflex may reflect brain herniation as a result of rising intracranial pressure * Oculomotornerve abnormalities (affected eye looking downward and outward and inability to lift the eyelid on the same side) or palsy, * \"sympathetic surge\" i. e. overactivation of the sympathetic system.

Coma, decerebrate or decorticate posturing CT SCANOn head CT the dot is bright, biconvex (lentiform), and has a well-defined border that usually respects cranial suture lines. On head CT scan, the clot is bright or mixed-density, crescent-shaped (lunate) with a concave surface away from the skull, may have a less distinct border, and does not cross the midline due to the presence of the falxsensitivity of 98% within the first 12 hours 8t 93% within 24 hours. In general, blood localized to the basal cisterns, the sylvian fissure, or the intra-hemispheric fissure indicates rupture of a saccular aneurysm. Anterior communicating artery aneurysms often are associated with interhemispheric and intraventricular hemorrhages. Middle communicating artery and posterior communicating artery aneurysms are associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhages. Epidural hematoma (EDH) forms an extraaxial, smoothly marginated, lenticular, or biconvex homogenous density. While MRI is superior for demonstrating the size of an acute subdural hematoma (SDH) and its effect on the brain, noncontrast head CT is the primary means of making a diagnosis and suffice for immediate management purposes. TREATMENTPatients who meet all of the following criteria may be managed conservatively: clot volume <30 cm3, maximum thickness < 1. 5 cm, and GCS score >8. Open craniotomy for evacuation of the concealed clot and hemostasis is indicated for EDH which are not managed conservatively. Open craniotomy for evacuation of acute SDH is indicated for any of the following: thickness > 1 cm, midline shift >5 mm, or GCS drop by two or more points from the time of injury to hospitalization. Nonoperatively managed hematomas may stabilize and eventually reabsorb, or evolve into chronic SDHs. Prompt neurosurgery or radiologically guided interventions with medications and other treatments to help prevent recurrence of the bleeding and complications. Many aneurysms are treated by a less invasive procedure called \"coiling\", which is carried out by instrumentation through large blood vessels. MORTALITY15 and20%30% overall, 60 to 80% in acute SDHUp to half of all cases of S AH are fatal and 10-15% of casualties die before reaching a hospital.
