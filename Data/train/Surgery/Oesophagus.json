Causes include weakened esophageal muscles & issues with lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. Heller Myotomy, surgical procedure offers long term symptomatic relief to these patients. It involves weakening of muscles at gastroesophageal junction, allowing the valve between oesophagus & stomach to remain open. [?]. Achalasia Treatment: 2 main methods. Heller's Myotomy: Surgical therapy now involves usually performing only an anterior myotomy, via either abdominal or thoracic approach. In addition to laparosocopic myotomy, thoracoscopic myotomy has also been described. Thoracic approach does have certain drawbacks. Heller's Cardiomyotomy - surgical 7-10 cm long incision made through lower oesophageal end & carried over to stomach, muscles are cut till mucosa bulges out. Myotomy should be extended up to aortic arch & distally up to stomach to 1-2 cm below the junction. Forceful dilatation - using Pneumatic Balloon under fluoroscopic control within LOS (300 mm. Hg pressure applied for 15 sec). Injection Treatment - Injection Botulinum toxin is injected in LES endoscopically, blocks ACh release. Drugs - Sublingual nifedipine gives short term relief. Endoscopic Myotomy. Laparoscopic Heller's Myotomy (LHM): Myotomy from 1. 5-3 cm distal to the ECJ dividing the longitudinal & oblique muscle to 6-8cm proximal to the ECJ dividing longitudinal & circular muscle of esophagus. Partial fundoplication is routinely performed as incidence of reflux after Heller's myotomy is >50%. It is due to loss of the ganglion cells in the myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus & cause is unknown. Chaga's disease (due to Trypanosoma cruzi) has marked similarities to achalasia. Other Options[?]. Hiatus Hernia: True paraoesophageal hernias with cardia remains in its anatomical position are rare. Vast majority of rolling hernias are mixed hernias in which the cardia is displaced into the chest & greater curve of the stomach rolls into the mediastinum. Elective surgery includes reduction of the hernia, excision of the sac, reducing the crural defect & retention of the stomach in the abdomen. [?]. Gastro Oesophageal Reflux Disease: Classical triad of symptoms is retrosternal burning pain (heartburn), epigastric pain (sometimes radiating through to the back) and regurgitation. GORD treated by medical management by proton pump inhibitor therapy +H2 receptor antagonists. Surgery includes; 1. Allison repair of hiatus hernia; 2. Nissen fundoplication; 3. Hill procedure; 4. Belsey mark IV operation. [?]. Duodenal stenosis: Duodenal atresia is the congenital septum of duodenal obstruction at the commencement of the third part of the duodenum. Repaired by duodenoduodenostomy.",

Bailey & Love, Surgery, 25th/pg. 1036)ACHALASIA CARDIA# Achalasia is a motor disorder of the esophageal smooth muscle in which the LES does not relax normally with swallowing, and the esophageal body undergoes nonperistaltic contractions. It is due to loss of the ganglion cells in the myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus, # C/f: Dysphagia appears early, occurs with both liquids and solids, and is worsened by emotional stress and hurried eating.# Two types:- Primary: is idiopathic- Secondary: Chagas' disease; Trypanosoma cruzi, Gastric carcinoma that infiltrates the esophagus (pseudoachalasia), Lymphoma, Certain viral infections, Eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and certain neurodegenerative disorders.# Ba swallow (initial test of choice):- Megaesophagus/sigmoid esophagus.- \"Bird beak\" deformity on barium swallow study is characteristic.- Absence of primary peristalsis below level of cricopharyngeus.- Hurst phenomenon (temporary transit through cardia when hydrostatic pressure of Ba column is above toxic LES pressure).# CCK which normally causes fall in sphincter pressure, paradoxically causes contraction of LES (CCK test) (Cholecys- tokinin).# MANOMETRY is best investigation for diagnosis. 0# Vigorous achalasia is numerous tertiary contractions in non-dilated distal esophagus of early achalasia.# Rx: Treatment is by either endoscopic dilatation or surgical myotomy (Heller's myotomy). Pneumatic dilatation with a 30-mm balloon, the incidence of perforation should be less than 0. 5%. The risk of perforation increases with bigger balloons, and they should be used cautiously for progressive dilatation over a period of weeks. Forceful dilatation is curative in 75-85% of cases. The results are best in patients aged more than 45 years. Myotomy is successful in more than 90% of cases and may be used after failed dilatation. Botulinum toxin by endoscopic injection into the LOS may be tried.",

The contribution of each component to operative success is widely debated, but it is clear that operations that fail to address all three components have inferior success rates.* Total Nissen's fundoplication used for the surgical management of GERD, tends to be associated with slightly more short-term dysphagia but is the most durable repair in terms of long-term reflux control.* Partial fundoplication, whether performed posteriorly (Toupet) or anteriorly (Dor, Watson), has fewer short- term side-effects at the expense of a slightly higher long-term failure rate.* One disadvantage of total fundoplication is the creation of an overcompetent cardia, resulting in the 'gas bloat' syndrome in which belching is impossible.",

LB 25th ed., 1024)PARAOESOPHAGEAL ('ROLLING') HIATUS HERNIA# Rolling hiatus hernias are dangerous# Unlike sliding hiatus hernia a rolling hiatus hernia is a true hernia that is prone to complications. True paraoesophageal hernias in which the cardia remains in its normal anatomical position are very rare and confined to museum exhibits and personal collections of interesting cases. The hernia is commonest in the elderly, but may occur in young fit people.# The symptoms of rolling hernia are mostly due to twisting and distortion of the oesophagus and stomach. Dysphagia is common. Chest pain may occur due to distension of an obstructed stomach. Classically the pain is relieved by a loud belch. Symptoms of GORD are variable.# The hernia may be visible on a plain X-ray of the chest as a gas bubble, often with a fluid level behind the heart. Fluid levels are not seen in sliding hernias. A barium meal is the best method of diagnosis. Endoscopic look may be confusing, especially in large hernias endoscopist feels as if have lost sense of direction.# Rolling hernias always require surgical repair as they are potentially dangerous. However, major surgery may not be an attractive prospect in frail elderly patients or in someone who has few symptoms. The essential part of the operation is reduction of the hernia and some form of gastropexy. Some surgeons perform a fundoplication arguing that this is a very effective means of maintaining reduction and that it deals with the associated GORD.# Laparosopic repair has recently become popular. Full anatomical repair of a large rolling hernia can be tedious and difficult by the laparoscopic approach and it is more common simply to reduce the hernia and perform a gastropexy. Some surgeons lay a sheet of prosthetic mesh across the hiatal opening to stop the bowel entering it.# Total or partial fundoplication? The disadvantage of the Nissen fundoplication is that it can produce an overcompetent cardia resulting in dysphagia or the gas bloat syndrome in which belching is prevented. As a result the stomach fills with air and the patient feels very full after meals and passes excessive flatus. The problem of the overcompetent cardia has been largely overcome by the floppy Nissen in which the fundoplication is made very loose around oesophagus and also by making a short fundoplication of 1 cm or so.",

Cervical esophagial perforation. Pleura breached. Perforation by flexible endoscope. Perforation of abdominal esophagus. Boerhaave's syndrome: This occurs classically when a person vomits against a closed glottis. The pressure in the esophagus increases rapidly, and the esophagus bursts at its weakest point in the lower third, sending a stream of material into the mediastinum and often the pleural cavity as well. The condition was first reported by Boerhaave. A large volume of material is released into the mediastinum, which causes rapid chemical irritation in the mediastinum and pleura followed by infection if untreated.",
