An intussusception is composed of three parts: the entering or inner tube; the returning or middle tube; and the sheath or outer tube (intussuscipiens).# most common in children, where it occurs in an idiopathic form with a peak incidence at 3-9 months.# Seventy to 95% of cases are classed as idiopathic. It is believed that hyperplasia of Peyer's patches in the terminal ileum may be the initiating event. This is due to weaning/viral infection.# Ileocolic type is otherwise most common and the colocolic variety is common in adults.# C/F: Intermittent sudden spasmodic abdominal pain, the 'red currant' jelly stool, palpable lump, feeling of emptiness in the right iliac fossa (the sign of Dance) and Empty RIF sign.# Ultrasonography is preferred over Barium enema today.# Ultrasound shows the mass with pseudokidney apperance or a target lesion or a bowel mass-like'doughnut sign.# A barium enema may diagnose by demonstrating signs like the claw sign and the coiled spring appearance.# Hydrostatic reduction is contraindicated in the presence of obstruction, peritonism or a prolonged history (greater than 48 hours) and is unlikely to succeed where a lead point is likely. It is successful in 50% of cases with a recurrence rate 5%.# Surgery is required where hydrostatic reduction has failed or is contraindicated. Reduction is achieved by squeezing the most distal part of the mass in a cephalad direction. Do not pull. In difficult cases the little finger may he gently inserted into the neck of the intussusception to try and separate adhesions (Cope's method).# In the presence of an irreducible or gangrenous intussusception the mass should be excised in situ and an anastomosis or temporary end stoma created.",

TREATMENTTreatment of choice - A pull through procedure in which normally innervated colon is anastamosed to the distal rectum just above the internal sphincter thus bypassing contractile non peristaltic segment and restoring normal defecation.

Congenital diverticula: (the prototype of which is Meckel's diverticula) are not so common. They contain all the layers of the intestine are thus termed 'true' diverticula. Acquired diverticula: are the most common type. They are mainly 'false'diverticula as they do not contain all the layers of the intestinal wall. o They are mainly found in the colon (mainly the left side of colon) with sigmoid colon being the most common site. The next most common area involved is the descending colon. The diverticula are uncommon in the small intestine. Note: that in Asian countries, the main distribution of diverticula (up to 70%) is right-sided and may have a more genetic influence. o So unless otherwise specified a diverticulosis refers to the multiple false diverticula of the colon. Pathogenesis of acquired diverticula. Acquired diverticula are herniation or sac-like projection of the mucosa through the muscularis propria. The protrusion occurs commonly at the point where the nutrient artery penetrates through the muscularis propria, resulting in a break in the integrity of the colonic wall. Another factor necessary for the genesis of diverticula is increased intraluminal pressure. It has been postulated that diets low in fibre reduce the stoooi bulk which in turn leads to increased peristaltic activity, particularly in the sigmoid colon. This increases the intraluminal pressure. o Diverticulosis is common in the Western world. It's rare in the underdeveloped and developing countries, where diets include more fibre and roughage. Diverticulosis/Diverticulitis. Diverticulitis meaning inflammation of the diverticula, is a complication of diverticulosis. Whereas diverticulosis is seen in nearly one-half of the individuals over the age of 60 yrs in western world, diverticulitis occurs in only about 20% of individuals with diverticulosis. Diagnosis. The diverticulosis could be demonstrated on barium enema. Characteristic 'saw-tooth ' appearance can be seen. But barium enema or colonoscopy should not be performed in acute settings because of high role of colonic perforation. y The diagnosis of diverticulitis is best made on CT scan. Treatment. Treatment is mainly medical (antibiotics, analgesia and bowel rest). Surgery is done for: o Who do not improve on medical therapyo Recurrent diverticulitiso In all patients with complicated diverticulitis (i. e. diverticulitis with abscess, obstruction, diffuse peritonitis, or fistulas). Surgery done in elective setting is: o A sigmoid colectomy wiih a primary anastomosis.",

Explanation: Erect abdominal X-ray is the first test ordered for suspected pneumoperitoneum. However CT abdomen is the most sensitive test for demonstrating pneumoperitoneum. Upright chest radiographs can detect as little as 1 ml of air. Lateral decubitus abdominal radiographs can also detect pneumoperitoneum effectively in patients who cannot stand: as little as 5 to 10 mL of gas may be detected with this technique. Approximately 75% of these patients will have a large enough pneumoperitoneum to be visible on X-rays. Where the plain radiographs are equivocal, then CT is the most sensitive imaging technique for diagnosis of free intraperitoneal air. Signs of free intraperitoneal air on a supine abdominal radiograph are. Air overlying or outlining solid organs such as liver and spleen (Lucent liver sign)A triangle of air outlining Morrison's pouch (Doges cap sign). Air outlining intraabdominal structures such as falciform ligament, umbilical median, medial and lateral ligaments (Inverted V sign). Bowel wall outlined by air both inside and outside (Rigler's sign). Centrally placed intraperitoneal free air (football sign). Scrotal air in children. Cupola sign of air under the central diaphragm. Conditions mimicking pneumoperitoneum. It is very important to be able to recognize conditions that can simulate pneumoperitoneum because an observational error may lead to unnecessary surgery. Chilaiditi's syndrome in which the colon is interposed between the liver and the diaphragm can mimic pneumoperitoneum, but usually haustral folds can be seen that will allow- identification of the colon. A gas-containing subphrenic abscess. Basal pulmonary atelectasis. On the left side, a gas-distended fundus of the stomach may cause confusion, and clarification by a decubitus film may be necessary. Postoperative air may sometimes cause confusion, but this should have resolved by 5 to 7 days and should decrease in size with time.",

Carcinoma of the left side of the colon- Most tumours occur in this location. They are usually of the stenosing variety. Left-sided tumours: rectal bleeding, alteration in bowel habit, tenesmus, obstruction.- The main symptoms are those of increasing intestinal obstruction.- Alteration of bowel habit. An adult previously having a predictably regula bowel habit suddenly develops irregularity.- The episodes of constipation may be followed by attacks of diarrhoea.- Distension. Lower abdominal distension is not uncommon and, as with the pain, is relieved by passing flatus. Carcinoma of the sigmoid- This follows the general pattern of the above, with these differences:- Pain is usually colicky from the outset.- Tenesmus. Low tumours may give rise to a feeling of the need for evacuation, which may result in tenesmus accompanied by the passage of mucus and blood, especially in the early morning.- Bladder symptoms are not unusual and in some instances may herald a colovesical fistula. Right-sided tumours- iron deficiency anemia, abdominal mass are presenting features. Carcinoma of the transverse colon- This may be mistaken for a carcinoma of the stomach because of the position of the tumour together with anemia and lassitude. Carcinoma of the caecum and ascending colon* Anemia, severe and unyielding to treatment; there may be a palpable tumour present.* The presence of a mass in the right iliac fossa. Colonoscopy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.* Caecal carcinoma is sometimes discovered unexpectedly at operation for acute appendicitis or for an appendix abscess failing to resolve.

Vs diverticulum contains heterotopic epithelium of gastric, colonic or pancreatic type. A Meckel's diverticulum can present clinically in the following ways: i) Haemorrhage: If gastric mucosa is present, peptic ulceration can occur and present as painless maroon rectal bleeding or melaena. If the stomach, duodenum and colon are cleared by endoscopy, radioisotope scanning with technetium-99m may demonstrate a Meckel's. (A Meckel's is notoriously difficult to see with contrast radiology.)ii) Diverticulitis: Meckel's diverticulitis presents like appendicitis, although if perforation occurs the presentation may resemble a perforated duodenal ulcer. iii) Intussusception: A Meckel's can be the lead point for ileoileal or ileocolic intussusception. iv) Chronic ulceration: Pain is felt around the umbilicus, as the site of the diverticulum is midgut in origin. v) Intestinal obstruction: A band between the apex of the diverticulum and the umbilicus (also part of the vitellointestinal duct) may cause obstruction directly or by a volvulus around it. vi) Perforation* The vast majority of Meckel's are asymptomatic. When found in the course of abdominal surgery, a Meckel's can safely be left alone provided it has a wide mouth and is not thickened.* When there is doubt, it can be resected.* The finding of a Meckel's diverticulum in an inguinal or femoral hernia has been described as Littre's hernia.",

Paralytic ileus. This may be defined as a state in which there is failure of trans- mission of peristaltic waves secondary to neuromuscular failure. The resultant stasis leads to accumulation of fluid and gas within the bowel, with associated distension, vomiting, absence of bowel sounds and absolute constipation. Varieties# Postoperative: a degree of ileus usually occurs after any abdominal procedure and is self-limiting, with a variable duration of 24-72 hours. Postoperative ileus may be prolonged in the presence of hypoproteinaemia or metabolic abnormality (see below).# Infection: intra-abdominal sepsis may give rise to localised or generalised ileus. Resultant adhesions may contribute a mechanical element to the initial neurogenic aetiology.# Reflex ileus: this may occur following fractures of the spine or ribs, retroperitoneal haemorrhage or even the application of a plaster jacket.# Metabolic: uraemia and hypokalemia are the most common contributory factors. Specific treatment is directed towards the cause, but the fol- lowing general principles apply:# The primary cause must be removed. * Gastrointestinal distension must be relieved by decompression.# Close attention to fluid and electrolyte balance is essential.# There is no place for the routine use of peristaltic stimulants. Rarely, in resistant cases, medical therapy with an adrenergic blocking agent in association with cholinergic stimulation, e. g. neostigmine (the Catchpole regimen), may be used, provided that an intraperitoneal cause has been excluded.# If paralytic ileus is prolonged and threatens life, a laparotomy should be considered to exclude a hidden cause and facilitate bowel decompression.",
