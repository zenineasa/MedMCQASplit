Early enteral (EN) nutrition through a nasoduodenal or nasojejunal tube will overcome the problem of delayed gastric emptying. Patients requiring enteral feeding on a long-term basis should have a gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy tube placed, Parenteral nutrition (PN) is indicated when a patient's gastrointestinal tract does not tolerate full enteral feeding or when the access to the GI tract is difficult after head and neck trauma. Parenteral nutrition may be administered as central venous nutrition (expected duration of PN > 7 days) or as peripheral venous nutrition (short-term PN < 7 days). (Note: When GI tract is healthy, use it) Sabiston Textbook of Surgery, 18th ed. OPTIONS FOR ENTERAL FEEDING ACCESSAccess Option. Comments. Nasogastric tube. Short-term use only (<30 days); aspiration risks; nasopharyngeal trauma; frequent dislodgment. Nasoduodenal/nasojejunal tube. Short-term use (<30 days); lower aspiration risks in jejunum; placement challenges (radiographic assistance often necessary). Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Endoscopy skills required; may be used impaired swallowing mechanisms, oropharyngeal or esophageal obstruction, and major facial trauma; aspiration risks; can last 12-24 months; slightly higher complication rates with placement and site leaks. Surgical gastrostomy. Requires general anesthesia and small laparotomy; procedure may allow placement of extended duodenal/jejunal feeding ports; laparoscopic placement possible. Fluoroscopic gastrostomy. Blind placement using needle and T-prongs to anchor to stomach; can thread smaller catheter through gastrostomy into duodenum/jejunum under fluoroscopy. PEG-jejunal tube. Jejunal placement with regular endoscope is operator dependent; jejunal tube often dislodges retrograde; two-stage procedure with PEG placement, followed by fluoroscopic conversion with jejunal feeding tube through PEGDirect percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (DPEJ). Direct endoscopic tube placement with enteroscope; placement challenges; greater injury risks. Used in patients who cannot tolerate gastric feedings or who have significant aspiration risks. Surgical jejunostomy. Commonly carried out during laparotomy; general anesthesia; laparoscopic placement usually requires assistant to thread catheter; laparoscopy offers. Fluoroscopic jejunostomydirect visualization of catheter placement. Difficult approach with injury risks; not commonly done.

Infants who fail to thrive due to gastrointestinal insufficiency associated with short-bowel syndrome, malabsorption, enzyme deficiency, meconium ileus, or idiopathic diarrhea3. Adult patients with short-bowel syndrome secondary to massive small-bowel resection (<100 cm without colon or ileocecal valve, or <50 cm with Intact ileocecal valve and colon). Patients with enteroenteric, enterocolic, enterovesical, or high-output enterocutaneous fistulas (>500 mL/d). Infants who fail to thrive due to gastrointestinal insufficiency associated with short-bowel syndrome, malabsorption, enzyme deficiency, meconium ileus, or idiopathic diarrhea. Patients with normal bowel length but with malabsorption secondary to sprue, hypoproteinemia, enzyme or pancreatic insufficiency, regional enteritis, or ulcerative colitis. Adult patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders such as esophageal dyskinesia after cerebrovascular accident, idiopathic diarrhea, psychogenic vomiting, or anorexia nervosa. Patients with granulomatous colitis, ulcerative colitis, or tuberculous enteritis in which major portions of the absorptive mucosa are diseased. Patients with malignancy, with or without cachexia, in whom malnutrition might jeopardize successful use of a therapeutic option.
