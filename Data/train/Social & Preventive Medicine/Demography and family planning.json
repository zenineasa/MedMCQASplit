When carried out under strict aseptic technique, it should have no risk of moality. In vasectomy, it is customary to remove a piece of vas at least 1 cm after clamping. The ends are ligated and then folded back on themselves and sutured into position, so that the cut ends face away from each other. This will reduce the risk of recanalization at a later date. It is impoant to stress that the acceptor is not immediately sterile after the operation, usually until approximately 30 ejaculations have taken place. During this intermediate period, another method of contraception must be used. If properly performed, vasectomies are almost 100 per cent effective. Following vasectomy, sperm production and hormone output are not affected. The sperm produced are destroyed intraluminally by phagocytosis. This is a normal process in the male genital tract, but the rate of destruction is greatly increased after vasectomy. Vasectomy is a simpler, faster and less expensive operation than tubectomy in terms of instruments, hospitalization and doctor's training. Cost-wise, the ratio is about 5 vasectomies to one tubal ligation. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno: 543",

They comprise four categories. a) Foams: foam tablets, foam aerosols b) Creams, jellies and pastes squeezed from a tube c) Suppositories inseed manually, and d) Soluble films - C-film inseed manually. The spermicides contain a base into which a spermicide is incorporated. The commonly used modern spermicides are \"surface-active agents\" which attach themselves to spermatozoa and inhibit oxygen uptake and kill sperms. The main drawbacks of spermicides are: (a) they have a high failure rate (b) they must be used almost immediately before intercourse and repeated before each sex act (c) they must be introduced into those regions of the vagina where sperms are likely to be deposited, and (d) they may cause mild burning or irritation, besides messiness. The spermicide should be free from potential systemic toxicity. It should not have an inflammatory or carcinogenic effect on the vaginal skin or cervix. No spermicide which is safe to use has yet been found to be really effective in preventing pregnancy when used alone. Therefore, spermicides are not recommended by professional advisers. They are best used in conjunction with barrier methods. Recently there has been some concern about possible teratogenic effects on foetuses, following their use. However, this risk is yet to be confirmed. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno: 546-547",

It is defined as the per cent of eligible couples effectively protected against childbirth by one or the other approved methods of family planning, viz. sterilization, IUD, condom or oral pills. o. Sterilization accounts for over 60 per cent of effectively protected couples. o. Couple protection rate is based on the observation that 50 to 60 per cent of births in a year are of birth order 3 or more. o. Thus attaining a 60 per cent CPR will be equivalent to cutting off almost all third or higher order births, leaving 2 or less surviving children per couple. o. Therefore, the previous National Population Policy was to attain a CPR of 42 per cent by 1990 (end of Seventh Five Year Plan), and 60 per cent by the year 2000. o. However about 60 per cent eligible couples are still unprotected against conception. oA state-wise break-up of the figures reported indicates that while some states notably Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana and Tamil Nadu etc. are forging ahead to cover more than half of their fertility level population by contraception. o.

NRR = 1 can be achieved only if the CPR >60%[?]. Net Reproduction Rate (NRR)o.

NRR of 1 is equivalent to attaining approximately the 2-child norm. If the NRR is less than 1, then the reproductive performance of the population is said to be below replacement level. o. The average number of Daughters a women would bear in her life if she experiences the age-specific fertility (fro daughters) prevailing at the study period, & if her daughters experienced the prevailing rates of mortality. o. If the age schedules of both fertility & mortality remain constant, the Net Reproduction Rate would be a measure of generational Replacement. oE. g.-NRR =1. 1 - Next generation will be 10% larger than the present generation (growth)-NRR =1. 0 - Next generation will be the same as the present generation (replacement level)-NPR =0. 9 - next generation will be 10% smaller than the present generation (depopulation)[?].

It contains only progestogen, which is given in small doses throughout the cycle. o. Commonly used progestogens are norethisterone and levonorgestrel. o. Progestogen-only pills never gained widespread use because of poor cycle control and an increased pregnancy rate. o. Have a definite place in modern day contraception. o. Could be prescribed to older women for whom the combined pill is contraindicated because of cardiovascular risks. o. May also be considered in young women with risk factors for neoplasia. o. Progestogens may lower the high-density lipoproteins may be of some concern. o. Effectiveness of progestogen-only pills is almost as good as that of the combination products. o. In large family planning programmes, the effectiveness and continuation rates are usually lower than in clinical trials. o. Effectiveness may also be affected by certain drugs such as Rifampicin, Phenobarbital & Ampicillin. [?]. Mode of Action of Mini-Pillso. Cerazette suppresses ovulation in 97-100%, whereas other progesterone only pills suppress ovulation in only 40%. o. It forms a thick plug of mucus in the cervical canal and acts as a barrier to sperms. o. It increases tubal peristalsis and fertilized egg reaches the uterine cavity too early for implantation. o. Cerazette containing 75 meg desogestrel has the following advantages over other POPs:-Stringent time compliance not necessary, as it suppresses ovulation in 97%, through pituitary hormone suppression.-No androgenic effects like acne.-No ectopic pregnancy, no effect on carbohydrate or lipid metabolism.-Failure rate only 0. 21 per 100 woman years. It acts through metabolite etonogestrel which binds to progesterone receptorso. Complications of desogestrel are:-Deep venous thrombosis-Pulmonary embolism, breast cancer, liver disease apart from common other complications of progestogenso. Incidence of PID is reduced, though it does not reach the same low level as seen with the barrier method. This effect is due to the thick cervical mucus caused by progestogen, preventing the organisms entering into the uterine cavity. o. Reduced incidence.

Net Reproduction rate (NRR) is defined as number of daughters a newborn girl will bear in her life time assuming fixed age specific fertility and mortality rates. NRR is a demographic indicator. The present level of NRR is 1. 5 in India (1990). NRR of 1 is equivalent to attaining 2 child norm. NRR=1 can be achieved only if at least 60% of eligible couples are effectively practicing family planning. Fertility related statistics. Questions were asked from this topic. Just go through the following important fertility rates. General fertility rate- is the number of live births per 1000 women in the reproductive age group (15-44 or 49 years) in a given year. GFR is a better measure of fertility than crude birth rate. General Marital fertility rate- is the number of live births per 1000 married women in the reproductive age group (15-44 or 49 years) in a given year. Age-specific Fertility rate (ASFR)- is defined as the number of live births per 1000 women in any specified age group in a given year. ASFR shows the fertility pattern. They are also sensitive indicator of family planning achievement. ASFR =Number of live births in a particular age group. Mid year female population of same age groupx 1000. Total fertility rate (TFR)- represents the average number of children a woman would have if she were to pass through her reproductive years bearing children at the same rate as the woman now in each age group.

        "exp": "Postcoital Contraception (Interceptives) Postcoital contraceptive agent interferes with postovulatory events leading to pregnancy and is therefore known as interceptive. It is also known as 'emergency contraception' method used to prevent pregnancy after an unprotected intercourse. Emergency contraception is used following rape, unprotected intercourse or accidental rupture of a condom during coitus taking place around ovulation. It is used in misplaced IUCD and missed pill. These postcoital methods should be used mainly as 'back-up' methods in these conditions and not as a regular contraceptive technique as an ongoing method following every act of sexual intercourse. The preparations available include: Two tablets of relatively high doses of combined pill (Ovran/Eugynon 50), containing 100 mcg EE2 and 1 mg norethisterone, or 500 mcg LNG, taken within 72 h of inter- course followed by two tablets taken 12 h later (Yuzpe and Lancee, 1977). Failure rate--3. 2 per 100 woman years. Mode of action. The hormones may delay ovulation if taken soon after intercourse, cause corpus luteolysis, and bring about cervical mucus changes and endometrial atrophy. Levonorgestrel (LNG). Prostinar tablet contains 0. 75 mg LNG. One tablet should be taken within 72 h of unprotected intercourse and another 12 h later. Alternately, two tablets can be taken as a single dose. The failure rate is 1. 1%. The tablets can be offered up to 120 h but its efficacy de- creases with the longer coital-drug interval. LNG prevents ovulation and causes desynchronization of endometrium through its receptors (luteal phase deficiency). The period may come earlier or delayed. Side effects are those of progestogens. The hormone is not teratogenic in case pregnancy does occur but risk of ectopic pregnancy remains. Advantages It has no oestrogen and its associated side effects. It can be offered to hypeensive, cardiac and diabetic woman. It can be offered to a lactating woman. It can be given as late as 120 h after the unprotected intercourse. Single-dose therapy is an advantage. Contraindicated in liver disease, contains lactate, so allergy to galactose. The drug is also contraindicated in a woman with history of thrombophlebitis and migraine. RU 486 (Mifepristone) RU 486 is a steroid with an affinity for progesterone receptors. It does not prevent feilization but by blocking the action of progesterone on the endometrium, it causes sloughing and shedding of decidua and prevents implantation. It is not teratogenic. A single dose of 25-50 mg is effective in preventing pregnancy in 99. 1% cases (failure rate 0. 9%). It causes delayed menstruation. Ectopic pregnancy is not avoided. The drug is expensive as compared to LNG. Ulipristal. Ulipristal is a synthetic progesterone hormone receptor modular, attaches to progesterone receptor and prevents/delays ovulation and suppresses endometrium, prevents implantation. A 30 mg tablet should be taken within 5 days. Two per cent pregnancy rate is repoed. Side effects are headache and mood changes. Centchroman. Two tablets (60 mg) taken twice in 24 h within 24 h of intercourse can prevent implantation in 99% women. Gn. RH Agonists Daily administration of Gn. RH agonist (buserelin) prevents ovulation. The drug is on trial for its contraceptive effect. Very expensive--has to be given by subcutaneous injection. Prostaglandin Self-administered vaginal suppository containing prostaglandin following an unprotected intercourse, by viue of its luteolytic effect on the ovary and its increased motility effect on fallopian tubes and the uterus, prevents implantation and brings about menstruation. Its specific role as contraceptive is however yet to be established. Copper T IUCD. Inseed within 5 days of intercourse can prevent implantation of a feilized ovum. Advantages of Copper T as emergency contraception are: It can be inseed as late as 5 days after the unprotected Intercourse. It is cheap. Failure rate is 0. 1%. It can remain as ongoing contraceptive method for 3-5 years. Ref: Shaw textbook of gynecology 16th edition Pgno: 269",

The most widely used hormonal device is progestase, which is a T -shaped device filled with 38 mg of progesterone, the natural hormone. The hormone is released slowly in the uterus at the rate of 65 mcg daily. It has a direct local effect on the uterine lining, on the cerl mucus and possibly on the sperms. Because the hormone supply is gradually depleted, regular replacement of the device is necessary. Another hormonal device LNG-20 (Mirena) is a T-shaped IUD releasing 20 mcg of levonorgestrel (a potent synthetic steroid); it has a low pregnancy rate (0. 2 per 100 women) and less number of ectopic pregnancies. Long-term clinical experience with levonorgestrel releasing IUD has shown to be associated with lower menstrual blood loss and fewer days of bleeding than the copper devices. The levonorgestrel releasing IUD has an effective life of 10 years. The hormonal devices would be paicularly valuable for women in developing countries in whom excess blood loss caused by ine devices have been shown to result in significant anemia.

The most widely used hormonal device is progestase, which is a T -shaped device filled with 38 mg of progesterone, the natural hormone. The hormone is released slowly in the uterus at the rate of 65 mcg daily. It has a direct local effect on the uterine lining, on the cerl mucus and possibly on the sperms. Because the hormone supply is gradually depleted, regular replacement of the device is necessary. Another hormonal device LNG-20 (Mirena) is a T-shaped IUD releasing 20 mcg of levonorgestrel (a potent synthetic steroid); it has a low pregnancy rate (0. 2 per 100 women) and less number of ectopic pregnancies. Long-term clinical experience with levonorgestrel releasing IUD has shown to be associated with lower menstrual blood loss and fewer days of bleeding than the copper devices. The levonorgestrel releasing IUD has an effective life of 10 years. The hormonal devices would be paicularly valuable for women in developing countries in whom excess blood loss caused by ine devices have been shown to result in significant anemia. But these devices are more expensive, to be introduced on a wide scale. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno: 548",

Mala N contains 20-30ig of ethinyl estradiol, and 1 mg of nor ethisterone. Mala D contains20-30ig of ethinyl estradiol, and 0. 5 mg of d-norgestrel. Mala N is supplied free of cost through all PHCs and Urban Family Welfare Centres. The pill is given orally for 21 consecutive days, beginning on the 5th day of cycle followed by a break of 7 days during which menstruation occurs. POP pills-- progesterone only pill (mini pill, micro pill) - It contains only progesterone which is given in small doses throughout the cycle. They could be prescribed to older women with cardiovascular risks, where estrogen is conu aindicated, also in young women with risk of neoplasia. Once-a-month (long acting pill) - Combination of long acting estrogen with a progesterone. But the results are disappointing. Post coital contraception: Post coital (morning after) contraception is recommended within 72 hours of an unprotected intercourse. Two methods available are: a) IUDb) Hormonal. Mode of action of oral pills-prevents ovulation. POP renders cervical mucous mucus thick and scanty and thereby inhibiting sperm penetration. They also inhibit tubal motility and delay the transport of sperm and ovum to the uterine cavity. Side effects: 1. Breast tenderness2. Weight gain3. Headache and migraine4. Bleeding disturbances5. Mondial vaginitis6. Nausea, vomiting7. Alteration of lipid metabolism-decrease HDL8. Carcinogenesis -it is seen that there is increased risk of cervical cancer with increasing duration of OCP use. 9. Thrombo embolic disorder, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis. Contra indications: a) Absolute-cancer of breast and genitals, liver disease, previous or present history of thrombo embolism, cardiac abnormalities, congenital hyperlipidemia, undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding. b) Sspecial problems requiring medical surveillance-age over 40 years, smoking and age over 35 years, mild hypertension, chronic renal disease, epilepsy, migraine, diabetes mellitus, first 6 months of lactation, gall bladder disease, acid amenorrheoa.

India was in this stage till 1920. (2) SECOND STAGE (Early expanding) The death rate begins to decline, while the bih rate remains unchanged. Many countries in South Asia, and Africa are in this phase. Bih rates have increased in some of these countries possibly as a result of improved health conditions, and shoening periods of breast-feeding (3) THIRD STAGE (Late expanding) The death rate declines still fuher, and the bih rate tends to fall. The population continues to grow because bihs exceed deaths. India has entered this phase. In a number of developing countries (e. g., China, Singapore) bih rates have declined rapidly. (4) FOUH STAGE (Low stationary) This stage is characterized by a low bih and low death rate with the result that the population becomes stationary. Zero population growth has already been recorded in Austria during 1980-85. Growth rates as little as 0. 1 were recorded in UK, Denmark, Sweden and Belgium during 1980-85. In sho, most industrialized countries have undergone a demographic transition shifting from a high bih and high death rates to low bih and low death rates. (5) FIFTH STAGE: (Declining) The population begins to decline because bih rate is lower than the death rate. Some East European countries, notably Germany and Hungary are experiencing this stage. Demographic cycle is based on: Demographic gap DG = Crude Bih Rate (CBR) - Crude death rate DG stas increasing: Early stage II (Early expanding phase) DG is Maximum: Late stage II (Early expanding phase) DG stas declining: Early stage III (Late expanding PHASE) DG is negative: Stage V (Declining phase) DG is Narrow: Stage I (high Stationary); Stage IV (Low Stationary) Ref: Foundations of community Medicine, GM Dhaarb& I Robbani, 1st edition Park 25th edition Pgno: 530",

The second National Family Health Survey is the outcome of collaborative effos of many organizations. The International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) was designated as the nodal agency for this project by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India, New Delhi. The project was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), with additional suppo from UNICEF. Technical guidance was provided by Macro International and the East-West Center, USA. Responsibility for data collection was entrusted to 13 reputed organizations in India, including some Population Research Centres. As in the earlier survey, the principal objective of NFHS-2 is to provide state and national estimates of feility, the practice of family planning, infant and child moality, maternal and child health and the utilization of health services provided to mothers and children. In addition, the survey includes information on the quality of health and family welfare services and provides indicators of the status of women, women's reproductive health, and domestic violence. Another feature of NFHS-2 is measurement of the nutritional status of women. Height and weight measurements, which were available only for young children in the earlier survey, were extended to cover all eligible women in NFHS-2. In addition, ever-married women and their children below age three had their blood tested for the level of hemoglobin, using the Hemo. Cue instrument. Through these blood tests, for the first time the survey provides information on the prevalence of anemia throughout India. In two metropolitan cities, Delhi and Mumbai, a fuher test was done for children below age three to measure the lead content in their blood. The survey also measured the extent to which households in India use cooking salt that has been foified with iodine. The survey covers a representative sample of about 91, 000 ever-married women age 15-49 from 26 states in India who were covered in two phases, the first staing in November 1998 and the second in March 1999. The survey provides state-level estimates of demographic and health parameters as well as data on various socioeconomic and programmatic dimensions, which are critical for bringing about the desired change in demographic and health parameters. One impoant feature of NFHS-2 is the data on the nutritional status of women and children collected by carrying out blood tests for hemoglobin levels in addition to the measurement of their height and weight.
