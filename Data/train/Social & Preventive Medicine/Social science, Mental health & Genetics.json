A healthful school environment therefore is necessary for the best emotional, social and personal health of the pupils. Schools should also serve as demonstration centres of good sanitation to the community. The following minimum standards for sanitation of the school and its environs have been suggested in India. (1) Location: The school should normally be centrally situated with proper approach roads and at a fair distance from busy places and roads, cinema houses, factories, railway tracks and market places. The school premises should be properly fenced and kept free from all hazards. (2) Site: The site should be on suitable high land, and not subject to inundation or dampness and can be properly drained. The School Health Committee {1961) had recommended that 10 acres of land be provided for higher elementary schools and 5 acres for primary schools with an additional one acre of land per 100 students. In congested areas, the nearest public park or playground should be made available to the students. {3) Structure: Nursery and secondary schools, as far as possible, be single storied. Exterior walls should have a minimum thickness of 10 inches and should be heat resistant. (4) Classroom: Verandhas should be attached to classrooms. No classroom should accommodate more than 40 students. Per capita space for students in a classroom should not be less than 10 sq. ft. (5) Furniture: Furniture should suit the age group of students. It is desirable to provide single desks and chairs. Desks should be of \"minus\" type. Chairs should be provided with proper back-rests, with facilities for desk-work. (6) Doors and windows: The windows should be broad with the bottom sill, at a height of 2'-6\" from the floor level; combined door and window area should be at least 25 per cent of the floor space; windows should be placed on different walls for cross-ventilation; the ventilators should not be less than 2 per cent of the floor area. (7) Colour: Inside colour of the classroom should be white and should be periodically white-washed. (8) Lighting: Classrooms should have sufficient natural light, preferably from the left, and should not be from the front. (9) Water supply: There should be an independent source of safe and potable water supply, which should be continuous, and distributed from the taps. (10) Eating facilities: Vendors other than those approved by the school authorities should not be allowed inside school premises; there should be a separate room provided for mid-day meals. (11) Lavatory: Privies and urinals should be provided one urinal for 60 students and one latrine for 100 students. Arrangements should be separately made for boys and girls.

Septic tanks are not recommended for large communities. (2) Length: The length is usually twice the breadth. (3) Depth: The depth of a septic tank is from LS to 2 m (5-7 ft.). (4) Liquid depth: The recommended liquid depth is only 1. 2 m (4 ft.). (5) Air space: There should be a minimum air space of 30 cm (12 in.) between the level of liquid in the tank and the undersurface of. the cover. (6) Bottom: In some septic tanks, the bottom is sloping towards the inlet end. This facilitates retention of solids (7) Inlet and outlet: There is an inlet and outlet pipe, which are submerged. (8) Cover: The septic tank is covered by a concrete slab of suitable thickness and provided with a manhole. (9) Retention Period: Septic tanks are designed in this country to allow a retention period of 24 hours.
