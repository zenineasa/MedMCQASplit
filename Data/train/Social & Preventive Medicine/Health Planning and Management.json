        "question": "Who is ASHA?",
        "exp": "Ans: B (Community level voluntary worker for heath) Ref: Park 22nd edition. Explanation: ASHA (Accredited social health activist) are involved in health care of community under the National Rural Health Mission. Accredited social health activists (ASHAs) are community health workers instituted by the Government of India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Mo. HFW) as part of the National Rural Health Mission (NRMM The mission began in 2005; full implementation was targeted for 2012. Once fully implemented, there is to be \"an ASHA in every village\" in India, a target that translates into 250. 000 ASHAs in 10 states. Roles and Responsibilities. ASHAs are local women trained to act as health educators and promoters in their communities. Their tasks include; Motivating women to give birth in hospitals. Bringing children to immunization clinics. Encouraging family planning (e. g., surgical sterilization). Treating basic illness. Injury with first aid. Keeping demographic records. Improving village sanitation. ASHAs are also meant to serve as a key communication mechanism between the healthcare system and rural populations. Selection. ASHAs must primarily be female residents of the village that they have been selected to serve, who are likely to remain in that village for the foreseeable future. Married, widowed or divorced women are preferred over women who have yet to marry since Indian cultural norms dictate that upon marriage a woman leaves her village and migrates to that of her husband. ASHAs must have class eight education or higher, preferably be between the ages of 25 and 45, and are selected by and accountable to the gram panchayat (local government). If there is no suitable literate candidate, a semiliterate woman with a formal education lower than eighth standard, may be selected. Remuneration. Although ASHAs are considered volunteers, they receive outcome-based remuneration and financial compensation for training days. For example, if an ASHA facilitates an institutional delivery she receives Rs. 600 and the mother receives Rs. 1400. ASHAs also receive Rs. 150 for each child completing an immunization session and Rs. 150 for each individual who undergoes family planning.",

        "exp": "Ans. d. Handwashing (Ref: Park 22/e p323). In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health, and even eood nutrition. Handwashing. Handwashing is like a 'do-it-yourself vaccine--it involves five simple and effective steps (Wet. Lather, Scrub, Rinse. Dry) you can take to reduce the spread of diarrheal and respiratory illness so you can stay healthy. Medical handwashing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands. Hands should be rubbed together with digits interlocking. Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel. After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids recontaminating the hands from those surfaces. The purpose of handwashing in the health care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ('germs') & avoid transmitting them. The World Health Organization has 'Five Moments' for washing hands:* Before patient care * Before an aseptic task* After environmental contact* After patient care* After exposure to blood-body fluids The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap confers killing action to a hand washing agent. Such killing action may be desired prior to performing surgery or in settings in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. To \"scrub' one's hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching it with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels for drying the hands after washing, and a sterile brush for scrubbing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails. All jewelry should be removed. This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes. Long scrub-times (10 minutes) are not necessary. When rinsing, water on the forearms must be prevented from running back to the hands. Washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap. But soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing HIN1 influenza A virus & Clostridium difficile spores from hands. Effectiveness: Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.",
