Malnutrition in India is mainly attributed to kwashiorkar, marasmus, xerophthalmia, nutritional anemia and endemic goitre. Iron deficiency anemia is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency affecting all age groups in India. The effects are direct and indirect. Direct effects are occurence of frank and subclinical nutrition deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkar, marasmus, vitamin and mineral deficiency. Indirect effects are a high morbidity and moality among young children retarded physical and mental growth. Malnutrition predisposes to infection and infection to malnutrition. Waterlow&; s classification of PEM: It defines two groups- 1. Malnutrition with a retarded growth, in which a drop in height/age ratio points to a chronic condition - shoness/stunting.

They include nightblindness, conjunctiva) xerosis, Bitot's spots, corneal xerosis and keratomalacia. The term \"xerophthalmia\" (dry eye) comprises all the ocular manifestations of vitamin A deficiency ranging from nightblindness to keratomalacia, Given below is a sho description of the ocular manifestations. (a) Nightblindness Lack of vitamin A, first causes nightblindness or inability to see in dim light. The mother herself can detect this condition when her child cannot see in late evenings or find her in a darkened room. Nightblindness is due to impairment in dark adaptation. Unless vitamin A intake is increased, the condition may get worse, especially when children also suffer from diarrhoea and other infections. (b) Conjunctiva xerosis This is the first clinical sign of vitamin A deficiency. Theconjuctiva becomes dry and non-wettable. Instead of looking smooth and shiny, it appears muddy and wrinkled. It has been well described as \"emerging like sand banks at receding tide\" when the child ceases to cry. (c) Bitot's spots Bitot's spots are triangular, pearly-white or yellowish, foamy spots on the bulbar conjunctiva on either side of the cornea. They are frequently bilateral. Bitot's spots in young children usually indicate vitamin A deficiency. In older individuals, these spots are often inactive sequelae of earlier disease. (d). Corneal xerosis This stage is paicularly serious. The cornea appears dull, dry and non-wettable and eventually opaque. It does not have a moist appearance. In more severe deficiency there may be corneal ulceration. The ulcer may heal leaving a corneal scar which can affect vision. (e) Keratomalacia Keratomalacia or liquefaction of the cornea is a grave medical emergency. The cornea (a pa or the whole) may become soft and may burst open. The process is a rapid one. If the eye collapses, vision is lost. EXTRA-OCULAR MANIFESTATIONS These comprise follicular hyperkeratosis, anorexia and growth retardation which have long been recognized. They are non-specific and difficult to quantify. Recent studies seem to indicate that even mild vitamin A deficiency causes an increase in morbidity and moality due to respiratory and intestinal infection.

Khesari dhal (lathyrus sativus), is consumed in pas of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, excessive consumption of which is associated with lathyrism. Pulses contain 20 to 25 per cent of proteins, which is double that found in wheat and three times that found in rice. II') fact, pulses contain more protein than eggs, fish or flesh foods. But in regard to quality, pulse proteins are inferior to animal proteins. Pulse proteins are poor in methionine and to a lesser extent in cysteine. On the other hand they are rich in lysine. Soyabean is exceptionally rich in protein, containing up to 40 per cent. In addition, pulses are rich in minerals and B-group vitamins such as riboflavin and thiamine. In the dry state, pulses do not contain vitamin C. Germinating pulses, however, contain higher concentration of vitamins, especially vitamin C and B vitamins. Fermentation also modifies the nutritive value of pulses. in that the vitamin content paicularly that of riboflavin, thiamine and niacin is enhanced.

An egg weighing 60 grams contains 6 g of protein, 6 g of fat, 30 mg of calcium and 1. 5 mg of iron, and supplies about 70 kcal of energy. Egg proteins have all the nine essential amino acids needed by the body in right propoions. Nutritionists consider egg protein as the best among food proteins. In fact, egg protein is the standard against which the quality of other proteins is compared. Except for vitamin C, egg contains all the fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins in appreciable amounts. Impoant minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc and other trace elements are present in the egg. Barring milk, no other food can supply such a diverse range of nutrients. Net protein utilization (NPU) which combines in a single value the biological value and digestibility, is 100 for egg compared to 80 for meat and 75 for milk. Raw egg white is not assimilated by the intestinal mucosa, therefore it must be cooked before consumption. Boiling destroys 'avidin', a substance which prevents the body from obtaining biotin, one of the B-complex vitamins. Boiled egg is therefore nutritionally superior to raw egg. In recent years the cholesterol content of egg (250 mg/egg) has generated a sense of fear because of the risk of CHD. A reduction in intake of eggs is advised for those at risk of CHD. This should not distract others from eating eggs. Eggs or no eggs, cholesterol is formed in the body endogenously and is controlled by what is known as feedback mechanism.

A balanced diet has become an accepted means to safeguard a population from nutritional deficiencies. In constructing balanced diet, the following principles should be borne in mind: (a) First and foremost, the daily requirement of protein should be met. This amounts to 10-15 per cent of the daily energy intake. (b) Next comes the fat requirement, which should be limited to 15-30 per cent of the daily energy intake (c) Carbohydrates rich in natural fibre should constitute the remaining food energy. The dietary pattern varies widely in different pas of the world. It is generally developed around the kinds of food produced (or impoed) depending upon the climatic conditions of the region, economic capacity, religion, customs, taboos, tastes and habits of the people. It takes into account 95-98% of population. Balanced diets formulated by the Indian Council of Medical Research are given in Annexure II at the end of this chapter.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. Phosphatase test Pasteurization is defined as the heating of milk to such temperatures and for such periods of time as are required to destroy any pathogens that may be present while causing minimal changes in the composition, flavor and nutritive value. The process of pasteurization is named after Louis Pasteur who discovered that spoilage organisms could be inactivated in wine by applying heat at temperatures below its boiling point. The process was later applied to milk and remains the most important operation in the processing of milk. Pasteurization uses temperatures below boiling point since at temperatures above the boiling point for milk, casein micelles will irreversibly aggregate (or \"curdle\"). Pasteurization kills nearly 90 % of the bacteria in milk including the more heat-resistant tubercle bacillus and the Q fever organisms. It does not kill thermoduric bacteria nor the bacterial spores. Therefore, despite pasteurization, with subsequent rise in temperature, the bacteria are bound to multiply. In order to check the growth of microorganisms, pasteurized milk is rapidly cooled to 4 deg C. It is kept cold until it reaches the consumer. Hygenically produced pasteurized milk has a keeping quality of not more than 8 to 12 hours at 18 deg C. Note that unlike sterilization, pasteurization is not intended to kill all pathogenic micro-organisms in the food or liquid. Instead, pasteurization aims to reduce the number of viable pathogens so they are unlikely to cause disease (assuming the pasteurization product is refrigerated and consumed before its expiration date). Commercial-scale sterilization of food is not common because it adversely affects the taste and quality of the product. Methods of pasteurization: 1 ). Holder (Vat) method: In this method, milk is kept at 63-66 deg C for at least 30 min. and then quickly cooled to 5 deg C. This method is recommended for small and rural communities. HTST method (High Temperature and Short Time method): In this process, milk is rapidly heated to a temperature of nearly 72 deg C, is held at that temperature for not less than 15 seconds, and is then rapidly cooled to 4 deg C. This is now the most widely used method. UHT method (Ultra-high temperature method). Milk is rapidly heated usually in 2 stages (the second stage usually being under pressure) to 125 deg C for a few seconds only. It is then rapidly cooled and bottled. UHT increases the shelf life of milk. Tests of pasteurized milk: a. Phosphatase test: Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme naturally present in all raw milks, which is used as an indicator of proper milk pasteurization. Complete pasteurization will inactivate the enzyme to below levels which are detectable by conventional methods. Because the heat stability of ALP is greater than that of pathogens which may be present in milk, the enzyme serves as an indicator of product safety. The phosphatase test shows whether milk has been properly pasteurized or it has been contaminated with raw milk after pasteurization. Standard plate count: The bacteriological quality of pasteurized milk is determined by the standard plate count. Most countries in the West enforce a limit of 30, 000 bacterial count per ml of pasteurized milk. Coliform count: Coliform organisms are usually completely destroyed by pasteurization, and therefore, their presence in pasteurized milk is an indication of improper pasteurization or post pasteurization contamination. The standard in most countries is that coliform be absent in 1ml of milk. Also Know: Methylene blue reduction test. This test is carried out on the milk accepted for pasteurization. It is an indirect method for detection of microorganisms in milk. The methylene blue reduction test is based on the fact that the color imparted to milk by the addition of a dye such as methylene blue will disappear more or less quickly. The removal of the oxygen from milk and the formation of reducing substances during bacterial metabolism causes the color to disappear. The agencies responsible for the oxygen consumption are the bacteria. Though certain species of bacteria have considerably more influence than others, it is generally assumed that the greater the number of bacteria in milk, the quicker will the oxygen be consumed, and in turn the sooner will the color disappear. Thus, the time of reduction is taken as a measure of the number of organisms in milk. Thus in this test, the milk which remains blue the longest is considered to be of the best quality.",

        "exp": "Ergot Unlike Aspergillus, ergot is not a storage fungus, but a field fungus. Foodgrains such as bajra, rye, sorghum, and wheat have a tendency to get infested during the flowering stages by the ergot fungus (Claviceps purpurea). Fungus grows as a blackish mass and the seeds become black and irregular and are harvested along with food grains. Consumption of ergot infested grain leads to ergotism. Sporadic outbreaks of ergot poisoning in human population have been repoed from time to time in areas where bajra is consumed as a staple. The symptoms are acute but rarelyfatal and include nausea, repeated vomiting, giddiness and drowsiness extending sometimes for periods upto 24 to 48 hours after the ingestion of ergoty grain. In chronic cases, painful cramps in limbs and peripheral gangrene due to vasoconstriction of capillaries have been repoed. However, the long-term effects of consuming small amounts of the Toxin are not known. A disquieting feature is that the recently introduced high-yielding varieties of bajra are more susceptible to infestation. Ergot-infested grains can be easily removed by floating them in 20 per cent salt water. They can also be removed by hand-picking or air floatation. The upper safe limit for the ergot alkaloids has been estimated to be 0. 05 mg per 100 grams of the food material. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno: 694",

Malnutrition in India is mainly attributed to kwashiorkar, marasmus, xerophthalmia, nutritional anemia and endemic goitre. Iron deficiency anemia is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency affecting all age groups in India. The effects are direct and indirect. Direct effects are occurence of frank and subclinical nutrition deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkar, marasmus, vitamin and mineral deficiency. Indirect effects are a high morbidity and moality among young children retarded physical and mental growth. Malnutrition predisposes to infection and infection to malnutrition.

Of these alpha-tocopherol is biologically the most potent. Vitamin E is widely distributed in foods. By far the richest sources are vegetable oils, cotton-seed, sunflower seed, egg yolk and butter. Foods rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids are also rich in vitamin E. The usual plasma level of vitamin E in adults is between 0. 8 and 1. 4 mg per 100 ml. While there is no doubt that man requires tocopherol in his diet, there is no clear indication of dietary deficiency. The role of vitamin E at the molecular level is little understood. The current estimate of vitamin E requirement is about 0. 8 mg/g of essential fatty acids. This roughly works out to 8-10 mg tocopherol per day depending on the edible oil used. Recently the cytotoxic effect of vitamin E on human lymphocytes in vitro at high concentrations has been repoed.

A balanced diet has become an accepted means to safeguard a population from nutritional deficiencies. In constructing balanced diet, the following principles should be borne in mind: (a) First and foremost, the daily requirement of protein should be met. This amounts to 10-15 per cent of the daily energy intake. (b) Next comes the fat requirement, which should be limited to 15-30 per cent of the daily energy intake (c) Carbohydrates rich in natural fibre should constitute the remaining food energy. The dietary pattern varies widely in different pas of the world. It is generally developed around the kinds of food produced (or impoed) depending upon the climatic conditions of the region, economic capacity, religion, customs, taboos, tastes and habits of the people. It takes into account 95-98% of population.

Symptoms- nausea, repeated vomiting, giddiness, drowsiness extending up to 24-48 hrs after ingestion of ergoty grain.

Very large quantities of milk can be pasteurized by this method. 3. UHT method- ultra high temperature method. Pasteurization kills 90% of bacteria in milk including the more heat resistant tubercle bacillus and Q fever organism. But it will not kill thermoduric bacteria or bacterial spores. Despite pasteurization, bacteria are bound to multiply. In order to check the growth of microorganisms, pasteurized milk is rapidly cooled to 4 deg C.

The test is based on the fact that raw milk contains an enzyme called phosphatase which is destroyed on heating at a temperature which corresponds closely with the standard time and temperature required for pasteurization. At 60 deg C for 30 minutes phosphatase is completely destroyed. Consequently, the test is used to detect inadequate pasteurization or the addition of raw milk. (2) Standard plate count: The bacteriological quality of pasteurized milk is determined by the standard plate count. Most countries in the West enforce a limit of 30, 000 bacterial count per ml of pasteurized milk. (3) Coliform count: Coliform organisms are usually completely destroyed by pasteurization, and therefore, their presence in pasteurized milk is an indication either of improper pasteurization or post-pasteurization contamination.

The process stas with soaking the paddy in hot water at 65 deg celcius for 3-4 hours, which swells the grain. This is followed by draining of water and steaming the soaked paddy in the same container for 5-10min. The paddy is then dried and later homepounded and milled. During the steaming process, a greater pa of the vitamins and minerals present in the outer aleurone layer of rice grain are driven into inner endosperm. With subsequent milling, the nutrients are not removed. There is also no loss of B group vitamin (niacin)which gets washed away at the end of cooking while draining away excess of water. The heat used in drying hardens the rice grain and makes the grain more resistant to insect invasion and more suitable for storage than raw rice. The starch also gets gelatinised which improves the keeping quality of rice.

Malnutrition in India is mainly attributed to kwashiorkar, marasmus, xerophthalmia, nutritional anemia and endemic goitre. Iron deficiency anemia is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency affecting all age groups in India. The effects are direct and indirect. Direct effects are occurence of frank and subclinical nutrition deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkar, marasmus, vitamin and mineral deficiency. Indirect effects are a high morbidity and moality among young children retarded physical and mental growth. Malnutrition predisposes to infection and infection to malnutrition. Waterlow&; s classification of PEM: It defines two groups- 1. Malnutrition with a retarded growth, in which a drop in height/age ratio points to a chronic condition - shoness/stunting.

Discussion: The quality of protein is assese23d by comparison to the reference protein which is usually egg protein. Two methods of ass of protein quality are amino acid score and Net Protein Utilization.# Amino acid score- measure of the concentration of each essential amino acid in the test protein expressed as % of that amino acid in the reference protein.# Net Protein Utilization- it is a product of digestibility coefficient and biological value divided by 100. The NPU gives a more complete expression of protein quality than amino acid score. NPU = N retained by the body/N intake x 100. In calculating protein quality, 1 gm of protein is assumed to be equvivalent to 6. 25 g of N. If NPU is low, the protein req is high and vice versa.

There are several methods of pasteurization. Three are widely used: (1) Holder (Vat) method: In this process, milk is kept at 63-66 deg C for at least 30 minutes, and then quickly cooled to 5 deg C. Vat method is recommended for small and rural communities. In larger cities, it is going out of use. (2) HTST method: Also known as \"High Temperature and Sho Time Method\". Milk is rapidly heated to a temperature of nearly 72 deg C, is held at that temperature for not less than 15 seconds, and is then rapidly cooled to 4 deg C. This is now the most widely used method. Very large quantities of milk per hour can be pasteurized by this method. (3) UHT Method: Also known as \"ultra-high temperature method. \" Milk is rapidly heated usually in 2 stages (the second stage usually being under pressure) to 125 deg C for a few seconds only. It is then rapidly cooled and bottled as quickly as possible. Pasteurization is a preventive measure of public health impoance and corresponds in all respects to the modern principles of supplying safe milk. Pasteurization kills nearly 90 per cent of the bacteria in milk including the more heat-resistant tubercle bacillus and the Q fever organisms. But it will not kill thermoduric bacteria nor the bacterial spores. Therefore, despite pasteurization, with subsequent rise in temperature, the bacteria are bound to multiply. In order to check the growth of microorganisms, pasteurized milk is rapidly cooled to 4 deg C. It should be kept cold until it reaches the consumer. Hygienically produced pasteurized milk has a keeping quality of not more than 8 to 12 hours at 18 degC. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno: 692",

At 60 deg C for 30 minutes phosphatase is completely destroyed. Consequently, the test is used to detect inadequate pasteurization or the addition of raw milk.

Most countries in the West enforce a limit of 30, 000 bacterial count per ml of pasteurized milk.

Incubation period of some pathogens are: Varicella (Chickenpox) - usually 14 to 16 days. Measles (Rubeola) - usually 10 days from exposure to onset of fever, and 14 days to appearance of rash. Rubella (German Measles) - 2 to 3 weeks; usually 18 days. Mumps - 2 to 3 weeks; usually 18 days. Influenza -18 to 72 hours. Diphtheria - 2 to 6 days. Pertussis - usually 7 to 14 days, but not more than 3 weeks. Meningiococcal Meningitis - usually 3 to 4 days, but may vary from 2 to 10 days. Tuberculosis - the time from receipt of infection to the development of a positive tuberculin test ranges from 3 to 6 weeks, and thereafter, the development of disease depends upon the closeness of contact, extent of the disease and sputum positivity of the source case and host parasite relationship. Thus the incubation period of tuberculosis varies from weeks, months or years. Polio - usually 7 to 14 days. Hepatitis A -15 to 45 days (usually 25 to 30 days). Hepatitis B - 45 to 180 days. Hepatitis C - 40 to 120 days. Cholera - from few hours up to 5 days, but commonly 1-2 days. Typhoid - usually 10-14 days, but it may be as short as 3 days or as long as 3 weeks depending on the dose of bacilli ingested. Amoebiasis - 2 to 4 weeks. Ascariasis - about 2 months. Filariasis - 8 to 16 months. Rabies - highly variable from. 4 days to many years but usually 3- 8 weeks. Yellow fever - 3 to 6 days (6 days recognized under International Health Regulations)",

A balanced diet is defined as one which contains a variety of foods in such quantities and propoions that the need for energy, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, fats, carbohydrate and other nutrients is adequately met for maintaining health, vitality and general well-being and also makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand sho duration of leanness. A balanced diet has become an accepted means to safeguard a population from nutritional deficiencies. In constructing balanced diet, the following principles should be borne in mind: (a) First and foremost, the daily requirement of protein should be met. This amounts to 10-15 per cent of the daily energy intake. (b) Next comes the fat requirement, which should be limited to 15-30 per cent of the daily energy intake (c) Carbohydrates rich in natural fibre should constitute the remaining food energy. The dietary pattern varies widely in different pas of the world. It is generally developed around the kinds of food produced (or impoed) depending upon the climatic conditions of the region, economic capacity, religion, customs, taboos, tastes and habits of the people. It takes into account 95-98% of population.

The technique recommended by the Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore is known as the hot soaking process. The process stas with soaking the paddy (unhusked rice) in hot water at 65 to 70 deg. C for 3 to 4 hours, which swells the grain. This is followed by draining of water and steaming the soaked paddy in the same container for 5 to 10 minutes. The paddy is then dried and later homepounded or milled. During the steaming process, a greater pa of the vitamins and minerals present in the outer aleurone layer of the rice grain are driven into the inner endosperm. With subsequent milling, even to a high degree, the nutrients are not removed. During the drying process, the germ gets attached more firmly to the grain. In addition, the heat used in drying hardens the rice grain. It results in the grain becoming more *resistant to insect invasion and more suitable for storage than raw rice. The starch also gets gelatinized which improves the -keeping quality of rice. The serious disadvantage of parboiling is the development of a peculiar smell or \"off flavour\" which some consumers do not relish. Modern methods of parboiling rice have been developed by which the finished product does not give any bad odour. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno: 665",

Iodized salns most economical, convenient and effective means of mass prophylaxis inendemic areas. Under the national IDD control activities, the Government of India proposed to completely replace common salt with iodized salt in a phased manner. The National Institute of Nutrition at Hyderabad has come out with a new product, common salt foified with iron and iodine. Community trials have been launched to examine the efficacy of the \"two-in-one\" salt. Iodized oil: Another method which has demonstrated its efficacy for controlling goitre is intramuscular injection of iodized oil (mostly poppy-seed oil). Scientists at the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad have now successfully developed a process to produce iodized oil in safflower or safola oil. The advantage of the injection procedure is that an average dose of 1 ml will provide protection for about 4 years. Although more expensive than iodated salt, this method has the advantage that it can be applied rapidly and in places where iodization of salt is not feasible or iodated salt is in sho supply. However, the difficulty with. this procedure is one of logistics, i. e., in reaching every victim or potential victim of! DD for the injection, which means that this approach is less practicable.. Iodized oil, oral: The oral administration of iodine as iodized oil or as sodium iodate tablets, is technically simpler than the injection method. Limited research has found that these procedures are effective against goitre but more costly than intramuscular injections. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno: 681",

Hygienically produced pasteurized milk has a keeping quality of not more than 8-12 hours at 18 deg C. Tests of pasteurized milk:- 1. Phosphatase test 2. Standard plate count 3.

But in regard to quality, pulse proteins are inferior to animal proteins. Pulse proteins are poor in methionine and to a lesser extent in cysteine. On the other hand they are rich in lysine. Soyabean is exceptionally rich in protein, containing up to 40 per cent. In addition, pulses are rich in minerals and B-group vitamins such as riboflavin and thiamine. In the dry state, pulses do not contain vitamin C. Germinating pulses, however, contain higher concentration of vitamins, especially vitamin C and B vitamins.

Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 m.
