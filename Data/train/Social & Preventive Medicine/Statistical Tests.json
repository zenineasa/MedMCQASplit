        "question": "In a study following interpretation are obtained: Satisfied, Very satisfied, Dissatisfied. Which type of scale is this?",
        "exp": "Ans is 'b' i. e. Ordinal Repeat from All India 07, AIIMS May 2005, Nov. 2003. Statistical data can be of two types -Qualitative data -Quantitative data. Qualitative Data. In such data there is no notion of magnitude or size of the variables as they cannot be measured. Variables can be categorized according to some characteristics or quality. eg: Sex, occupation marital status, education level, vaccinated or not vaccinated, acquired the disease or not, died or cured, grades in the class. The qualitative data can be placed on 2 scales -Nominal. Ordinal. Nominal scale. Nominal scale data are divided into qualitative categories or groups, such as male / female, black / white, died / cured, attacked/not attacked, vaccinated/not vaccinate, urban/sub urban/rural. There is no implication of order or ratio, means that the data cannot be placed in a meaningful order. Ordinal Scale. Here the data can be placed into categories that can be rank ordered (eg. students may be ranked 1st / 2nd / 3rd / 4th in their class or into grades A/B/C, the activity of an animal can be rated on a scale of 1 to 6, hardness scale for water etc.). However, there is no information about the size of the interval ie no conclusion can be drawn about whether the difference between the first and second students is the same as the difference between the second and third. Variables in the form of mild, moderate and severe (or very satisfied, satisfied and dissatisfied) are analyzed by ordinal scale as they can be arranged in a meaningful order but there is no information about the size of the interval between them. Quantitative data. The quantitative data have a magnitude ie they can be measured. Eg. - height, weight, blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, temperature, number of children in a family etc. Quantitative data can be measured on 2 scales. Interval. Ratio scales. Interval scale. Interval scale data are like ordinal data in that they can be placed in a meaningful order; in addition, they have meaningful intervals between items, which can be measured. eg: Temperature on the Celsius scale (the difference between 80 degand 70deg is the same as between 40 degand 30 deg. CHowever, interval scale data do not have an absolute zero, ratios of the scores are not meaningful ie 80deg C of Celsius temperature is not twice as hot as 40degC because 0degC does not indicate a complete absence of heat. Ratio ScaleA ratio scale has the same properties as an interval scale, however, because it has an absolute zero, meaningful ratio do exist. eg. weights, time, blood pressure, temperature on the Kelvin scale (not Celsius scale) On the Kelvin scale, zero degrees indicate an absolute absence of heat, just as a zero pulse indicates an absolute absence of heartbeat. Thus we can say that 400 K is twice as hot as 200 K. Dichotomous Scale is a type of nominal scale in which nominal data fall into only two groups eg black / white, died / cured, failed / passed.",

        "exp": "Ans. d. Multistage sampling (Ref: BK Mahajan 6/e p100-101; Park 23/e p849, 20/e p752-753). In Multistage sampling, sampling procedure is carried out in several stages using random sampling techniques. Multistage sampling is used when the population units arranged in hierarchal groups (Sampling schools, then sections, then students). In a sampling technique, every 10th unit of population is chosen. This is type of systematic random sampling. Types of Sampling Random Sampling. Non-random sampling. Synonyms* Probability samplingQ* Non-purposive sampling* Non -probability sampling* Purposive sampling. QTypes* Simple random sampling* Systematic random sampling* Stratified random sampling* Multistage random sampling* Multiphase random sampling* Cluster random sampling* Convenience sampling* Quota sampling* Snow-ball sampling* Clinical trial sampling. Types of Random Sampling. Simple Random Sampling: Every unit of population has equal and known chance of being selected. QIs also knowm as 'unrestricted random sampling'Applicable for small, homogenous and readily available populations. Used in clinical trials. Methods of Simple random sampling* Lottery method* Random number tables* Computer software. Systematic Random Sampling: Based on sampling fraction: Every Kth unit is chosen in the population list, where K is chosen by sampling interval. QSampling Interval (K) = Total no. of units in population/ Total no. of units in sample. Applicable for large, non-homogenous populations where complete list of individuals is available. For example, if there is a population of 1000 from which sample of 20 is to be chosen, then K = 1000/20 - 50; thus every 50th unit will be included in the sample (i. e. 1st, 51st, 101st, so on...) First unit among first 50 is chosen by simple random sampling. Stratified Random Sampling: Non-homogenous population is converted to homogenous groups/classes (strata); sample is drawn from each strata at random, in proportion to its size. QApplicable for large non-homogenous population. QGives more representative sample than simple random sampling. QNone of the categories is under or over-represented. QFor example. In a population of 1000, sample of 100 is to be drawn for Hemoglobin estimation; first convert non-homogenous population is converted to homogenous strata (i. e. 700 males and 300 females), then draw 70 males and 30 females randomly respectively. Multistage Random Sampling: Is done in successive stages: each successive sampling unit is nested in the previous sampling unit. QAdvantage: Introduces flexibility in sampling. QFor example, in large country surveys, states are chosen, then districts, then villages, then every 10th person in village as final sampling unit. Multiphase Random Sampling: Is done in successive phases; part of information is obtained from whole sample and part from the sub-sample. QFor example, in a TB survey, Mantoux test done in first phase, then X-ray done in all Mantoux positives, then sputum examined in all those with positive X-ray findings. Cluster Random Sampling: Applicable when units of population are natural groups or clusters. Use in India: Evaluation of immunization coverage. QWHO technique used: 30 x 7 technique (total =210 children)QWHO technique used in CRS: 30 x 7 technique (total = 210 children)30 clusters, each containing 7 children, who are 12-23 months age and are completely immunized for primary immunization (till Measles vaccine)QClusters are heterogeneous within themselves but homogenous with respect to each other Sampling interval is also calculated in CRSAccuracyQ: Low error rate of only +- 5%Limitation: Clusters cannot be compared with each other. QTypes of Non-Random Sampling. Convenience Sampling: Patients are selected, in part or in whole, at the convenience of the researcher; no/limited attempt to ensure that sample is an accurate representation of population. QFor example, standing at a shopping mall and selecting shoppers as they walk by to fill out a survey. Quota Sampling: Population is first segmented into mutually exclusive sub-groups (quotas), just as in stratified sampling; then judgment is used to select the units from each group non-randomly. Is a type of convenience sampling. Snow-ball Sampling: A technique for developing a research sample where existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances; thus the sample group appears to grow like a rolling snowball. Is often used in hidden populations which are difficult for researchers to access, e. g. drug users or commercial sex workers. QClinical Trial Sampling",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e. Student t-test Let's first revise the various statistical tests: Chi-Square test: Chi-square test is used for qualitative data; data in which there is no notion of magnitude or size of the attribute. The data are classified by counting the individuals having the same characteristic or attribute (i. e. persons with the same characteristic are counted to form two groups such as vaccinated or not vaccinated, cured or not cured, on drug or not on drug, taken iron supplements or not taken iron supplements). The data is in the form of proportions. Student t-test. Is used for Quantitative data i. e. the data has a magnitude and is normally distributed in the population (i. e. continuous data) e. g. each individual has one measurement from a continuous spectrum or range such as body temperature, height, weight, blood pressure, mean bone density etc. Student t-test is of three types: Student t-test for single small sample. Student t-test for independent samples (also k/a unpaired test). Student t-test for paired sample (paired t - test). Paired t - test. It compares the means of two paired samples (when two readings, are taken from a same group, before and after an intervention). Analysis of variance (ANOVA). It is used for same datas as the t-test. Whereas t-test is appropriate for making just one comparison (between two sample means, or between a sample mean and hypothesized population mean), ANOVA is used when more than one comparison is to be made (when means of more than two groups are being compared). In the question since the attribute (mean bone density) is a quantitative data and we have only two samples the test of significance used would be student t-test",

Application of test: o It is applied to find the significance of difference between two means, when sample size is less than 30. o It is applied on a standard population either as: Unpaired 't'test: Applied when data is unpaired, i. e. when separate observations are made on individuals of two separate groups, and these need to be compared: Null hypothesis is assumed. Observed diference between means of two samples is found. Standard error or difference between two means is calculated. t value is estimated. This is the ratio between points 2 and 3. Degrees of freedom are next calculated. Calculated values are compared with the 't' table values at the calculated degree of freedom (option d )P values are obtained and if it is more than 0-05, it has no significance. Paired test: Is applied to paired data, when each individual gives a pair of observations such as: when observations are made before and after the play of a factor e. g. pulse rate before and after a drug. Further, it proceeds similar to the unpaired test. Comnwinlv used Statistical tests. Data. Qualitative(Proportions, percentage, fractions). Quantitative(mean & SD. of BP. Sugar, cholesterol etc).
