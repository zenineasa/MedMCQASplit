Both are long term measures involving intensive nutrition education of the public and community paicipation. Since vitamin A can be stored in the body for 6 to 9 months and liberated slowly, a sho term, simple technology had been evolved by the National Institute of Nutrition at Hyderabad (India) for community based intervention Against nutritional blindness, which has subsequently been adopted by other countries. Vitamin A deficiency treatment: Vitamin A on days 1, 2 and 14 each (for age >12 months, give 200, 000. IU; for age 6-12 months, give 100, 000 IU; for age 0-5 months, give 50, 000.
