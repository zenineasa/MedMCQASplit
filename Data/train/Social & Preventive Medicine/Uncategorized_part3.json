        "question": "Recall bias is most commonly associated with which study design:",
        "exp": "Case control study Recall bias is associated with Case-control studies. Park writes- \"When cases and controls are asked questions about their past history, it may be more likely for the cases to recall the existence of ceain events or factors than the controls who are healthy persons. For example, those who have had a myocardial infarction might be more likely to remember and recall ceain habits or events than those who have not. Thus cases may have a different recall of past events than controls\" Recall bias is an error due to the differences in accuracy or completeness of recall to memory of past events or experiences. As a hypothetical example, suppose one is studying the possible relationship of congenital malformations to prenatal infections. A case-control study is conducted and interview is done of mothers of children with congenital malformations (cases) and mothers of children without malformations (controls). Each mother is questioned about infections she may have had during the pregnancy. A mother who has had a child with a bih defect tries to identify some unusual event that occurred during her pregnancy with that child. She wants to know whether the abnormality was caused by something she did. Why did it happen? Such a mother may even recall an event, such as a mild respiratory infection, that a mother of a child without a bih defect may not even notice or may have forgotten completely. This type of bias is known as recall bias. Bias is said to have occurred when there is a systematic difference between the results from a study and the true state of affairs. Bias may be introduced at all stages of the research process, from study design, through to analysis and publication. Bias can create a spurious association (i. e. overestimation of an effect) or mask a real one (underestimation of an effect). While appropriate statistical methods can reduce the effect of bias, they may not be able to eliminate it entirely. Innumerable number of bias have been listed. Bias associated with coho study: Selection Confounding Interviewer's bias Bias associated with Case-control study: Selection Confounding Recall bias Berkesonian bias Interviewer's bias Interviewer bias is a type of information bias that arises when an interviewer consciously or unconsciously elicits inaccurate information from study subjects. Interviewer bias can result in differential error, which can seriously disto disease-exposure associations, if the interviewer is aware of the disease status and exposure hypothesis in a case-control study, or if the interviewer is aware of the exposure status and outcome hypothesis in a coho study. In the former case, the interviewer may probe more deeply for evidence of exposure among cases than among controls. In the latter case, the interviewer may try to elicit evidence of health effects more assiduously in exposed than in unexposed coho members. Selection bias occurs when patients included in the study are not representative of the population to which the results will be applied. Confounding bias occurs when we find a spurious association between a potential risk factor and a disease outcome or miss a real association between them because we have failed to adjust for any confounding variables. A confounding variable or confounder is an exposure variable that is related to both the outcome variable (e. g. disease) and to one or more of the other exposure variables. For example in the study of the role of alcohol in the etiology of esophageal cancer, smoking is the confounding factor because it is associated with the consumption of alcohol and it is also an independent risk factor for esophageal cancer. Thus the effects of alcohol consumption on esophageal cancer can only be determined when the influence of smoking is neutralized by matching. Berkesonian bias: It occurs when patient admission rates vary between the experimental and control groups, especially in studies that use hospitalized patients for both groups. For example, this type of bias is present when hospitalized patients with the risk factor (experimental group) are admitted at a higher rate than the control group.",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Specificity Concept of sensitivity and specificity can be understood as follows: Imagine a study evaluating a new test that screens people for a disease. Each person taking the test either has or does not have the disease. The test outcome can be positive (predicting that the person has the disease) or negative (predicting that the person does not have the disease). The test results for each subject may or may not match the subject's actual status. In that setting: True positive: Sick people correctly diagnosed as sick False positive: Healthy people incorrectly identified as sick True negative: Healthy people correctly identified as healthy False negative: Sick people incorrectly identified as healthy. Specificity A specificity of 100% means that the test recognizes all actual/true negatives - for example, all healthy people will be recognized as healthy. Because 100% specificity means no positives are erroneously tagged, a positive result in a high specificity test is used to confirm the disease. The maximum can trilly be achieved by a test that claims everybody healthy regardless of the true condition. Therefore, the specificity alone does not tell us how well the test recognizes positive cases. We also need to know the sensitivity of the test. A test with a high specificity has a low type I error rate. Sensitivity A sensitivity of 100% means that the test recognizes all actual positives - for example, all sick people are recognized as being ill. Thus, in contrast to a high specificity test, negative results in a high sensitivity test are used to rule out the disease. Sensitivity alone does not tell us how well the test predicts other classes (that is, about the negative cases).",

The new drug policy gives emphasis on complete treatment in diagnosed cases of malaria rather than one single dose presumptive treatment to suspected cases of malaria (waiting for the diagnosis) to avoid chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum. o All fever cases should be investigated for malaria either by microscopy or by Rapid diagnostic Test (RDT) for both vivax & falciparum, i. e., combo RDT. o Fuher treatment is as follows: - 1). For plasmodium vivax: - 3 days chlorquine plus 14 days Primaquine. 2) For plasmodium falciparum:? All cases should be given Aemisinin combination therapy (ACT) which includes Aesunate (for 3 days) along with sulfadoxin-pyrimethamine (on day 0) plus single dose primaquine. 3) Treatment of mixed infection: - Should be treated as falciparum malaria. 4) When microscopy results are not available within 24 hours or if RDT for only falciparum is used: - a)P. falciparum RDT positive --> Treat as falciparum malaria (as above). b)P. falciparum RDT negative --> Send blood slide to laboratory, and give chloroquine for 3 days, and await microscopy results: - i) +ve for vivax --> Primaquine for 14 days. ii) +ve for falciparum --> Treatment of falciparum malaria as above. 5). Treatment of severe malaria: - Severe manifestations (e. g., Unconsciousness, Convulsions, Coma, Metabolic acidosis etc) can develop in P. falciparum infection. Treatment is as follows: - i) Sta with parentral aimisinin derivative (aesunate, aemether, aeether) or quinine. ii).

Phase 1 no viruses circulating among animals have been repoed to cause infections in humans. In Phase 2 an animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans, and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat. In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassoant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassoant virus able to cause \"community-level outbreaks. \" Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion. Phase 5 is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. While most countries will not be affected at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent. Phase 6, the pandemic phase, is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5.

The key objectives of the programme are: protecting children from classroom hunger, increasing school enrolment and attendance, improved socialisation among children belonging to all castes, addressing malnutrition, and social empowerment through provision of employment to women. The scheme has a long history especially in the state of Tamil Nadu introduced statewide by the then Chief Minister K. Kamaraj in 1960s and later expanded by M. G. Ramachandran government in 1982 has been adopted by most of the states in India after a landmark direction by the Supreme Cou of India on November 28, 2001. The success of this scheme is illustrated by the tremendous increase in the school paicipation and completion rates in the state of Tamil Nadu. 12 crore (120 million) children are so far covered under the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, which is the largest school lunch programme in the world. Allocation for this programme has been enhanced from Rs 3010 crore to Rs 4813 crore (Rs 48 billion 1. 3 million) in 2006-2007 A mid day meal should provide at least one-third of the total energy requirement, and half of the protein need A mid day school meal consists of (g/day/ child): Cereals and millets: 75; Pulses: 30; Oils and fats: 8; Leafy vegetables: 30; Non-leafy vegetables: 30",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Pig In Japanese encephalitis, pigs are the amplifier host (they themselves didn't manifest ove symptoms but circulate the virus) Japanese encephalitis/ Japanese B encephalitis The Japanese encephalitis virus is a virus from the family Flaviviridae. Domestic pigs and wild birds (herons) are reservoirs of the virus; transmission to humans may cause severe symptoms. One of the most impoant vectors of this disease is the mosquito Culex tritaeniorhynchus. This disease is most prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Far East. Japanese encephalitis has an incubation period of 5 to 15 days and the vast majority of infections are asymptomatic Only 1 in 250 infections develop into encephalitis. Severe rigors mark the onset of this disease in humans. Fever, headache and malaise are other non-specific symptoms of this disease which may last for a period of between 1 and 6 days. Signs which develop during the acute encephalitic stage include neck rigidity, cachexia, hemiparesis, convulsions and a raised body temperature between 38 and 41 degrees Celsius. Moality of this disease varies but is generally much higher in children. Increased microglial activation following JEV infection has been found to influence the outcome of viral pathogenesis. Activated microglia secrete cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), which can cause toxic effects in the brain. Additionally, other soluble factors such as neurotoxins, excitatory neurotransmitters, prostaglandin, reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species are secreted by activated microglia. The causative agent Japanese encephalitis virus is an enveloped virus of the genus flavivirus and is closely related to the West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus. The positive sense single stranded RNA genome is packaged in the capsid which is formed by the capsid protein. The outer envelope is formed by envelope (E) protein and is the protective antigen. It aids in entry of the virus to the inside of the cell. Japanese Encephalitis is diagnosed by detection of antibodies in serum and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) by IgM capture ELISA. Viral antigen can also be shown in tissues by indirect fluorescent antibody staining.",

Its good sources are oat, flaxseeds, peas, beans, apple, citrus fruits, carrots, barley and psyllium. Insoluble fibre: It promotes movement of material through digesve system and increases stool bulk. Its good sources are wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts and vegetables. Advantages of fibres Dietry fibre contribute bulk by absorbing water 1-15 mes of its own weight and thus hastens the passage through the gut, decreasing the transient me. By increasing the bulk, it provides a larger volume of indigesble material to colon. Dietary fibre is known to be associated with reduced incidence of coronary artery diseases.

Measles (also sometimes known as English Measles) is spread through respiration (contact with fluids from an infected person's nose and mouth, either directly or through aerosol transmission), and is highly contagious -- 90% of people without immunity sharing living space with an infected person will catch it. An asymptomatic incubation period occurs nine to twelve days from initial exposure and infectivity lasts from two to four days prior, until two to five days following the onset of the rash (i. e. four to nine days infectivity in total). An alternative name for measles in English-speaking countries is rubeola, which is sometimes confused with rubella (German measles); the diseases are unrelated The classical symptoms of measles include four-day fevers and the three Cs -- cough, coryza (head cold) and conjunctivitis (red eyes). The fever may reach up to 40 degC (104 degF). Koplik's spots seen inside the mouth are pathognomonic (diagnostic) for measles, but are not often seen, even in real cases of measles, because they are transient and may disappear within a day of arising. The characteristic measles rash is classically described as a generalized, maculopapular, erythematous rash that begins several days after the fever stas. It stas on the head before spreading to cover most of the body, often causing itching. The rash is said to \"stain\", changing color from red to dark brown, before disappearing. The measles rash appears two to four days after initial symptoms, and lasts for up to eight days. Complications Complications with measles are relatively common, ranging from relatively mild and less serious diarrhea, to pneumonia, Otitis media and acute encephalitis (and rarely subacute sclerosing panencephalitis); corneal ulceration leading to corneal scarring. Complications are usually more severe in adults who catch the virus.",

It is the weakest criteria of causal association because:? i) Most diseases are due to multiple factors with no possibility of one to one relationship, e. g., lung cancer is associated with smoking, asbestos, nickle and air pollution. ii) A single cause can give rise to more than one disease, e. g., smoking can cause, Ca lung, Bronchitis, Bladder Ca, CHD, peptic ulcer. So, o Requirement of specificity is the most difficult criteria to establish. o But lack of specificity does not negate the causal relationship because:? i) Though single cause can cause more than one disease, it may be associated in causation of disease under study, e. g., smoking is associated with so many diseases but it has been proved as the most impoant risk factor in causation of lung cancer. ii) Though most of the disease are due to multiple factor, disease under study may be associated with the risk factor under study, e. g., Lung cancer has multiple etiological risk factors, but smoking has been proved to be the most impoant risk factor.

        "question": "True about simple randomization is: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Every person has an equal chance of selection In simple random sampling, every unit of population has equal chances of being selected Randomized controlled trial (RCT) It is a type of scientific experiment - a form of clinical trial - most commonly used in testing the safety (or more specifically, information about adverse drug reactions and adverse effects of other treatments) and efficacy or effectiveness of healthcare services (such as medicine or nursing) or health technologies (such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices or surgery). The key distinguishing feature of the usual RCT is that study subjects, after assessment of eligibility and recruitment, but before the intervention to be studied begins, are randomly allocated to receive one or other of the alternative treatments under study. Random allocation in real trials is complex, but conceptually, the process is like tossing a coin. After randomization, the two (or more) groups of subjects are followed up in exactly the same way, and the only differences between the care they receive, for example, in terms of procedures, tests, outpatient visits, follow-up calls etc. should be those intrinsic to the treatments being compared. The most impoant advantage of proper randomization is that it minimizes allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments. \" The advantages of proper randomization in RCTs include: \"It eliminates bias in treatment assignment, \" specifically selection bias and confounding. \"It facilitates blinding (masking) of the identity of treatments from investigators, paicipants, and assessors. \" \"It permits the use of probability theory to express the likelihood that any difference in outcome between treatment groups merely indicates chance. There are two processes involved in randomizing patients to different interventions. First is choosing a randomization procedure to generate an unpredictable sequence of allocations; this may be a simple random assignment of patients to any of the groups at equal probabilities, may be \"restricted, \" or may be \"adaptive. \" A second and more practical issue is allocation concealment, which refers to the stringent precautions taken to ensure that the group assignment of patients are not revealed prior to definitively allocating them to their respective groups. Non-random \"systematic\" methods of group assignment, such as alternating subjects between one group and the other, can cause \"limitless contamination possibilities\" and can cause a breach of allocation concealment. Randomization procedures An ideal randomization procedure would achieve the following goals: Equal group sizes for adequate statistical power, especially in subgroup analyses. Low selection bias. That is, the procedure should not allow an investigator to predict the next subject's group assignment by examining which group has been assigned the fewest subjects up to that point. Low probability of confounding (i. e., a low probability of \"accidental bias\"), which implies a balance in covariates across groups. Simple randomization: This is a commonly used and intuitive procedure, similar to \"repeated fair coin-tossing. \" Also known as \"complete\" or \"unrestricted\" randomization, it is robust against both selection and accidental biases. However, its main drawback is the possibility of imbalanced group sizes in small RCTs. It is therefore recommended only for RCTs with over 200 subjects. Restricted randomization: To balance group sizes in smaller RCTs, some form of \"restricted\" randomization is recommended. The major types of restricted randomization used in RCTs are: Permuted-block randomization or blocked randomization: a \"block size\" and \"allocation ratio\" (number of subjects in one group versus the other group) are specified, and subjects are allocated randomly within each block.

C: Preserving traditional lifestyle Preserving traditional lifestyles is a primordial level of prevention Levels of Prevention Model This model, advocated by Leaven and Clark in 1975, has influenced both public health practice and ambulatory care delivery worldwide. This model suggests that the natural history of any disease exists on a continuum, with health at one end and advanced disease at the other. The model delineates three levels of the application of preventive measures that can be used to promote health and arrest the disease process at different points along the continuum. The goal is to maintain a healthy state and to prevent disease or injury. It has been defined in terms of four levels: Primordial prevention Prevention of the emergence or development of risk factors in population or countries in which they have not yet appeared. Effos are directed towards discouraging children from adopting harmful lifestyles. Primary prevention An action taken prior to the onset of disease, which removes the possibility that the disease will ever occur. It includes the concept of positive health, that encourages the achievement and maintenance of an \"acceptable level of health that will enable every individual to lead a socially and economically productive life. A holistic approach Secondary prevention Action which halts the progress of a disease at its incipient stage and prevents complications. The domain of clinical medicine An imperfect tool in the transmission of disease More expensive and less effective than primary prevention Teiary prevention All measures available to reduce or limit impairment and disabilities, minimize suffering caused by existing depaures from good health and to promote the patient's adjustment to irremediable conditions. Modes of intervention Health promotion Specific protection Early diagnosis and treatment Disability limitation Rehabilitation Health promotion The process of enabling people to in areas to control over and to improve health Health education Environmental modifications Nutritional interventions Lifestyle and behavioral changes Specific protection Immunization Specific nutrients Chemoprophylaxis Protection against occupational hazards Protection from carcinogens Avoidance of allergens Rehabilitation The combined and coordinated use of medical, social, educational and vocational measures for training and retraining the individual to the highest possible level of functional ability.

The chlorine demand of the water should be estimated. It is the amount of chlorine that is needed to destroy bacteria and to oxidize all the organic matter and ammoniacal substances present in water. Chlorine demand of water is the difference between the amount of chlorine added to the water and the amount of residual chlorine remaining at the end of specific period of contact (usually 60 minutes) at a given temperature and pH of the water. The point at which the chlorine demand of the water is met is called break point chlorination. If fuher chlorine is added beyond break point, free chlorine begins to appear in water. The presence of free residual chlorine for a contact period of at least one hour is esential to kill bacteria and virus. The minimum recommended concentration of free chlorine is 0. 5mg/1 for one hour. This free residual chlorine provides margin of safety against subsequent microbial contamination. The sum of the chlorine demand of the specific water plus the free residual chlorine of. 5 mg/L constitutes the correct does of chlorine to be applied. It is woh noting here that recommended residual chlorine level for drinking water is 0. 5 mg/ litre, while for swimming pool sanitation it is 1. 0 mg/ litre and for water bodies & post disaster it is 0. 7 mg/litre.",

These states are Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Evaluation of programme: There are two main types of indicators in leprosy control a). Operational indicators These are related to case-finding, treatment, relapses & disabilities for e. g. Relapse rate - One of the best indicators of the efficacy of drug regimen Case detection ratio - No. of cases registered / no. of cases estimated. Propoion of children among newly detected cases. Propoion of multibacillary cases on regular treatment during the year. Propoion of female cases among newly detected cases. Treatment completion/cure rate. Propoion of new cases presenting with grade 2 disability/impairment at the time of diagnosis. Propoion of treatment defaulters. Propoion of patients who develop new/additional disability during MDT. bjlipidemiological indicators: To assess the impact of the actions taken with regard to the problem reduction. Incidence rate - most sensitive index of transmission of disease. Only index for measuring the effectiveness of the measure taken i. e. reduction of transmission. Prevalence - This provides a measure of case load & is useful in planning of the treatment services. So it is obvious that increasing no. of children affected will indicate ineffective leprosy control.

Health education is the act of getting people to do something for themselves to attain better health. Health education involves teaching about reducing health risk factors, increasing a person' s level of wellness and taking specific protective health measures. There are 4 well-known approaches to health education: 1. Regulatory approach (Managed prevention) - There are occasions when people are indifferent to their own health thus endangering the health of the community, in which case the regulatory or legal approach seeks to protect the health of the public through the enforcement of laws and regulations. - The regulatory approach involves governmental intervention designed to alter human behaviour through regulations ranging from prohibition to imprisonment. This approach seeks change in health behaviour and improvement in health through a variety of external controls or legislations. E. g. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, compulsory seat belts 2. Service approach - The service approach involves providing necessary health services needed by the people as and when required through the spirit of volunteerism or social obligation. * - This is mainly the responsibility of the health depament and health workers both in government and non? government health agencies. - The service or administrative approach aims at providing all the health facilities needed by the community so that the people will make use of them in order to improve their own health. - The service approach will be a failure when it is not based an the \"felt needs\" of the people. 3. Health education approach - The health education approach involves changing the behavioral patterns of the people through planned learning experiences without conflicting with the masses. It involves proper communication and motivation of the community to make the right decision in order to attain health. - Though it is a good method, it is a slow perseverance to have permanent and enduring results. E. g. cessation of smoking, use of safe water supply, feility control. 4. Primary health care approach - The primary health care approach involves enabling individuals to become self-reliant in matters of health. - This is a radically new approach staing from the people with their full paicipation and active involvement in the planning and delivery of health services based on principals of primary health care, viz community involvement and intersectoral coordination. - The underlying objective is to help individuals become self-reliant in matters of health.

It is a highly hydrophobic, colorless, crystalline solid with a weak, chemical odor. It is nearly insoluble in water but has a good solubility in most organic solvents, fats, and oils. DDT does not occur naturally, but is produced by the reaction of chloral (CC13. CH0) with chlorobenzene (C6. H5. C1) in the presence of sulfuric acid, which acts as a catalyst. In insects it opens sodium ion channels in neurons, causing them to fire spontaneously, which leads to spasms and eventual death. Insects with ceain mutations in their sodium channel gene are resistant to DDT and other similar insecticides. DDT resistance is also conferred by u p-regulation of genes expressing cytochrome P450 in some insect species.",

The simplest is the bih rate, more accurately the crude bih rate, which is the fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of bihs in a population during a given period and the denominator is the total number of person-years lived by the population during that period. The latter expression is generally approximated by the size of the population at the mid-point of the period multiplied by the length of the period in years. The rate is usually stated per 1, 000. Like other rates in which the population at the mid-point of the period is used as the denominator of the fraction this is sometimes called the central bih rate. Where the term \"bih rate\" is used without qualification, the live bih rate is generally meant and only live bihs appear in the denominator. The total bih rate based on live bihs and late foetal deaths is sometimes calculated. Legitimate bih rates and illegitimate bih rates with legitimate and illegitimate bihs respectively in the denominator are computed and the illegitimacy ratio, the number of illegitimate bihs per 1, 000 total bihs, is frequently used. These rates and ratios are generally based on live bihs. To compare the feility of different populations, standardized bih rates are often used to eliminate the effect on the bih rate of ceain differences in structure of the population (most commonly the age and sex structure). The child-woman ratio, most commonly the number of children aged 0 to 4 per 1, 000 women of childbearing age, i. e., 15 or 20 to 44 or 49, is used as an index of feility when reliable bih statistics are not available.",

        "question": "All of the following are true about standard error ofmean except:",
        "exp": "As the sample size increases, standard error will also increase Formula for standard error of mean is: S. E.= Standard detion /Vsample size Thus as the formula shows, the standard error is dependent on the size of the samples. Standard error is inversely related to the square root of the sample size, so that larger the sample size, the smaller will be the sampling error. This is reason why the results of larger studies or surveys are more trusted than the results of smaller ones. Standard error of mean If we take repeated samples from the same population or universe, the results obtained from one sample will differ to some extent from the results of another sample. This type of variation from one sample to another is called sampling error. It occurs because data were gathered from a sample rather from the entire population. If we take a random sample (1) from the population, and similar samples over and over again we will find that every sample will have a different mean( If we make a frequency distribution of all the sample means drawn from the same population, we will find that the distribution of the mean is nearly a normal distribution and the mean of the sample means practically the same as the population mean 44 The standard detion of the means is a measure of the sample error and is given by the formula cst\\\\ITI which is called the standard error or the standard error of the mean. Since the distribution of the means follows the pattern of a normal distribution, 95 percent of the sample means will lie within limits of two standard error on either side of the true or population means. Thus standard error of mean helps to judge whether the mean of a given sample is within the set confidence limit or not. The standard error indicates how reliable an estimate of the mean is likely to be. This is known as inferential statistics i. e. inferences are drawn about a population from study of just a sample from the same population. For example a researcher wants to forecast the results of an election on the basis of an opinion poll, or predict the effectiveness of a new drug for all patients after it has been tested on only a small sample. Now the problem in sampling is that it is unlikely that a sample will perfectly represent the population it is drawn from i. e. a statistic (such as the sample mean) will not exactly reflect its corresponding parameter (the population mean). For example is a sample of 100 people is drawn from a population with a mean height of 6 feet, it would not be expected that the mean height of the sample would exactly be 6 feet. This is known a sampling error- which is not an error, but just natural, expected random variation. So when we want to study a population, we draw a sample from the population under study. We calculate the mean of the sample. Now the next question arises that - How accurate is the mean of our sample? In order to answer these questions, we calculate the standard error of the mean and set up 'confidence limits' within which the mean (I), of the population is likely to lie. Example: Let's suppose, a random sample of 25 males, is drawn. Their mean temperature is 98. 14 deg. F with a standard detion of 0. 6. What can we say of the true mean of the population from which the sample is drawn. We use the standard en-or as the yard stick: S. E. 27 = 0. 6 TNIS = 0. 12 We now set up confidence limits on the basis of the normal curve distribution. If the limits are set out at twice the standard error from the mean (95 percent confidence limits) the range of the population mean would be 98. 14 (2 x 0. 12) = 97. 90 deg. to 98. 38 deg.",

Regulatory approach (Managed prevention) There are occasions when people are indifferent to their own health thus endangering the health of the community, in which case the regulatory or legal approach seeks to protect the health of the public through the enforcement of laws and regulations. The regulatory approach involves governmental intervention designed to alter human behaviour through regulations ranging from prohibition to imprisonment. This approach seeks change in health behaviour and improvement in health through a variety of external controls or legislations. E. g. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, compulsory seat belts. 2. Service approach The service approach involves providing necessary health services needed by the people as and when required through the spirit of volunteerism or social obligation. This is mainly the responsibility of the health depament and health workers both in government and non? government health agencies. The service or administrative approach aims at providing all the health facilities needed by the community so that the people will make use of them in order to improve their own health. The service approach will be a failure when it is not based on the \"felt needs\" of the people. 3. Health education approach o The health education approach involves changing the behavioral patterns of the people through planned learning experiences without conflicting with the masses. It involves proper communication and motivation of the community to make the right decision in order to attain health. Though it is a good method, it is a slow perseverance to have permanent and enduring results. E. g. cessation of smoking, use of safe water supply, feility control. 4. Primary health care approach The primary health care approach involves enabling individuals to become self-reliant in matters of health. This is a radically new approach staing from the people with their full paicipation and active involvement in the planning and delivery of health services based on principals of primary health care, viz community involvement and intersectoral coordination. The underlying objective is to help individuals become self-reliant in matters of health. o Mass media is a method of health communication.",

Amongst the given options two have emotional components: Attitude Effects of emotional components (affect) on attitude also show the impoance of affective content. In general, people with positive mood tend to like things more than people in a neutral or negative mood. Attitude is usually fixed and stable --> not influenced by motivation. Practive (Habit) Practice refers to an established way of doing things. It is the usual way of action and on accustomed act performed without thinking. While the term habit is used far individual actions, the term practice is generally used for a set of fixed hahits. Practices (Habits) are usually formed as a result of positive emotional valence (intrinsic attractiveness). Examples ofliabit/practice in the field of health include (few examples): i) Good habits: hand washing prior to eating, exercise etc ii) Bad habits: Smoking, drinking. By motivation, bad habits can be conveed into good ones --> Habits are influenced hr, motivation.

        "exp": "The median A median is described as a value separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. It does not depend on the total and number of items. To obtain the median, the data is first arranged in an ascending or descending order of magnitude, and then the value of the middle observation is located, which is called median. For example, diastolic BP of 9 individuals was as follows - 83, 75, 81, 79, 71, 95, 75, 77, 84. Now data is arranged in ascending order - 71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 95. Here, 79 is the middle observation that is separating the upper four values from the lower four values, so it is the median. If there are two values in the middle instead of one, the median is worked out by taking the average of the two middle values. For example, If diastolic BP of 10 individuals is as follows 83, 75, 81, 79, 71, 95, 75, 77, 84, 90. Data is arranged in ascending order - 71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 90, 95 Here two values are separating the upper half of values from the lower half. So the median here is - Median = (79 + 81) / 2 = 80. Advantage of median The value of the median is not affected by abnormal very high or very low value. Taking the example as was taken in the mean - The income of 7 people per day in rupees is as follows 5, 5, 5, 7, 10, 20, 300 = (Total 352) Here mean = 50. 3, median = 7. The value of mean has affected seriously, whereas the median is not affected, and the median is more nearer to the truth. So, the median is used when the distribution of values is skewed (deviated) with some small number of very high values -> median is used for skewed distribution.",

Lyssaviruses have helical symmetry, with a length of about 180 nm and a cross-sectional diameter of about 75 nm. These viruses are enveloped and have a single stranded RNA genome with negative-sense. The genetic information is packaged as a ribonucleoprotein complex in which RNA is tightly bound by the viral nucleoprotein. The RNA genome of the virus encodes five genes whose order is highly conserved: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and the viral RNA polymerase (L). From the point of entry, the virus is neurotropic, traveling quickly along the neural pathways into the central nervous system (CNS), and then fuher into other organs. The salivary glands receive high concentrations of the virus thus allowing fuher transmission. The virus recovered from naturally occurring cases of rabies is called street virus and is pathogenic for all mammals and shows a long variable incubation period (20-60 days in dogs).",

Deaths at this age are due to a peculiar set of diseases and conditions to which the adult population is less exposed or less vulnerable.

Reservoir o Any person, animal, ahropod, plant, soil or substance in which an infectious agent lives and multiplies & metabolizes. o Infectious agent is dependent on reservoir for survival. o It reproduces in reservoir in such manner that it can be transmitted to susceptible host. A reservoir acts as a source of infection when a person acquire infection directly from reservoir. So, a resrvoir may sometimes act as a source, i. e., source may be a pa of reservoir sometime (not always). Example o Source & reservoir are same --> Tetanus spores survive in soil (reservoir) and a person acquires infection directly from soil (source). So, soil acts as reservoir as well as source. o Source & reservoir different --> In typhoid, bacillus survives and multiplies inside human cases or carriers (act as reservoir), but immediate source of infection is feces or urine of patients, or contaminated food, water or milk (act as source). o So, source may or may not be a pa of reservoir.

Objectives - Initial survey to identify magnitude of problem in the country; - Production and supply of iodized salt to the endemic regions; - Health Education and Publicity; - To undeake monitoring of the quality of iodized salt assessing urinary iodine excretion pattern and monitoring of Iodine Deficiency disorder; and - Re-survey in goiter endemic regions after five years continuous supply of iodized salt to assess the impact of the control programme. In 1992, the National Goiter Control Programme (NGCP) was renamed as National Iodine Deficiency Disorder Control Programme (NIDDCP). Policy On the recommendations of Central Council of Health in 1984, the Government took policy decision with the goal of \"Universal Iodization of Salt\" by 1992 and staing of Salt depament in the Ministry of Industry. Pilot Project against Micronutrient Malnutrition - Micronutrient malnutrition is a global public health problem. There is problem of iodine, iron, zinc, ad fluorine deficiency leading to many clinical manifestations in the population. - The pilot project programme against micronutrient malnutrition is being staed in the year 1995 in Assam along with four other states - Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal and Gujarat. - This project has been merged with NIDDCP. Objectives To access the magnitude of fluorosis and dental caries beside assessing the iron and Vitamin-A deficiency in the project area; To assess and improve iron and vitamin-A status in school going children, adolescent, boys and girls, non-pregnant women, adult males and geriatric population; To launch extensive information, education and communication strategy through mass media to improve the dietary habits of the populations; and To study zinc level in various food products and soil.
