        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Retain the vaccine in the ice box To solve this question one should have the basic knowledge of cold chain. The cold chain The cold chain is a system of storage and transpo of vaccines at low temperature from the manufacturer to the actual vaccination site. o The cold chain system is necessary because vaccine failure may occur due to failure to store and transpo under strict temperature control. In cold chain following equipments are used:? a) Walk in cold rooms (WIC) Located at state/regional (4-5 districts) level. Can store vaccine upto 3 months. Usual temprature is + 2 to +8degC. Also contains walk in freezers (WIF) which has temprature - 20 to - 40degC b) Large deep freezers (DF) & Large ice -lined refrigerators (ILR) Located at all districts. Can store vaccines upto 1 month. Temprature of large ice-lined refrigerator is +2 to +8degC and is used to store vaccines (other than OPV & measles). Temprature of large deep freeze is -20degC to - 40degC and is used for making ice packs and to store OPV and measles. c) Small DF & Small ILRs Provided at PHC level Function & temprature are same as in large DF (for small DF) and large ILR (for small ILR). Can store vaccines upto 1 month. d) Cold boxes, vaccine carriers and day carriers Provided at subcentres. Are used for transpoation of vaccines. A vaccine carrier contains 16-20 ls and a day carrier contains 6-8 ls of vaccines. Full frozen ice packs are used in these carriers (a vaccine carrier contains 4 full frozen ice packs and a day carrier contains 2 fully frozen ice packs). Maintain the temprature at +2 to +8degC. Can store vaccine upto 48-72 hours. e) Dial thermameter For temprature monitoring of ILR (twice daily) Now see the question o This peripheral worker has returned one day late (24 hours). He must be carrying any of the carrier device mentioned above (e. g., ice box). He can put the vaccine in ice box which can store vaccine upto 48-72 hours and next morning vaccines can be transferred to ILR for storage. Following information has been added in 22nd/e of Park o Deep freezer maintain temperature between -15degC to -25degC (previously it was -20deg C to -40degC). At PHC deep freezers are used only for making Ice packs and are not used for storing any of the universal immunization programme (UIP) vaccines (previously it was also used to store OPV and measles). o ICE - lined refrigerator (ILR) is used to store all UIP vaccines (previously it was not used to store OPV and measles vaccine). All vacines must be kept in the basket of ILR along with diluents. Arrange the vaccines in order (from top to bottom) hepatitis B, DP & TT, BCG, measles, OPV. Discard any frozen hepatitis B, DPT and TT. Measles and OPV can be kept over two rows of empty icepacks on the floor of ILR.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: 150 mg/L Softening of the water is recommended at level of hardness of more than 150 mg/ liter of calcium carbonate (>3 meq/ liter) Hardness in water It is defined as concentration of multivalent cations. Multivalent cations are cations (positively charged metal complexes) with a charge greater than 1+. They mainly have the charge of 2+. These cations include Ca2+ and Mg2+. Common calcium-containing minerals are calcite and gypsum. A common magnesium mineral is dolomite (which also contains calcium). The following equilibrium reaction describes the dissolving/formation of calcium carbonate scales: Ca. CO3 + CO2 + H20 Ca2+ + 2. HCO3- The total water hardness, including both Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, is repoed in pas per million (ppm) or mass/volume (mg/L) of calcium carbonate (Ca. CO3) in the water. Although water hardness usually measures only the total concentrations of calcium and magnesium (the two most prevalent divalent metal ions), iron, aluminium, and manganese can also be present at elevated levels in some locations. The presence of iron characteristically confers a brownish (rust-like) colour to the calcification, instead of white (the color of most of the other compounds). Classification and level of hardness in meq/1 Soft water: Less than 1 (< 50 mg/1) Moderately hard: 1-3 (50-15 mg/1) Hard water: 3-6 (150-300 mg/1) Very hard water: Over 6 (> 300 mg/1) Water softening is the reduction of the concentration of calcium, magnesium, and ceain other metal cations in hard water. These \"hardness ions\" can cause a variety of undesired effects including interfering with the action of soaps, the build up of limescale, which can foul plumbing, and galvanic corrosion. Conventional water-softening appliances intended for household use depend on an ion-exchange resin in which hardness ions are exchanged for sodium ions. Water softening may be desirable where the source of water is hard (when the hardness exceeds 3 meq/1 or 150 mg/1).",

Measurements of malaria in the pre eradication era a) Spleen rate: Defined as the percentage of children between 2 & 10 years of age showing enlargement of spleen. Spleen rate is widely used for measuring the endemicity of malaria in a community. b) Av. enlarged spleen: A refinement of spleen rate, denoting the average size of spleen. c) Parasite rate: Defined as on the percentage of children between the ages of 2 & 10 yrs showing malarial parsites in their blood films. d) Parasite density index: Average degree of parasitimia e) Infant parasite rate Percentage of infants showing malarial parasites in their blood films.

This column is easy to form, you do it by successively accumulating the relative frequencies of each of the various intervals. In the above table the cumulative percentage for the first three intervals is 8. 8 + 33. 3 + 17. 5 = 59. 6 and we can say that 59. 6% of the children in the data set have a weight of 39. 5 lb or less. Or, as another example, 96. 4% of children weight 69. 5 lb or less. The cumulative relative frequency can be presented graphically. This type of curve is called a cumulative frequency graph or OGIVE. To construct such a graph, we place a point representing the cumulative relative frequency and the points are connected with straight lines. The cumulative frequency graph provides a class of impoant statistics known as percentiles or percentile scores. For example, the 90th percentile is the numerical value that exceeds 90% of the values in the data set and is exceeded by only 10% of them. As another example, the 80th percentile is that numerical value that exceeds 80% of the values contained in the data set and is exceeded by 20% of them, and so on.

Health Education, Environmental modifications, Nutritional interventions, Lifestyle & behavioural changes 2) Specific Protection: Is targeting the prevention of disease through a specific intervention o Primary level of prevention is applied when 'risk factors are present but disease has not yet taken place' o It signifies 'intervention in the Pre pathogenesis Phase of a disease/ health problem' Secondary Level of Prevention: o It halts the progress of disease at its' incipient stage and prevents complications Modes of Intervention: 1) Early Diagnosis: Detection of disturbances while biochemical, functional and morphological changes are still reversible or prior to occurrence of manifest signs & symptoms 2) Treatment: Shoens period of communicability, reduces moality and prevents occurrence of fuher cases (secondary cases) or any long term disability o Secondary level of prevention is applied when disease has possibly set in: It attempts to arrest the disease process, seek unrecognized disease & treat it before irreversibility and reverse communicability of infectious diseases o National Health Programmes by Govt. of India mostly operate at Secondary level of prevention o Secondary prevention is an imperfect tool in control of transmission of disease: It is more expensive and less effective than primary prevention It is an impoant level of prevention for diseases like Tuberculosis, Leprosy and STDs Teiary Level of Prevention: Is applied when disease has advanced beyond early stages: It aims to reduce or limit impairments & disabilities, minimize suffering caused by existing depaures from good health o Modes of Intervention: 1) Disability Limitation: It 'prevents the transition of disease from impairment to handicap' 2) Rehabilitation: Training & retraining of an individual to the highest possible level of functional ability; It can be medical, vocational, social or psychological o Teiary level of prevention signifies 'intervention in late pathogenesis phase'",

That means measles predisposes malnutrition and vice versa. All cases of severe measles and all cases of measles in areas with high case-fatality rates should be treated with vitamin A, as many children develop an acute deficiency of vitamin A, which may lead to keratomalacia and blindness from corneal scarring. So, vitamin 'A' should be administered along with the measles vaccine. A high dose of vitamin A is given immediately on diagnosis of measles and repeated the next day. The recommended age-specific daily doses are 50, 000 IU for infants aged < 6 months, 100, 000 IU for infants aged 6-11 months, and 200, 000 IU for children aged 12 months. If the child has clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency (Such as Bitot's spots) a third dose should be given 4-6 weeks later.",

Park Simple random sampling Simple random sampling, also, known as 'unrestricted random sampling'; is applicable for small, homogenous, readily available population and is used in clinical trials. In simple random sampling each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance. So, each individual has the same probability of being chosen at any stage during the sampling process. For example:? Let us assume you had a school with 1000 students, divided equally into boys and girls, and you wanted to select 100 of them for fuher study. You might put all their names in a bucket and then pull 100 names out. Not only does each person have an equal chance of being selected, we can also easily calculate the probaility of a given person being chosen, since we know the sample size (n) and population (N) and it becomes a simple matter of division - n/N or 100/1000 = 0. 10 (10%). This means that every student in the school has a 10% or 1 in 10 chance of being selected using this method. Systematic random sampling In order to do systematic random sampling, the individuals in a population are arranged in a ceain way (for example, alphabetically). A random staing point is selected and then every nth (for example 10th or 15th) individual is selected for the sample. That is, after arranging the individuals in ceain pattern (e. g., alpabetically) a staing point is chosen at random, and choices thereafter at regular intervals. For example, suppose you want to sample 8 houses from a street of 120 houses. 120/8 = 15, So every 15th house is chosen after a random staing point between 1 and 15. If the random staing point is 11, then the houses selected are- 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 101, and 116. In contrast to simple random sampling, some houses have a larger selection probabily e. g., in this question 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 100 and 116. While the remaining number can not be selected. Stratified random sampling When sub-populations vary considerably, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently. Stratification is the process of grouping members of the population into relative hemogenous subgroups before sampling. The strata should be mutually exclusive, every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. Then systematic random sampling method is applied within each stratum. Population - Stratification - Systematic random sampling - Sample. This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error. For example, suppose in a population of 1000, sample of 100 is to be drawn for Hb estimation, first conve the population into homogenous striata (e. g., 700 males and 300 females), then draw 70 males and 30 females by doing systematic random sampling.",

Secular (long-term) trends: Graphing the annual cases or rate of a disease over a period of years (Decades or centuries) shows long-term or secular trends in the occurrence of the disease. We commonly use these trends to suggest or predict the future incidence of a disease. Secular is influenced by population features e. g. - Change of degree of susceptibility e. g. by immunization - Socioeconomic - Environmental sanitation and - Nutritional status of a population. 2. Periodic (cyclic variation) Where disease occurrence for a period then increase again in cyclic pattern e. g. measles in prevaccination era occur every 2 - 3 years. 3. Seasonality By graphing the occurrence of a disease by week or month over the course of a year or more we can show its seasonal pattern. Example: the number of repoed cases of influenza typically increases in winter. Others increase in summer e. g. food poisoning and diarrhea Seasonal patterns may suggest hypotheses about: - How the infection is transmitted. - What behavioral factors increase risk, and - Other possible contributors to the disease or condition. 4.

It has become customary to regard as significant when p is less than 0. 05 (1 in 20) and more significant, when P is less than 0. 01.

B: 1, 000 live bihs For international comparisons, the WHO committee on the prevention of Perinatal Moality and Morbidity recommend a more precise formulation: \"Late foetal and early neonatal deaths weighing over 1000 gram at bih, expressed as a ratio per 1000 live bihs weighing over 1000 gram at bih\" Perinatal moality (PNM)/ Perinatal death It refers to the death of a fetus or neonate and is the basis to calculate the perinatal moality rate. Variations in the precise definition of the perinatal moality exist specifically concerning the issue of inclusion or exclusion of early fetal and late neonatal fatalities. The World Health Organization defines perinatal moality as the \"number of stillbihs and deaths in the first week of life per 1, 000 live bihs\", but other definitions have been used Fetal moality refers to stillbihs or fetal death. It encompasses any death of a fetus after 20 weeks of gestation or 500 gm. In some definitions of the PNM early fetal moality (week 20-27 gestation) is not included, and the PNM may only include late fetal death and neonatal death. Fetal death can also be divided into death prior to labor, antenatal (antepaum) death, and death during labor, intranatal (intrapaum) death Early neonatal moality refers to a death of a live-born baby within the first seven days of life, while late neonatal moality covers the time after 7 days until before 28 days. The sum of these two represents the neonatal moality. Some definitions of the PNM include only the early neonatal moality. Neonatal moality is affected by the quality of in-hospital care for the neonate. Neonatal moality and postneonatal moality (covering the remaining 11 months of the first year of life) are reflected in the Infant Moality Rate. The PNMR refers to the number of perinatal deaths per 1, 000 total bihs. It is usually repoed on an annual basis. It is a major marker to assess the quality of health care delivery.",

Thus, it is ecological study. Here I am giving simple example to understand data utilization at population level and at individual level: i) In studies with individuals as unit of study, it is necessary to know the exposure and disease status of all individuals. For example in a case-control study, we take the history of risk factor exposure from every individual whether he/she is of case group or of control group. ii) In ecological study (with population as the unit of study), exposure and disease are not studied at individual level. For example in this, question, data on disease is collected from the government and data on fat consumption is collected from food industry.

Spurious association o Observed association between a disease and suspected factor is spurious, i. e., not real. o In other words there is an observed association when none actually exists. Indirect association o The indirect association is a statistical association between a variable of interest and a disease due to the presence of another factor, known or unknown, that is common to both the variable and the disease. o This third factor (i. e., the common factor) is also known as the confounding variable. o For example, endemic goitre (disease) is found at high altitudes (variable), showing thereby an association between altitude and endemic goitre. But it is due to iodine deficiency which is common at high altitude. So, iodine deficiency acts as a confounding factor as it is associated with both high altitude and endemic goitre. Direct (causal) association a) One to one causal relationship Two variables are stated to be causally related if change in one is followed by change in other.

These will be used to measure the progress made under the stop TB strategy. It focuses onthe five principal indicators that are used to measure the implementation and impact of TB control. They are: case detection, treatment success, incidence, prevalence and deaths. The global targets for case detection and treatment success have been set by WHO's World Health Assembly. By 2015: The global burden of TB (prevalence and death rates) will be reduced by 50% relative to 1990 levels. This means reducing prevalence to 150 per 100, 000 or lower and deaths to 15 per 100, 000 per year or lower by 2015 (including TB cases coinfected with HIV).

International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of WHO, acknowledged dioxins cancer causing potential and classified it as human carcinogen. o To avoid dioxin production, no chlorinated plastic bags (and preferably no other chlorinated corn pounds) should be introduced into the incinerator. Red bags must not be incinerated as red colour contains cadmium, which causes toxic emissions. If mercury-containing items are put into a red bag for infectious waste and sent to an incinerator or other waste treatment technology, mercury will contaminate the environment. o Airborne mercury then enters a global distribution cycle in the environment, contaminating fish and wildlife. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cross the blood- brain barrier as well as the placenta. Public concerns about incinerator emissions, as well as the creation of federal regulations for medical waste incinerators, are causing many health care facilities to rethink their choices in medical waste treatment. As stated by Health Care Without Harm, an international coalition of47() organizations in 52 countries, non-incineration treatment technologies are a growing and developing field. Some technologies are still essentially prototypes, while others, such as autoclave technology, have been used for decades.",

Deaths at this age are due to a peculiar set of diseases and conditions to which the adult population is less exposed or less vulnerable.

In India, epidemic dropsy occurs as a food adulterant disease where use of mustard oil as cooking medium is common. When mustard oil is adulterated deliberately (as in most cases) or accidental contamination with argemone oil, proteinuria (specifically loss of albumin) occurs, with a resultant edema as would occur in nephrotic syndrome. Other symptoms are bilaterall pitting edema of extremities headache, nausea, loose bowels, erythema and breathlessness. In severe cases fatalities are repoed due to congestive heart failure. The toxic effects of argemone oil have been attributed to the presence of benzophenanthridine alkaloids, sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine. it has been repoed that the sanguinarine alkaloid content in argemone oil varies from 0. 44% to 0. 50%. Sanguinarine and Dihydrosanguinarine alkaloids, present in argemone oil are the responsible etiological agents of Epidemic dropsy. Though, epidemic dropsy is known in the country for the past hundred years still there are no established effective lines of treatment.",

        "exp": "Phase 2 blockade produced succinylcholine [Ref: Morgan's Anaesthesia 4/e p 112; Miller's Anaesthesia 6/e p 9851 Patients developing paralysis after prolonged and high dose of succinyl choline is highly suggestive of phase II succinyl choline block. Phase II block with succinylcholine occurs with prolonged and high dose of the drug. -(High dose for Sch is 7-10 mg/kg, 30-60 minutes of exposure is considered prolong). Morgan's Anaesthesia 4thie p. 112 The type of succinylcholine block may change into a non depolarizing block following prolonged administration of the drug (phase II block). Transition from a depolarizing to phase 11 block is gradual and usually occurs after administration of 7-10 mg/kg of succinylcholine. Recovery from a phase II block is much slower. Millers Anaesthesia 6thie p. 985 After administration of 7-10 mg/kg or 30-60 minutes of exposure to succinylcholine, nondepolarizing dual or phase II block occurs Prolonged paralysis with succinylcholine administration may also occur in pseudocholinesterase deficiency - But in pseudocholinesterase deficiency prolonged paralysis occurs with usual dose of succinylcholine. Succinylcholine is a noncompetitive muscle relaxant Normally muscles contract due to the action of acetylcholine released in the neuromuscular synaptic junctions Acetylcholine acts by activating its receptors present on motor end plate, and generates action potential Competitive Neuromuscular blockers act by blocking the action of acetylcholine and prevents the generation of action potential. On the other hand succinylcholine acts by depolarization of the motor end plate i. e. it activates the acetylcholine receptor present at the motor end plate. - At their,, first application voluntary muscle contracts but as they are not destroyed immediately like acetylcholine the depolarization persist. It might be expected that this prolonged depolarisation would cause muscles to remain contracted but this is not so. - With prolonged administration, a depolarization block changes to competitive block. Succinykholine produces neuromuscular block by overstimulation so that the end plate is unable to respond to fuher stimulation. Neuromuscular block with succinykholine occurs in two sequential phases An initial depolarization of the endplate produces muscle action potentials and. fasciculations. Maintained depolarization past the threshold for. firing produces Na+ channel inactivation so that muscle action potentials cannot be generated. This is called phase I or depolarization block In the continued presence of succinylcholine, the membrane becomes repolarized. Na+ channel inactivation is reversed and muscle membrane excitability is restored Nonetheless, the neuromuscular block persists because of desensitization of Acetylcholine receptors This is known as phase II or desensitization block -The mechanism for phase 11 block is not completely understood, a series of allosteric transitions in Acetylcholine receptor is suspected. Succinylcholine phase I block changes to phase II block after prolonged administration of the drug usually following 7-10 mg/kg of the drug or 700 nzg drug. Pseudocholinesterase deficiency Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine which is pharmacologically inactive. In ceain conditions metabolism of succinylcholine to the metabolically inactive succinylmonocholine cannot occur. These are:? Genetic determined inability to metabolize succinylcholine -Small propoion of patients have genetically determined inability to metabolize succinylcholine. -1n these patients either the plasma cholinesterase is absent or there is an abnormal fornz of the enzyme present. - The metabolism of sucinylcholine is reduced and the patient have prolonged paralysis. - An impoant point to note is that this prolonged paralysis occurs even with usual doses of succinylcholine. Other endogenous and exogenous causes Plasma cholinesterase activity can be reduced by a number of endogenous and exogenous causes such as: -- Pregnancy - Liver disease - Uremia - Malnutrition - Burns - Plasma pheresis - Oral contraceptives These conditions usually lead to a slight clinically unimpoant increase in the duration of action of succinylcholine.",

So, when disease occurs in expected frequency in the absence of epidemic --> Endemic disease. o When conditions are ourable for disease agent, it may occur in excess of expected occurrence, i. e., endemic disease bursts into epidemic. o If normal expectancy is zero, even one case is considered epidemics. That means occurence of new disease in a community is an epidemic. Similarly reoccurrence of an eradicated/eliminated disease is an epidemic. Statistically speaking, epidemic is said to occur when number of cases exceed 'twice the standard detion' Some times term outbreak is used. for a small, usually localized epidemic. o Diseases causing epidemics are measles, chickenpox, and cholera. o Besides these there is modern slow epidemic of non-communicable diseases like CHD. Pandemic o An epidemic usually affecting a large propoion of population over a large geographic area such as a nation, e. g., influenza, Cholera El Tor and acute hemorrhagic conjuctivitis. Ecdemic o Disease that originates outside the geographic area in which it occurs. Sporadic o The cases occur irregularly, haphazardly from time to time, and generally infrequently. o The cases are so few and separated widely in space and time that they show little or no connection with each other, nor a recognizable common source of infection. o Examples - Polio, Tetanus, meningococcal meningitis, Herpes Zoster.

It is the chance of frequency of occurrence of a characteristic relative to its non-occurrence, i. e., it is the ratio of occurrence. Odds Vs probability The probability is a propoion, i. e., it is the number of times a given outcome occurs divided by all the occurrences. If we take a sample of blood from a patient five times, and the sample is positive one time, then the probability is 1 in 5 or 0. 20. On the other hand, the odds is a ratio, i. e., it is the number of times a given outcome occurs divided by the number of times that specific outcome does not occur. With same blood sample example, the odds of a positive sample is = No. of positive slide/No of negative slide = 1/4. Example If the probability of occurence of a cancer is 0. 25 (25%). In otherword the nonoccurence of cancer will be = 1 - 0. 25 = 0. 75 (75%).",

It was first developed by Maurice Hilleman in the late 1960s The vaccine is a mixture of three live attenuated viruses. The MMR vaccine is administered by a subcutaneous injection. In the case of live vaccines, immunization is generally achieved with a single dose. The exception is polio vaccine which needs three or more doses. As per Indian Academy of Paediatrics, the vaccine is administered once to children around the age of 15 months. Few countries advocates a second dose also before staing of school (i. e. age 4/5). The second dose is not a booster; it is a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2-5%) who fail to develop measles immunity after the first dose. An inactivated vaccine (or killed vaccine) consists of virus paicles which are grown in culture and then killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde Types include: - Viral: polio vaccine (Salk vaccine) and influenza vaccine - Bacterial: typhoid vaccine, cholera vaccine, plague vaccine, and peussis vaccine Examples of live attenuated vaccines include: - Viral: polio vaccine (Sabin vaccine), measles vaccine, mumps vaccine, rubella vaccine, chicken pox vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, and nasal-spray flu vaccine. - Bacterial: BCG vaccine, typhoid vaccine A toxoid is a bacterial toxin (usually an exotoxin) whose toxicity has been weakened or suppressed either by chemical (formalin) or heat treatment, while other propeies, typically immunogenicity, are maintained. Toxoids are used in vaccines as they induce an immune response to the original toxin or increase the response to another antigen.

        "question": "A person found some correlation between dietary factors and a disease; he did this by collecting data from the food manufacturers and hospitals respectively, such a study is?",
        "exp": "Ecological study. Observational studies allow nature to take its own course; the investigator measures but does not intervene. Descriptive studies are those that investigate the distribution of disease in a population Analytical studies analyse the relationship between the disease and the causative factors. Experimental or interventional studies involve an active attempt to change a disease determinant or the progress of a disease (similar in design to experiments in other sciences) Descriptive studies Descriptive studies are usually the first phase of an epidemiological investigation. These studies are concerned with observing the distribution of disease or health-related characteristics in human population and identify the characteristics with which the disease in question seems to be associated. These studies provide clues to disease etiology and help in formulation of an etiological hypothesis. Case repo - the simplest of the descriptive studies is the case repo, which is often seen in medical journals and describes an unusual feature or unusual association between the disease and some exposure factor. Case series - a case series is a sequence of case repos with common elements such as similar clinical features and suspected common exposures. They can be valuable early evidence for association between exposures and diseases which can be studied in more detail subsequently; however as they lack a control (comparison) group, the case series can result in false leads, wasted energy & resources. Cross-sectional or Prevalence study - in cross-sectional studies, we 'survey' several individuals at one point in time and collect information on health status, health-related behaviours, and other exposure factors. In this way we can estimate the burden of disease in a group of individuals and try to estimate whether a paicular exposure is linked to a disease or health outcome. Ecological or correlational study - an ecological or correlational study is one in which the unit of analysis is an aggregate of individuals and information is collected on this group rather than on individual members. The association between a summary measure of disease and a summary measure of exposure is studied. E. g., There is a positive correlation between fat consumption and breast cancer across many nations. Conclusion: Fat consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer. An error of reasoning (Ecological Fallacy) occurs when conclusions are drawn about individuals from data that are associated with groups, as relationships observed for groups may not necessarily hold for individuals. In the above example, it is not possible to infer that the women with breast cancer actually had a high fat consumption. Analytical studies Analytical studies are the second major type of epidemiological studies. In contrast to descriptive studies that look at the entire population, in analytical studies the subject of interest is the individual within the population. The object is not to formulate, but to test hypotheses. Case Control - Sometimes it is necessary to study individuals in whom a disease has already occurred in order to find out whether these individuals had been exposed to a paicular risk factor. This is called a case control study. The cases are compared to a group of individuals who do not have the disease in question and the same information on risk factors is collected from both groups. By doing this, we may be able to find out if a paicular risk factor is more common among the cases than controls and therefore suggest an association between the risk factor and disease. Coho study - In a coho study, a group exposed to a paicular factor and another group not exposed to this factor are followed up over time to determine occurrence of disease. The incidence of disease in the exposed group is compared to the incidence of disease in the unexposed group. This is called the relative risk and it allows us to make a judgment on whether the exposure factor and the disease are causally linked.",

It is most commonly correlated with prolonged alcohol, amphetamine or methylphenidate consumption resulting in thiamine deficiency.

Motivation determines both individual action and individual behaviour. It can be both negative as well as positive. Both motives and incentives have a social role in the community.

For example, the average height for adult men in USA is about 70 inches, and standard deviation is 3 inches. Then - If dispersion of mean is 1 SD -> most men (about 68%) have a height within 3 inches of the mean (67-73) inches. If dispersion of mean is 2 SD -> almost all men (95%) have a height within 6 inches of the mean (64 - 76) inches. If dispersion is zero SD all men would be exactly 70 inches. That means greater the standard deviation greater will be the data spread away from standard deviation. Coming back to question Here all newborn babies has 2. 8 kgs of weight.

        "question": "Minimum duration of developing coal miner pneumoconiosis: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. D: More than 10 years Simple pneumoconiosis (first phase of anthracosis) requires 12 years of exposure Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP)/ Black lung disease It is caused by long exposure to coal dust. It is a common affliction of coal miners and others who work with coal, similar to both silicosis from inhaling silica dust, and to the long-term effects of tobacco smoking. Inhaled coal dust progressively builds up in the lungs and is unable to be removed by the body; that leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and in worse cases, necrosis. Coal workers' pneumoconiosis, severe state, develops after the initial, milder form of the disease known as anthracosis (anthrac - coal, carbon). This is often asymptomatic and is found to at least some extent in all urban dwellers due to air pollution. Prolonged exposure to large amounts of coal dust can result in more serious forms of the disease, simple coal workers' pneumoconiosis and complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis (or Progressive massive fibrosis, or PMF). More commonly, workers exposed to coal dust develop industrial bronchitis, clinically defined as chronic bronchitis (i. e. productive cough for 3 months per year for at least 2 years) associated with workplace dust exposure. Coal dust is not as fibrogenic as is silica dust. Coal dust that enters the lungs can neither be destroyed nor removed by the body. The paicles are engulfed by resident alveolar or interstitial macrophages and remain in the lungs, residing in the connective tissue or pulmonary lymph nodes. Coal dust provides a sufficient stimulus for the macrophage to release various products, including enzymes, cytokines, oxygen radicals, and fibroblast growth factors, which are impoant in the inflammation and fibrosis of CWP. Aggregations of carbon-laden macrophages can be visualised under a microscope as granular, black areas. In serious cases, the lung may grossly appear black. These aggregations can cause inflammation and fibrosis, as well as the formation of nodular lesions within the lungs. Simple CWP is marked by the presence of 1-2mm nodular aggregations of anthracotic macrophages, suppoed by a fine collagen network, within the lungs. Those 1-2mm in diameter are known as coal macules, with larger aggregations known as coal nodules. These structures occur most frequently around the initial site of coal dust accumulation - the upper regions of the lungs around respiratory bronchioles. The coal macule is the basic pathological feature of CWP, and has a surrounding area of enlargement of the airspace, known as focal emphysema. Continued exposure to coal dust following the development of simple CWP may progress to complicated CWP with progressive massive fibrosis (PMF), wherein large masses of dense fibrosis develop, usually in the upper lung zones, measuring greater than 1 cm in diameter, with accompanying decreased lung function. These cases generally require a number of years to develop. Grossly, the lung itself appears blackened. Pathologically, these consist of fibrosis with haphazardly-arranged collagen and many pigment-laden macrophages and abundant free pigment. Radiographically, CWP can appear strikingly similar to silicosis. In simple CWP, small rounded nodules predominate, tending to first appear in the upper lung zones. The nodules may coalesce and form large opacities (>1 cm), characterizing complicated CWP, or PMF There are three basic criteria for the diagnosis of CWP: - Chest radiography consistent with CWP - An exposure history to coal dust (typically underground coal mining) of sufficient amount and latency - Exclusion of alternative diagnoses (mimics of CWP) Symptoms and pulmonary function testing relate to the degree of respiratory impairment, but are not pa of the diagnostic criteria. Chest X-ray appearance for CWP can be viually indistinguishable from silicosis. Chest CT, paicularly high-resolution scanning (HRCT), are more sensitive than plain X-ray for detecting the small round opacities.",
