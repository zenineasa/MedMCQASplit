Is also known as 'Study of genomes of organisms'. Genome: Is sum total of genetic information of an individual, encoded in structure of DNA. Genetics: Is the science which investigates roles and functions of a single gene. Gene therapy : Introduction of a gene sequence into a cell with an aim to modify the cell's behavior. Gene cloning: To isolate a DNA sequence and then produce its multiple copies. Genetic engineering: Human manipulation of genetic material by recombinant techniques.",
