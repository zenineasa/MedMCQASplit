        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e. Negatively skewed Relationship among the three measures of central tendency (ie mean, median and mode) in a skewed curve is an oft repeated question. Lets first see what skewed distribution curve is.* An asymmetrical distribution curve can be of two types: Positive skewed distribution curve. Negative skewed distribution curve. Positive (or right) and negative (or left) skewed curves are recognized by the location of the tail of the curve (not by the location of the hump - a common error). Positive or Right skewed distribution curve * there curves have a relatively large number of low scores and a small no of very high scores the mean lies towards the extreme right of the curve Negative or left skewed distribution curve. there curves have a large number of high scores and a relatively small number of low scores the mean lies towards the extreme left of the curve. Now lets see the measures of central tendency. Modeis the most frequently occurring valueit lies at the peak of the hump. Meanis the arithmetic averageit is greatly influenced by the relatively small number of very high or very low scoresit liestowards the extreme right in a right (Positive) distribution curve andtowards the extreme left in a left (negative) distribution curve. Medianis the middle valueit lies b/w the mean and mode dividing the curve into two equal halves. Relationship b/w the measures of central tendency* In a symmetrical curve. Mean = Median = Mode* In a Positive (Right) skewed curve. Mean > Median > Mode* In a Negative (left) skewed curve. Mean < Median < Mode",

Now data is arranged in ascending order -71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 95o Here, 79 is the middle observation that is separating the upper four values from lower four values, so it is the median. o If there are two values in the middle instead of one, the median is worked out by taking the average of the two middle values. o For example, If diastolic BP of 10 individuals is as follows83, 75, 81, 79, 71, 95, 75, 77, 84, 90. Data is arranged in ascending order -71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 90, 95o Here two values are separating the upper half of values from lower half. So the median here is -Median =79 + 812= 80.

Here mean =50. 3median = 7o The value of mean has affected seriously, whereas median is not affected, and median is more nearer to the truth. o So, median is used when the distribution of values is skewed (deviated) with some small number of very high values - median is used for skewed distribution.",

Mean: It is calculated by summing all the observations and then dividing by number of observations. It is generally denoted by. x. It is calculated as follows. Mean (x) = Sum of the values of all observations (Sx) / Total number of observations (n). Mathematicallyx = Sx / n. It is influenced by extreme values. Median: Median is a locative measure which is the middlemost observation after all the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. In other words median is that -value which divides the entire data set into 2 equal parts, when the data set is ordered in an ascending (or descending) fashion. In case when there is odd number of observations we have a single most middle value which is the median value. In case when even number of observations is present there are two middle values and the median is calculated by taking the mean of these two middle observations. Thus! Median ={ n +1 /2: when n is odd}Unlike mean, median is not influenced by extreme values. Mode: Mode is the most common value that repeats itself in the data set. Though mode is easy to calculate, at times it may he impossible to calculate mode if we do not have any value repeating itself in the data set. In this case mean is 3. 3, median 2. 5 and mode is 2.

Coefficient of variation (CV). Coefficient of variation (CV) is a normalized measure of dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution. It is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. The absolute value of the CV is sometimes known as relative standard deviation (RSD). which is expressed as a percentage. Advantages. Disadvantages* The coefficient of variation is useful because the standard deviation of data must always be understood in the context of the mean of the data.* In contrast, the actual value of the CV is independent of the unit in which the measurement has been taken, so it is a dimensionless number.* For comparison between data sets with different units or widely different means, one should use the coefficient of variation instead of the standard deviationQ.* When the mean value is close to zero, the coefficient of variation will approach infinity and is therefore sensitive to small changes in the mean. This is often the case if the values do not originate from a ratio scale.* Unlike the standard deviation, it cannot be used directly to construct confidence intervals for the mean.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' ie Mean is less than the median Relationship among the three measures of central tendency (ie mean, median and mode) in a skewed curve is an oft repeated question. Let's first see what skewed distribution curve is. An asymmetrical distribution curve can be of two types: Positive skewed distribution curve. Negative skewed distribution curve. Positive (or right) and negative (or left) skewed curves are recognized by the location of the tail of the curve (not by the location of the hump - a common error). Positive or Right skewed distribution curve. These curves have a relatively large number of low scores and a small no of very high scores. The mean lies towards the extreme right of the curve. Negative or left skewed distribution curve. These curves have a large number of high scores and a relatively small number of low scores the mean lies towards the extreme left of the curve. Now let's see the measures of central tendency. Mode is the most frequently occurring value it lies at the peak of the hump. Mean is the arithmetic average it is greatly influenced by the relatively small number of very high or very low scores it liestowards the extreme right in a right (Positive) distribution curve andtowards the extreme left in a left (negative) distribution curve. Median is the middle value it lies b/w the mean and mode dividing the curve into two equal halves. Relationship b/w the measures of central tendency* In a symmetrical curve. Mean = Median = Mode* In a Positive (Right) skewed curve. Mean > Median > Mode* In a Negative (left) skewed curve. Mean < Median < Mode",
