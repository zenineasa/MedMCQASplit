A homogeneous mass is formed, and cubes (e. g. of 1 m) or pellets are produced onsite, subsequently, these can be transported to a suitable storage site. Alternatively the homogeneous mixture can be transported in liquid state to a landfill and poured onto the surface of previously landfilled municipal waste, then covered with fresh municipal waste.* The following are typical proportions (by weight for the mixture):# 65% pharmaceutical waste# 5% lime# 15% cement# 5% water",

Yellow tags-- (observation) for those who require observation (and possible later re-triage). Their condition is stable for the moment and, they are not in immediate danger of death. These victims will still need hospital care and would be treated immediately under normal circumstances. Green tags - (wait) are reserved for the \"walking wounded\" who will need medical care at some point, after more critical injuries have been treated. White tags - (dismiss) are given to those with minor injuries for whom a doctor's care is not required. Black tags - (expectant) are used for the deceased and for those whose injuries are so extensive that they will not be able to survive given the care that is available. Another reference: style=\"font-size: 1. 04761904761905em; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif; margin: 0 0 0 8px; text-indent: 0\">Four (4) tabs are colour coded for expedient identification of priority: 1.

Delayed (YELLOW): Those for whom treatment and transportation can be delayed while more seriously injured persons receive care. 3. Minor (GREEN): Those patients who can ambulate to an alternative location without assistance. 4. Dead/Dying (BLACK): Those patients who do not resume spontaneous breathing after positioning of the head and insertion of an OPA, and have no spontaneous pulse.

A \"hazard''can be defined as any phenomenon that has the potential to cause disruption or damage to people and their environment. DISASTER MANAGEMENTThere are three fundamental aspects of disaster management: -# Disaster response, # Disaster preparedness, # Disaster mitigation. Response# Response after disaster.# Include rescue, first aid, triage etc.# Note that triage is the only approach that can provide max benefit to the greatest no. of injured in major disaster situations. Red indicates high priority Rx or transfer, yellow signals medium priority, green indicates ambulatory patients and black for dead or moribund patients. Preparedness# Objective to ensure that appropriate systems, procedures and resources are in place to provide prompt effective assistance to disaster victims. Mitigation# Measures to prevent hazards or lessen likely effect of emergencies.",

        "question": "Fibreoptic scopes are sterilized by",
        "exp": "Ans. a (Glutaraldehyde). (Ananthnarayan, Microbioloyg, 4th ed., 32). Sterilisation. Sterilisation by steam (Autoclave). Sterilisation by hot air. Sterilisation by ethylene oxide. Sterilization by low-temperature steam and formal dehyde. Sterilisation by irradiation- Vegetative bacteria, including tuberculosis, and viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV and heat-resistant spores, including C. tetani and C. perfringens, are killed.- Combination of pressure, temperature and time with the moist heat is important: 134degC (30 lb/in. 2) for a hold time of 3 minutes; 121degC (15 lb/in. 2) for a hold time of 15 minutes;- Monitoring=Steam penetration/Bowie - Dick test and chemical indicators, for example Brownes tubes or impregnated tapes, are used to ensure that errors. Biological indicators are not appropriate.- Inefficient compared with moist steam sterilisation, but it has ability to treat solid non- aqueous liquids grease/ ointments and to process closed (airtight) containers.- Lack of corrosion may be important, particularly with instruments with fine cutting edges such as ophthalmic instruments.- It cannot be used for substances such as rubber, plastics and IV fluids which are denatured.- ETO is highly penetrative non- corrosive broad- spectrum cidal gas.- It is utilised for heat-sensitive -materials including electrical equipment.- It is not recommended for ventilator respiratory equipment or soiled instruments because organic debris, including serum, has a marked adverse effect. This uses a combination of dried saturated steam and formaldehyde, with the main advantage being that sterilisation is achieved at a low temperature (73degC) and the method is so suitable for heat-sensitive materials and items of equipment with integral plastic components.- It is not recommended for sealed, oily items or those with retained air.- Some plastics and fabrics absorb formal-dehyde, releasing this in a delayed manner which may cause hypersensitivity to the users.- This employs gamma rays or accelerated electrons.- It is an industrial process and is appropriate to the sterilisation of large batches of similar products, such as syringes, catheters and IV cannulas.- Irradiation dose in excess of 25 k. Gy is accepted as providing adequate sterility assurance. Disinfection. Disinfection with low-temperature steam:- Typical conditions include exposure to dry saturated steam at a temperature of 73degC for a period of 20 minutes at a pressure below atmospheric. Useful for dealing with dirty returns from OT/clinics which may be contaminated with bodily secretions and microorganisms. Following this instruments must be cleaned. Disinfection with boiling water:- Uses soft water at 100()C at normal pressure for 5min. Instruments must be thoroughly cleaned before utilised. Disinfection with formaldehyde:- Formaldehyde gas is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent. This process utilises a cabinet which is airtight and circulates gaseous formaldehyde up to 50degC. Disinfection with glutaraldehyde: A 2 % solution of glutaraldehyde is effective against most bacteria, viruses, including hepatitis B and C and HIV, and is a high-level disinfection particularly useful for the decontamination of flexible endoscopes.",
