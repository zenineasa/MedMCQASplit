The ultimate goal of communication is to bring about a change in desired direction of person who receives communication.# This may be cognitive level in terms of increasing knowledge.# It may be affective in terms of change in behaviour and attitude.# It may be psychomotor in terms of acquiring new skills.# Types of learning:- Cognitive learning (Knowledge) e.g. Enumerating causes of obesity- Affective learning (Attitude) e.g. Motivating a person for blood donation- Psychomotor learning (skills) e.g. Measuring pulse rate; Arriving at differential diagnosis.ATTITUDEAn attitude has been defined as a relatively enduring organization of beliefs around an object, subject, or concept which predisposes one to respond in some preferential manner. Attitudes are acquired characteristics of an individual. They are more or less permanent ways of behaving. An attitude includes 3 components - (a), a cognitive or knowledge element (b). an affective or feeling element, and (c). a tendency to action. It has been truly said that attitudes are caught, and not taught. Once formed, attitudes are difficult to change. Social psychology is largely a study of attitudes.LEARNINGis any relative permanent change in behaviour that occurs as a result of practice or experience. It means acquiring something new - new knowledge, new tech, new skills, new fears, and new experiences. It is both conscious and unconscious.HABITSis an accustomed way of doing things. Habits are said to have 3 characteristics - (a), they are acquired through repetition (b). they are automatic (c). they can be performed only under similar circumstances.",
