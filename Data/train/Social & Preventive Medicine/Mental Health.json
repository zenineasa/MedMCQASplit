        "question": "Which is NOT used in treatment of heroin dependence?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Disulfiram o Heroin is diamorphine and is 3 times more potent than morphine. Treatment of morphine or heroin poisoningo Treatment can be divided into:-A. Treatment of toxicity (overdose)# Overdose is a medical emergency, and is treated with opioid antagonist to reverse the complications (respiratory depression) by antagonizing the action on opioid receptors. Intravenous naloxone is the antagonist of choince for morphine (heroin) poisoning. Oral naltrexone is used for maintenance therapy, once acute poisoning has been treated by iv naloxone. Intravenous nalmefene is another specific antagonist. B. Treatment of dependence# Treatment of dependence include medically supervised withdrawal and detoxification, followed by maintenance therapy. a) Detoxificationo Detoxification process include abrupt withdrawal of opioid followed by management of the emergent withdrawal symptoms, i. e., treatment of withdrawal syndrome. Detoxification can be done by any of the following. 1. Substitution of long-acting opioid agonism:- Methadone is the treatment of choice. Because of its agonistic activity on opioid receptors it suppresses withdrawal symptoms. L-alpha-acetyl-methadol/ Levomethyl (LAAM) is the other opioid agonist which was used for this purpose. However it is no longer in use because some patients developed prolonged QT intervals (torsades de points). 2. Substitution of partial agonist:- Buprenorphine can be used in place of methadone because of its partial agonistic activity on opioid receptor. 3. Substitution by a2 agonists:- Clonidine acts as a sympatholytic agent due to its agonistic action on central presynaptic a2 receptors which reduce nor-adrenergic activity. Therefore, clonidine reduces the adrenergic withdrawal symptoms. Lofexidine another a2 agonist, is an alternative to clonidine. 4. Clonidine plus naltrexone:- A more rapid detoxification can occur when clonidine is used along with naltrexone. Naltrexone, when given in opioid dependent patient, causes withdrawal symptoms because of its antagonistic action. These can be treated with clonidine. The addition of short acting Benzodiazepine (lorazepam or oxazepam) and NSAIDs, will help relieve withdrawl symptoms not covered by clonidine. It should be kept in mind that naltrexone should not be used alone for detoxification (to treat withdrawl syptoms) as it precipitates or worsens the withdrawl syndrome. 5. Other drugs:- Dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylateb) M aintenance therapyo Once detoxification phase is over (i. e., withdrawal symptoms have been managed), the patient is maintained on any of the following drugs to prevent relapse by reducing craving and preventing 'kick' or 'euphoria' produced by opioids (morphine or heroin). Drugs used are:-1. Methadone:- Reduces craving and 'kick/euphoria' from morphine or heroin because their opioid receptors are already occupied. 2. LAAM and buprenorphine:- Similarly reduce craving. 3. Opioid antagonists (naltrexone):- Naltrexone can be used orally to assist in the rehabilitation of exopioid abusers who are fully withdrawn (otherwise it induces an acute withdrawl syndrome). Naltrexone prevents relapse by discouraging substance seeking behavior - If a patient, who is on naltrexone maintenance therapy, takes an opioid, there is no 'kick' or 'euphoria' as opioid receptors are already blocked. Naltrexone can be used with clonidine as in detoxification.",

The compulsion (checking) may involve multiple trips back into the house to check the stove or door. 3) Intrusive thoughts (Pure obsessions):- In this third most common pattern, there are intrusive obsessional thoughts without a compulsion. Such obsessions are usually repetitious thoughts of a sexual or aggressive act that is reprehensible to the patient. 4) Symmetry:- This is the fourth most common pattern in which there is obsession for symmetry or precision, which can lead to compulsion of slowness.

        "question": "Alcoholic says that he drinks to overcome family problem - defense mechanism -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. Rationalization o Logical and socially acceptable explanation for an unacceptable behavior or feeling is rationalization Important Defence mechanisms1) Denial: - Denial is the avoidance of awareness of some painful aspect of reality by negating sensory data. Person is unable to face reality or admit an obvious truth (i. e., He is in denial). Denial is an outright refusal to admit or recognize that something has occured or is currently occuring. For example, denying that the physicians's diagnosis of cancer is correct and seeking a second opinion. 2) Repression and suppression:- Repression acts unconsciously to exclude anxiety provoking ideas or feelings from conscious awareness. For example, a person who has repressed memories of abuse suffered as a child. When this is done consciously by forcing the unwanted information out of our awareness, it is referred as suppression, i. e., pushing the unwanted feelings into unconscious. For example, trying to forget something that causes anxiety. Suppression is the only voluntary defence mechanism. o Unconscious exclusion of anxiety provoking feelings from awareness - Repressiono Conscious exclusion of anxiety provoking feelings from awareness - Suppressiono Repression is the most basic defence mechanism therefore it is also referred as primary defence. 3) Displacement:- Unconscious shifting of impulses on a less threatening target. For example, rather than express our anger in way's that could lead to negative consequences (like arguing with our boss), we instead express our anger towards a person or object that poses no threat (such as our spouse, children or pets). 4) Sublimation:- Acting out unacceptabe impulses in a socially acceptable way. For example, sublimating your aggressive impulses toward a carrier as a boxer, or becoming a surgeon because of your desire to cut or lifting weight to release 'pent up' energy. 5) Projection:- Placing unacceptable impulses in ourself onto someone else. In very simple language, Projection is placing blame for the unwanted event upon other. For example, would be saying that you failed in exam because the teacher is racist. 6) Intellectualization:- Excessive use of intellectual processes (logic) to avoid affective expression (emotion), i. e., avoiding unacceptable emotions by focusing on the intellectual aspects. For example, a person who has just been diagnosed with a terminal illness might focus on learning everything about the disease in order to avoid distress and remain distant from the reality of the situation. 7) Rationalization:- It is a defense mechanism that involves offering a socially acceptable behavior or feeling. For example, a student might blame a poor exam score on the instructor rather than his/her lack of preparation. 8) Regression:- The personality may suffer a loss of some of the development already attained and may revert to a lower level of adaptation and expression. When confronted by stressful events, people sometimes abandon coping strategies and revert to patterns of behaviour used earlier in development. For example, sitting in a comer and crying after hearing bad news or throwing temper tantrum when you dont get your way or a teenager sucking their thumb around exam time. 9) Reaction formation:- Transforming an unacceptable impulse into opposite extreme. For, example, a married woman who is disturbed by feeling attracted to one of her huband's friends treats him rudely. 10. Active out:-The individuals copes with stress by engaging in actions rather then reflecting upon internal feeling. 11. Altruism:- Satisfying internal needs through helping others. 12. Undoing:- An act or communication which partially negates a previous one. For example, two close friends have a violent argument; when they next meet one of them brings the other a small gift. 13. Passive-aggresstion:-Indirectly expressing anger towards other. These people have a tendency of expressing their anger or frustration in a silent way, instead of expressing it directly. For example, a reluctant child forced to bring sugar from shop spills it on the way. 14. Aim inhibition:- The individual accepts a modified form of their original goal. For example, becomming a high school basketball coach rather than a professional athelete. 15. Anticipation:- Realistic thinking and planning about future's unpleasurable events. 16. Humor:- The individual deals with unacceptable impulses using humor in a manner which does not produce unpleasantness in self or others, e. g., pointing out the funny or ironic aspect of situation.",
