B: Hepatitis B Hepatitis B vaccine is a killed 'inactivated' vaccine Hepatitis B vaccine The vaccine contains one of the viral envelope proteins, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs. Ag). It is produced by yeast cells, into which the genetic code for HBs. Ag has been inseed. A course of three (3) vaccine injections are given with the second injection at least one month after the first dose and the third injection given six months after the first dose. The first vaccine became available in 1981. Presently recombinant DNA vaccines are available, which means they are produced by inseing the gene for HBV into common baker's yeast where it is grown, harvested, and purified. It is now believed that the hepatitis B vaccine provides indefinite protection. However, it was previously believed and suggested that the vaccination would only provide effective cover of between five and seven years, but subsequently it has been appreciated that long-term immunity derives from immunological memory which outlasts the loss of antibody levels and hence subsequent testing and administration of booster doses is not required in successfully vaccinated immunocompetent individuals. Hence with the passage of time and longer experience, protection has been shown for at least 25 years in those who showed an adequate initial response to the primary course of vaccinations, and guidelines now suggest that for initial responders who require ongoing protection, such as for healthcare workers, only a single booster is advocated at 5 years.",

Ecological concept According to this concept, health is a dynamic equilibrium between man and his environment, and disease a maladjustment of human to environment. According to Dubos \"health implies the relative absence ofpain and discomfo and a continuous adaptation and adjustment to the environment to ensure optimal function\". The ecological concept raises two issues, i. e. imperfect man and imperfect environment. 3. Psychological concept it includes the influence of social, psychological, cultural, economic and political factors. 4. Holistic concept The holistic model is a synthesis of all the above concepts. This view corresponds to the view held by the ancients that \"health implies a sound mind, in a sound body, in a sound family, in sound environment. \" The holistic approach implies that all sectors of society have an effect on health, in paicular, agriculture, animal husbandry, food, industry, education, housing, public works and communication.

So, \"The presence of spores of Cl. perfringens in a natural water suggest that fecal contamination has. occured and their presence, in the absence of the coliform group suggests that. fecal contamination occured at some remote time\" -Park 20/e, p 630 Rest of the three options are true, as explained below Bacteriological quality of drinking water (WHO guidelines) Organism Guideline value All water intended for drinking. - E. coli or thermotolerant coliform bacteria * Must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample. * Treated water entering the distribution system - E. coli or thermotolerant coliform bacteria - Total coliform bacteria. - Must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample - Must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample. In case of large supplies, where sufficient samples are examined, must not be present in 95% of sample taken throughout any 12- month period. Note - Although E. coli is the more precise indicator of faecal pollution, the count of thermotolerant coliform bacteria is an acceptable alternative. If necessary, proper confirmatory test must be carried out. Total coliform bacteria are not acceptable indicators of the sanitary quality of rural water supplies, paicularly in tropical areas where many bacteria of no sanitary significance occur in almost all untreated supplies. So it is evident that colifonns should not be detectable in any 100 ml sample except for 5% of samples of large supplies taken over 12-month period. Surveillance of drinking water quality Sanitary survey - On-the-spot inspection and evaluation of the entire water supply system. Sampling - Collection of water samples has to be done with through aseptic precaution and according to guidelines. Bacteriological surveillance - A complete bacteriological examination consists of - (1) Presumptive coliform test (a) Multiple tube method - Estimation of the most probable number (MPN) of coliform organisms in 100 ml of water Confirmatory tests: In chlorinated water, presence of coliform organism is to be confirmed by Eijkman's test: Subculturing each presumptive positive tube in 2 tubes of brillian green bile broth. One tube is incubated at 37degC x 48 hrs to confirm coliform organism Other tube is incubated at 44degC x 6-24 hrs to confirm E. coli which produces gas from lactose at 44degC. - Fuher confirmation of E. coli can be obtained by testing for indole production at 44degC. (b) Membrane filtration technique (2) The detection of faecal streptococci and Cl. perfringens in doubtful cases of faecal pollutionof water. (3) Colony count - provides an estimate of the general bacterial purity of water. Counts from the same source at frequent intervals may be of considerable value in comparison to single count. A sudden increase in the colony count may give the earliest indication of contamination. Biological examination - The microscopic organisms such as algae, fungi, yeast, protozoa, rotifers, crustaceans, minute worms etc. are called as 'plankton'. They are an index of pollution of water. Chemical surveillance: Basic tests include test for pH, color, turbidity, chlorides, ammonia, chlorine demand and residual chlorine. Complete analysis will include analysis for toxic metals, pesticides, persistent organic chemical and radioactivity too. Sodium thiosulphate an antidote of cynanide poisoning is also used in water purification: - For dechlorination to reduce chlorinous taste after superchlorination of highly polluted waters, swimming pool or spas - To dechlorinate tap water for aquarium or treat effluent from waste water treatment prior to release into rivers.",

There are no presenting symptoms. Recognition is only by virus isolation or rising antibody titres. ABOIVE POLIO: Occurs in approximately 4 to 8%. lt causes only a mild or self-limiting illness due to viraemia. The patient recovers quickly. Recognition is only by virus isolation or rising antibody titre. NON-PARALYTIC POLIO: Occurs in approximately 1% of all infections with presenting features of stiffness and pain in the neck and back. The disease lasts 2 to 10 days. Recovery is rapid. PARALYTIC POLIO: Occurs in less than 1 % infections. The virus invades CNS and causes varying degrees of paralysis. REMEMBER: India repoed its last polio case on January 13, 2011 in West Bengal. In 2009, it repoed 741 polio cases, more than anywhere else in the world.

Measurements of malaria in the pre eradication era Spleen rate: Defined as the percentage of children between 2 & 10 years of age showing enlargement of spleen. Spleen rate is widely used for measuring the endemicity of malaria in a community. Av. enlarged spleen: A refinement of spleen rate, denoting the average size of spleen.

Therefore, it involves the joint efforts of the whole social fabric (the individual, the community, and the state) to protect and promote health. 1. Individual responsibility (Self Care) Health has to be earned and maintained by the individuals by 'Self Care', a recent trend in health care. Self care refers to those activities individuals undertake in promoting their own health, preventing their own disease, limiting their own illness, and restoring their own health. For example, measuring self BP, doing exercise, taking nutritious diet etc. 2. Community responsibility (Community participation) Health can never be adequately protected by health services without active understanding and involvement of the communities whose health is at stake. This makes community participation a very important aspect of health care. Therefore, emphasis has shifted from health care for the people to health care by the people. 3. State responsibility Responsibility for health does not end with the individual and community effort. The state assumes responsibility for the health and welfare of its citizen State shall make proper state health policy. 4.

B: Denominator is mid-year population Case fatality rate= Total number of deaths due to a disease X 100/ Total number of cases due to that disease Case fatality/Fatality rate: It is the ratio of deaths within a designated population of people with a paicular condition, over a ceain period of time. An example of a fatality rate would be 9 deaths per 10, 000 people at risk per year. This means that within a given year, out of 10, 000 people formally diagnosed with a disease, 9 died. Rabies, if contracted by an unvaccinated individual who does not seek prophylactic treatment, is also an extremely deadly virus, with a case fatality rate approaching 100%. Moality rate: It is a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit time. Moality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1000 individuals per year; thus, a moality rate of 9. 5 in a population of 100, 000 would mean 950 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0. 95% out of the total. It is distinct from morbidity rate, which refers to the number of individuals in poor health during a given time period (the prevalence rate) or the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time (incidence rate). The term \"moality\" is also sometimes inappropriately used to refer to the number of deaths among a set of diagnosed hospital cases for a disease or injury, rather than for the general population of a country or ethnic group. This disease moality statistic is more precisely referred to as \"case fatality\". One Distinguishes: The crude death rate, the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people. The perinatal moality rate, the sum of neonatal deaths and fetal deaths (stillbihs) per 1000 bihs. The maternal moality ratio, the number of maternal deaths per 100, 000 live bihs in same time period. The maternal moality rate, the number of maternal deaths per 1, 000 women of reproductive age in the population (generally defined as 15-44 years of age). The infant moality rate, the number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1000 live bihs. The child moality rate, the number of deaths of children less than 5 years old per 1000 live bihs. The standardized moality rate (SMR)- This represents a propoional comparison to the numbers of deaths that would have been expected if the population had been of a standard composition in terms of age, gender, etc. The age specific moality rate (ASMR) - This refers to the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people of a given age.",

So, the test in question cannot be considered as screening test. The test in question will result in increase in the apparent 5 years survival rate. But this is a potential bias: For example, consider a disease in which 50% of people die 5 year after the diagnosis by usual diagnostic test Now a new test is used which diagnoses the disease 1 year earlier then usual diagnostic test. So all these 50% patient will be surviving 5 years after the diagnosis because the time period after the onset of disease and death is same, but the disease is diagnosed one year earlier. Incidence will remain the same as the number of new cases diagnosed are the same. Period Prevalence of disease will increase as the duration of clinical disease will increase as the disease is diagnosed 1 year earlier, so duration will become 6 years instead of 5 years.

However Lippincott Biochemistry 3/e p360 mentions that corn oil contains little amount of n-3 fatty acids. According to Park 19/e p482, table 2, both Groundnut oil and Corn oil are rich in n-6 fatty acid (Linoleic acid). n-3 fatty acids (popularly referred to as co-3 fatty acids or omega-3 fatty acids) are long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, with the first double bond beginning at the third carbon atom (when counting form the methyl end of the fatty acid molecule). Impoant nutritionally essential n-3 fatty acids are: - a-linolenic acid (ALA), - eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and - docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). n-6 fatty acids are long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, with the first double bond beginning at the sixth carbon atom eg. Linoleic acid, the most impoant essential fatty acid. Both the n-3 a-linolenic acid and n-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty, acids which must be obtained from food. Park mentions that an ideal fat for good health is one which maintains a balance so as to give a ratio of PUFA/saturated fatty acids of 0. 8-1. 0 and linoleic/alpha-linolenic (n-6/n3) of 5-10 in the total diet. Park gives a list of food rich in alpha linolenic acid (n-3 fatty acid): wheat, bajra, blackgram, iobia, rajmah soyabean, green leafy vegetables, fenugreek (methi) mustard and fish. Flaxseed oil is one of the best sources of the essential fatty acids. It contains approximately 50-60% of the omega-3 essential fatty acid (alpha-linolenic acid), and roughly 18-20% of the omega-6 essential fatty acid (linoleic acid). Flaxseed oil is nature's richest source of linolenic acid (n-3 fatty acid).",

It is a zoonotic disease i. e infecting mainly animals and accidentally man. The disease is transmitted to man by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Man is an incidental 'dead-end' host. Man to man transmission has not so far been recorded. Available evidences indicates that the basic cycles of transmission are: a). Pig -4 Mosquito Pig b). Ardeid bird --> Mosquito --> Ardeid Bird Culex mosquitoes are its main vectors. C. tritaeniorhynchus has been implicated as the most impoant vector in South India. It breeds in the rice paddy fields, shallow ditches and pools. These mosquitoes are zoophilic, feeding primarily on veebrate hosts. Not all individuals bitten by infected mosquitoes develop disease. The ratio of ove disease to inapparent infection varies from 1: 300 to 1: 1000. Thus cases of encephalitis represent only the tip of the iceberg compared to the large no. of inapparent infections. Case fatality rate varies between 20-40% Other relevant impoant facts Pigs are the major veebrate hosts of JE* Infected pigs do not manifest any ove symptoms of illness but circulate the virus. Pigs are considered as amplifiers of the virus Cattle and buffaloes may also be infected with the JE virus; although they may not be natural hosts of JE virus, they act as mosquito attractants. Among domestic animals, horses are only known so far to show signs of encephalitis due to JE virus*. Vaccination Vaccination of the population at risk is recommended. Currently there are three types of JE vaccines in large-scale use: a. The mouse brain-derived inactivated vaccine b. The cell culture-derived inactivated vaccine c. The cell culture-derived live attenuated vaccine based on SA 14-14-2 strain of the JE virus Immunization schedule: The mouse brain-derived inactivated vaccine - When immunizing children 1-3 years of age 2 primary doses of vaccine are given 4 weeks apa. Boosters are given after 1 yr and then subsequently at 3 years interval, until the age of 10-15 yrs. This schedule provides protection throughout childhood. - The vaccine is best used in the inter-epidemic period. The cell culture-derived live attenuated vaccine - Only a single dose of vaccine is needed, followed by a single booster after 1 yr. - This vaccine is an integral pa of Universal Immunization programme in 11 endemic districts of UP, Assain, West Bengal and Karnataka. Vaccination of travellers: - For travellers aged more than one year, visiting rural areas of endemic countries, vaccination is required. - The schedule is of 3 primary doses at days 0, 7 and 28 (alternative schedule is of 2 primary doses 4 weeks apa). - If continued protection is required, boosters can be given after 1 yr and then after every 3 years. Vaccination is not recommended for children before the age of 6 months as infants are likely protected by maternal antibodies. Also Know",

The cold chain The cold chain is a system of storage and transpo of vaccines at low temperature from the manufacturer to the actual vaccination site. o The cold chain system is necessary because vaccine failure may occur due to failure to store and transpo under strict temperature control. In cold chain following equipments are used:? a) Walk in cold rooms (WIC) Located at state/regional (4-5 districts) level. Can store vaccine upto 3 months. Usual temprature is + 2 to +8degC. Also contains walk in freezers (WIF) which has temprature - 20 to - 40degC b) Large deep freezers (DF) & Large ice -lined refrigerators (ILR) Located at all districts. Can store vaccines upto 1 month. Temprature of large ice-lined refrigerator is +2 to +8degC and is used to store vaccines (other than OPV & measles). Temprature of large deep freeze is -20degC to - 40degC and is used for making ice packs and to store OPV and measles. c) Small DF & Small ILRs Provided at PHC level Function & temprature are same as in large DF (for small DF) and large ILR (for small ILR). Can store vaccines upto 1 month. d) Cold boxes, vaccine carriers and day carriers Provided at subcentres. Are used for transpoation of vaccines. A vaccine carrier contains 16-20 ls and a day carrier contains 6-8 ls of vaccines. Full frozen ice packs are used in these carriers (a vaccine carrier contains 4 full frozen ice packs and a day carrier contains 2 fully frozen ice packs). Maintain the temprature at +2 to +8degC. Can store vaccine upto 48-72 hours. e) Dial thermameter For temprature monitoring of ILR (twice daily) Now see the question o This peripheral worker has returned one day late (24 hours). He must be carrying any of the carrier device mentioned above (e. g., ice box). He can put the vaccine in ice box which can store vaccine upto 48-72 hours and next morning vaccines can be transferred to ILR for storage. Following information has been added in 22nd/e of Park o Deep freezer maintain temperature between -15degC to -25degC (previously it was -20deg C to -40degC). At PHC deep freezers are used only for making Ice packs and are not used for storing any of the universal immunization programme (UIP) vaccines (previously it was also used to store OPV and measles). o ICE - lined refrigerator (ILR) is used to store all UIP vaccines (previously it was not used to store OPV and measles vaccine). All vacines must be kept in the basket of ILR along with diluents. Arrange the vaccines in order (from top to bottom) hepatitis B, DP & TT, BCG, measles, OPV. Discard any frozen hepatitis B, DPT and TT. Measles and OPV can be kept over two rows of empty icepacks on the floor of ILR.",

The priorties of countries persuing measles control include:- Improve routine vaccination coverage level to at least 90%. Active coverage of more than 90% in catch-up and follow-up campaigns or active coverage of more than 90% with routine second dose of measles vaccine. Establish case - based surveillance with laboratory confirmation of suspected cases and virus isolation from all chains of transmission. Conduct supplementary vaccination campaign together with administration of vitamin 'A' in high risk areas. In India, measles is a major cause of morbidity and a significant contributor to childhood mortality. Prior to the immunization programme, cyclical increase in the incidence of measles were recorded every third year. With the increase in immunization coverage levels, the intervals between cyclic peaks has increased and the intensity of the peak minimized.

        "question": "For a survey a village is divided into 5 lanes then each lane is sampled randomly is an example is?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Stratified random sampling Simple random sampling has been explained (See above explanation). Systematic random sampling In order to do systematic random sampling, the individuals in a population are arranged in a ceain way (for example, alphabetically). o A random staing point is selected and then every nth (for example 10th or 15th) individual is selected for the sample. o That is, after arranging the individuals in ceain pattern (e. g., alpabetically) a staing point is chosen at random, and choices thereafter at regular intervals. For example, suppose you want to sample 8 houses from a street of 120 houses. 120/8 = 15, So every 15th house is chosen after a random staing point between 1 and 15. If the random staing point is 11, then the houses selected are -4 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 101, and 116. o In contrast to simple random sampling, some houses have a larger selection probabily e. g., in this question 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 100 and 116. While the remaining number can not be selected. Stratified random sampling When sub-populations vary considerably, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently. o Stratification is the process of grouping members of the population into relative hemogenous subgroups before sampling. o The strata should be mutually exclusive, every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. o Then systematic random sampling method is applied within each stratum. Population Stratification -4 Systematic random sampling -4 Sample. o This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error. o For example, suppose in a population of 1000, sample of 100 is to be drawn for Hb estimation, first conve the population into homogenous striata (e. g., 700 males and 300 females), then draw 70 males and 30 females by doing systematic random sampling. Now see the question o First the village has been stratified into five lanes. o Then random sampling is done on each lane. o It is stratified random sampling. Multistage random sampling: o Is done in successive stages; each successive sampling unit is nested in the previous sampling unit o Advantage: Introduces flexibility in sampling. o For example, in large country surveys, states are chosen, then districts, then villages, then every 10th person in village as final sampling unit. Multiphase random sampling: Is done in successive phase; pa of information is obtained from whole sample and pa from the sub-sample. o For example, in a TB survey, Mantourx test done in first phase, then X-ray done in all Mantoux positive, then sputum examined in all those with positive X-ary findings.",

But after reading following text you will not have any confusion. Option 'c' o As I have explained in previous explanation sample size depends upon underlying expected event rate in the control group. o The underlying expected event rate is established usually from previous studies, including observational coho study. So, the expected event rate will depends on the hypothesis made by previous study e. g., Coho study. o As the expected event rate is one of the component to calculate sample size, previously made hypothesis will determine the sample size (see above explanation). Option `d' Many subjects under study do not come for follow up, i. e., they dropout. This may cause misleading aifacts. o To avoid this intention to treat trial (intention to treat analysis) approch is utilized. \"Intention to treat\" is a strategy for the analysis of randomized control trials that compares patients in the groups to which they were originally randomly assigned. o Everyone who begins the treatment is considered to be a pa of the trial, whether they finish or not (dropouts not excluded).

( thiamine should always be replenished when refeeding a patient with alcoholism, as carbohydrate repletion without adequate thiamine can precipitate acute thiamine deficiency.) o Beriberi has been repoed among refugees who are relying on emergency food aids.

B: 150 mg/L Softening of the water is recommended at level of hardness of more than 150 mg/ liter of calcium carbonate (>3 meq/ liter) Hardness in water It is defined as concentration of multivalent cations. Multivalent cations are cations (positively charged metal complexes) with a charge greater than 1+. They mainly have the charge of 2+. These cations include Ca2+ and Mg2+. Common calcium-containing minerals are calcite and gypsum. A common magnesium mineral is dolomite (which also contains calcium). The following equilibrium reaction describes the dissolving/formation of calcium carbonate scales: Ca. CO3 + CO2 + H20 Ca2+ + 2. HCO3- The total water hardness, including both Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, is repoed in pas per million (ppm) or mass/volume (mg/L) of calcium carbonate (Ca. CO3) in the water. Although water hardness usually measures only the total concentrations of calcium and magnesium (the two most prevalent divalent metal ions), iron, aluminium, and manganese can also be present at elevated levels in some locations. The presence of iron characteristically confers a brownish (rust-like) colour to the calcification, instead of white (the color of most of the other compounds). Classification and level of hardness in meq/1 Soft water: Less than 1 (< 50 mg/1) Moderately hard: 1-3 (50-15 mg/1) Hard water: 3-6 (150-300 mg/1) Very hard water: Over 6 (> 300 mg/1) Water softening is the reduction of the concentration of calcium, magnesium, and ceain other metal cations in hard water. These \"hardness ions\" can cause a variety of undesired effects including interfering with the action of soaps, the build up of limescale, which can foul plumbing, and galvanic corrosion. Conventional water-softening appliances intended for household use depend on an ion-exchange resin in which hardness ions are exchanged for sodium ions. Water softening may be desirable where the source of water is hard (when the hardness exceeds 3 meq/1 or 150 mg/1).",

Measurements of malaria in the pre eradication era a) Spleen rate: Defined as the percentage of children between 2 & 10 years of age showing enlargement of spleen. Spleen rate is widely used for measuring the endemicity of malaria in a community. b) Av. enlarged spleen: A refinement of spleen rate, denoting the average size of spleen. c) Parasite rate: Defined as on the percentage of children between the ages of 2 & 10 yrs showing malarial parsites in their blood films. d) Parasite density index: Average degree of parasitimia e) Infant parasite rate Percentage of infants showing malarial parasites in their blood films. It is the most sensitive index of recent transmission of malaria in a locality. If the infant parasite rate is zero for three consecutive years in a locality, it is regarded as absence of malaria transmission even though, the Anopheline vectors responsible for previous transmissions may remain.

This column is easy to form, you do it by successively accumulating the relative frequencies of each of the various intervals. In the above table the cumulative percentage for the first three intervals is 8. 8 + 33. 3 + 17. 5 = 59. 6 and we can say that 59. 6% of the children in the data set have a weight of 39. 5 lb or less. Or, as another example, 96. 4% of children weight 69. 5 lb or less. The cumulative relative frequency can be presented graphically. This type of curve is called a cumulative frequency graph or OGIVE. To construct such a graph, we place a point representing the cumulative relative frequency and the points are connected with straight lines. The cumulative frequency graph provides a class of impoant statistics known as percentiles or percentile scores. For example, the 90th percentile is the numerical value that exceeds 90% of the values in the data set and is exceeded by only 10% of them. As another example, the 80th percentile is that numerical value that exceeds 80% of the values contained in the data set and is exceeded by 20% of them, and so on. The 50th percentile is commonly called the median. Uses of Cumulative frequency graph When two cumulative frequency graph, representing two different data sets, are placed on the same graph, they provide a rapid visual comparison without any need to compare individual intervals. Cumulative frequency graph provides an impoant application in the formation of health norms for the monitoring of physical process (weight and height) of infants and children.",

        "exp": "Ans. C: Less time consuming Longitudinal studies are difficult to organize and more time consuming Longitudinal study It is a correlational research study that involves repeated observations of the same variables over long periods of time -- often many decades. It is a type of observational study. Longitudinal studies are often used in psychology to study developmental trends across the life span, and in sociology to study life events throughout lifetimes or generations. The reason for this is that unlike cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies track the same people, and therefore the differences observed in those people are less likely to be the result of cultural differences across generations. Because of this benefit, longitudinal studies make observing changes more accurate and they are applied in various other fields. The design is used to uncover predictors of ceain diseases. Because most longitudinal studies are observational, in the sense that they observe the state of the world without manipulating it, it has been argued that they may have less power to detect causal relationships than do experiments. But because of the repeated observation at the individual level, they have more power than cross-sectional observational studies, by viue of being able to exclude time-invariant unobserved individual differences, and by viue of observing the temporal order of events. Types of longitudinal studies include coho studies and panel studies. Coho studies sample a coho, defined as a group experiencing some event (typically bih) in a selected time period and studying them at intervals through time. Panel studies sample a cross-section, and survey it at (usually regular) intervals. A retrospective study is a longitudinal study that looks back in time. For instance a researcher may look up the medical records of previous years to look for a trend.",

An Intrauterine Contraceptive Devices is usually made up of polypropylene impregnated with barium sulphate, for visualizing them on X-rays. The commonly used devices are \"T\" shaped with a horizontal and a veical arm. The veical arm has a copper wire wrapped around it and two colored threads at the lower end. These nylon threads (tail) which protrudes through the cervix into the vagina, allows to check IUCD whether in place or not. The frequently used IUD's is Copper T 200 (Cu T-200) which is available free through government and municipal hospital based programs the effective life span is a minimum of 3 years.

Primordial prevention Primary prevention Secondary prevention Teiary prevention Primordial Level of Prevention: Is primary prevention (see below) in purest sense o It is the prevention of the emergence or development of risk factors in countries or population groups in which they have not yet appeared o Modes of Intervention: 1) Individual Education 2) Mass Education o Primordial Level is Best level of prevention for Non-communicable diseases Primary Level of Prevention: o It is the action taken prior to onset of disease, which removes the possibility that a disease will ever occur o Modes of Intervention: 1) Health Promotion: Is targeted at strengthening the host through a variety of approaches/ interventions, e. g. Health Education, Environmental modifications, Nutritional interventions, Lifestyle & behavioural changes 2) Specific Protection: Is targeting the prevention of disease through a specific intervention o Primary level of prevention is applied when 'risk factors are present but disease has not yet taken place' o It signifies 'intervention in the Pre pathogenesis Phase of a disease/ health problem' Secondary Level of Prevention: o It halts the progress of disease at its' incipient stage and prevents complications Modes of Intervention: 1) Early Diagnosis: Detection of disturbances while biochemical, functional and morphological changes are still reversible or prior to occurrence of manifest signs & symptoms 2) Treatment: Shoens period of communicability, reduces moality and prevents occurrence of fuher cases (secondary cases) or any long term disability o Secondary level of prevention is applied when disease has possibly set in: It attempts to arrest the disease process, seek unrecognized disease & treat it before irreversibility and reverse communicability of infectious diseases o National Health Programmes by Govt. of India mostly operate at Secondary level of prevention o Secondary prevention is an imperfect tool in control of transmission of disease: It is more expensive and less effective than primary prevention It is an impoant level of prevention for diseases like Tuberculosis, Leprosy and STDs Teiary Level of Prevention: Is applied when disease has advanced beyond early stages: It aims to reduce or limit impairments & disabilities, minimize suffering caused by existing depaures from good health o Modes of Intervention: 1) Disability Limitation: It 'prevents the transition of disease from impairment to handicap' 2) Rehabilitation: Training & retraining of an individual to the highest possible level of functional ability; It can be medical, vocational, social or psychological o Teiary level of prevention signifies 'intervention in late pathogenesis phase'",

All cases of severe measles and all cases of measles in areas with high case-fatality rates should be treated with vitamin A, as many children develop an acute deficiency of vitamin A, which may lead to keratomalacia and blindness from corneal scarring. So, vitamin 'A' should be administered along with the measles vaccine. A high dose of vitamin A is given immediately on diagnosis of measles and repeated the next day. The recommended age-specific daily doses are 50, 000 IU for infants aged < 6 months, 100, 000 IU for infants aged 6-11 months, and 200, 000 IU for children aged 12 months.

Note? o Now you have read about both correlation and regression. Here I am explaining the difference between two in brief. o While correlation indicates the degree (strength) of association between two variables, regression does quantification of this relationship i. e. regression indicates the nature of the relationship Algebraically. o For example, Height to weight is an association:- i) Strength of this association will be determined by correlation ---> strong positive / negative or weak positive / negative. ii) Quantification is done by regression --> by regression we might predicts the weight by measuring height.",
