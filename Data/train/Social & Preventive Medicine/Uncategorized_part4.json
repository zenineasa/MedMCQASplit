Correlation quantifies how well the two variables X and Y are related together, but one can not predict one unit change of one variable will cause how much change of the other variable. For this regression equation is needed. o If two variables are highly correlated, it then becomes possible to predict the value of the dependent variable from the value of the independent variable by using regression teachnique. Regression analysis is the mathematical modelling to describe the effect that one or more independent variables have on a dependent variable. o So, when there is distinct relation between two variables, one has to perform both the calculations, i. e. correlation coefficient followed by regression. If no relationship is established in correlation coefficient, regression is not required at all. Types of Regression There are following types of regression:? 1. Linear Regression In Linear Regression the influence of independent (explanatory) variable on a dependent (response) variable is linear, i. e. change in the independent variable will cause a change in the dependent variable that can be depicted by a straight line. Linear regression may be of two types: i) Simple linear regression: - Expresses the effect of one independent (X) variable on dependent variable (Y)- y = a + bx where? a = is a constant Ida intercept constant b is the regression coefficient x is the independent variable. y = is the dependent variable whose value is to be found out. ii) Multiple linear regression:- Expresses the effect of more than one independent variables on a dependent variable. 2. Curvilinear regression In some situations, the influence of independent variable on the dependent variable is like a curve (instead of straight line). The suffix 'linear' is still there because the curve can be conveed to line after some mathematical transformation such as logarithm and square. Curvilinear regression, similar to linear regression, may be of two types: i) Simple curvilinear regression:- influence of one independent variable on a dependent variable, with some power on independent variable y = a + b(x)6 ii) Multiple Curvilinear regression: Influence of more than one independent variables on a dependent variable, with some power on independent variables. y = a + b (x, )2 + C(X2)3 + d(x3)3 3. Non-linear regression Third type of regression is called non-linear regression which has curve like relationship. However; this term is used only for the relationship that cannot be conveed to linear form by any transformation. Coming to the Question o In the regression equation there is no square or logarithm. That means it is linear regression. o There is only one independent variable (x). o Therefore, this is simple linear regression which can be depicted by a straight line.",

These agents are typically found in nature, but it is possible that they could be changed to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicine, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, through water, or in food. Terrorists may use biological agents because they can be extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Some bioterrorism agents, like the smallpox virus, can be spread from person to person and some, like anthrax, can not. Bioterrorism Agent Categories Bioterrorism agents can be separated into three categories, depending on how easily they can be spread and the severity of illness or death they cause. Category A agents are considered the highest risk and Category C agents are those that are considered emerging threats for disease. Category A These high-priority agents include organisms or toxins that pose the highest risk to the public and national security because: They can be easily spread or transmitted from person to person They result in high death rates and have the potential for major public health impact. They might cause public panic and social disruption They require special action for public health preparedness. Category B These agetns are the second highest priority because They are moderately easy to spread They result in moderate illness rates and low death rates They require specific enhancements of CDC's laboratory capacity and enhanced disease monitoring. Category C These third highest priority agents include emerging pathogens that could be engineered for mass spread in the future because: They are easily available They are easily produced and spread They have potential for high morbidity and moality rates and major health impact.",

D: Asbestosis Mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer of the pleura and peritoneum, has been shown to have a strong association with the crocidolite variety of asbestos Mesothelioma/Malignant mesothelioma It is a rare form of cancer that develops from the mesothelium. It is usually caused by exposure to asbestos. Its most common site is the pleura, but it may also occur in the peritoneum, the pericardium, or the tunica vaginalis. Most people who develop mesothelioma have worked on jobs where they inhaled asbestos, or they have been exposed to asbestos dust and fiber in other ways. It has also been suggested that washing the clothes of a family member who worked with asbestos can put a person at risk for developing mesothelioma. Unlike lung cancer, there is no association between mesothelioma and smoking, but smoking greatly increases the risk of other asbestos-induced cancers. The symptoms of mesothelioma include shoness of breath due to pleural effusion or chest wall pain, and general symptoms such as weight loss. The diagnosis may be suspected with chest X-ray and CT scan, and is confirmed with a biopsy and microscopic examination. A thoracoscopy can be used to take biopsies. It allows the introduction of substances such as talc to obliterate the pleural space (pleurodesis), which prevents more fluid from accumulating and pressing on the lung. Despite treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy or sometimes surgery, the disease carries a poor prognosis. Indeed, the relationship between asbestos and mesothelioma is so strong that many consider mesothelioma a \"signal\" or \"sentinel\" tumor. In rare cases, mesothelioma has also been associated with irradiation, intrapleural thorium dioxide (Thorotrast), and inhalation of other fibrous silicates, such as erionite. Screening tests might diagnose mesothelioma earlier than conventional methods thus improving the survival prospects for patients. The serum osteopontin level might be useful in screening asbestos-exposed people for mesothelioma. The level of soluble mesothelin-related protein is elevated in the serum of about 75% of patients at diagnosis and it has been suggested that it may be useful for screening.",

        "question": "A group tested for a drug shows 60% improvement as against a standard group showing 40% improvement. The best test to test the significance of result is -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Chi-square test Chi square test o Is used when the observation are in the form of propoions (for qualitative data) o The outcome are in clear cut answers; yes or no. As in the example the HBs. Ag is either present or not present. In contrast when the observation is normally distributed in the population e. g blood pressure, blood sugar; student test is used. o In the example comparing the occurence of hepatitis B surface antigen in medical and dental students, use of chi square analysis is appropriate because the outcome variables are dichomatous. Students are classified by the presence or absence of HBs. Ag. Student t test o is used when the outcome variable is normally distributed in population (for quantitative data) e. g blood pressure, blood glucose. In the example student t test is used to assess the difference between mean systolic pressure of pregnant and non pregnant women ( to know the effect of pregnancy on mean systolic blood pressure) because mean systolic blood pressure is normally distributed in the population. Every single lady has a mean systolic blood pressure. It may be low or high, but she has a value of mean systolic blood pressure. Students t test may be following types: i) Unpaired t test (Independent t test): It compares the mean of two small samples: The data is unpaired from two independent sample. for example, blood sugar concentration is measured in two different group (A group of 10 patients and other group of 8 patient). To test the significance of difference between the means of the two groups, unpaired t test is used. ii) Paired t test: It compares the mean in paired data, before and after the intervention from same sample. For example, Blood sugar level in a sample of 10 patients is measure before giving and after giving the oral hypoglycemic. In this condition paired t test is used. Chi-square test Vs Student t test In the example student t test is used to assess the difference between mean systolic pressure of pregnant and non pregnant women ( to know the effect of pregnancy on mean systolic blood pressure) because mean systolic blood pressure is normally distributed in the population. Every single lady has a mean systolic blood pressure. It may be low or high, but she has a value of mean systolic blood pressure. o But suppose we change the example in a way that we make a clear cut definition of hypertension ( such as mean systolic blood pressure over 140 mm of Hg will be taken to be hypertension) and then look for hypertension among pregnant and non-pregnant women. o The test now used to analyse the outcome will be chi square test since the outcomes are now in the form of dichomatous data i. e yes or no (a woman is either hypeensive or not hypeensive. This is in contrast to mean systolic blood pressure which was normally distributed among ladies; every lady had one value of mean systolic blood pressure). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (F test/ F ratio) o ANOVA is considered as an extension of the student t test for the significance of the difference between two sample means. The student t test can be used only for making just one comparison (between two sample means), or between a sample mean and hypothesized population mean. ANOVA is used when more than one comparison is to be made (When means of more than two groups are being compared). o For example, BP is measured in more than two groups of men (married, unmarried, widowed, separated and divorced). In this situation ANOVA test is best. Fisher's test (Fisher's exact test) o It is same as Chi square test; the difference being in sample size which is small for Fishers' t test; (i) When sample size is big, chi square test is used. (ii) When sample size is small fisher test is used. The chi-square test is acceptable when all the expected cell values are greater than 1 and no more the 20% of cells have expected value below 5. Otherwise fisher's exact test is recommended. o For example, a study is under taken to determine whether smoking is associated with chronic bronchitis and the observed frequencies are:- Chronic bronchitis No bronchitis Smoking 6 4 10 No Smoking 2 7 9 8 11 l9 o Now we will figure the expected frequencies:- There are all together 8 chronic bronchitis patients among 19 person examined (a propoion of 8/19); and 11 persons out of 19 have no chronic bronchitis (a propoion of 11/19). The expected frequency will be:- Expected frequency of chronic bronchitis in smokers = Total number of smokers (10) x propoion of persons having chronic bronchitis (8/19) = 4. 2 Expect frequency of smokers not developing bronchitis = Total number of smokers (10) x propoion of person not developing bronchitis (11/19) = 5. 7. Expected frequency of chronic bronchitis in nonsmokers = Total number of non-smokers (9) x propoion of persons having bronchitis (8/19) = 3. 7 Expected frequency of nonsmoker not developing branchitis = total number of non-smoker (9) x propoion of person not developing brachitic (11/19) = 5. 2. Chronic Bronchitis No Bronchitis Smoking 10 (8/19)= 4. 2 10 (11/19)=5. 7 No Smoking 9 (8/19)= 3. 7 9 (11/19) = 5. 2 Because, 50% of cells (2 out of 4) have an expected frequency less then 5, fisher exact test should be used not chi-square test. Z-test o Z-test is a variant of student t test. It involves the same steps as t-test and can be used when the sample is large enough (n > 100) for the standard detion to provide a reliable estimate of standard error. Mc Nemar test: It is used for paired dichomatous data i. e. it is similar to paired t test, the difference being that paired t test is used for variable which is normally distributed in population such as mean systolic B. P., Serum sodium Concentration where as Mc Nemar test is used when the data are in dichomatous form (i. e. yes & no -either the person is hypeensive or non hypeensive, either he is diseased or not diseased). Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test (mann-whitiney 'II' test) o It is non parametric equalent of the unpaired t tests. Similar to unpaired t test it is used when data is unpaired from two independent sample. However, it is used for qualitative data (as all non-parametric tests) ---> compares the percentage, fractions and propoions in two unpaired samples. Wilcoxon Signed - Rank Test o It is nonparametric equalent ofpaired t test. It is used when data (qualitative) is paired (before and after intervention) from the same group --> compares the percentage, fractions and propoions in two paired samples. Sign-test Sign test is also non-parametric equalent to paired t test and is very much like wilcoxon signed ranked test. However, instead of determining the ranks of the absolute difference we just keep track of the number of positive or negative differences. o That means, both wilcoxon signed ranked test and sign test compare percentage, propoions and fractions in pair data. However, Wilcoxon signed rank test determines the ranks of the absolute differences and sign test keeps track the number of positive and/or negative differences.",

A typical Primary Health Center covers a population of 20, 000 in hilly, tribal, or difficult areas and 30, 000 populations in plain areas with 4-6 indoor/observation beds. It acts as a referral unit for 6 sub-centers and refer out cases to CHC (30 bedded hospital) and higher order public hospitals located at sub-district and district level. Objectives of Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) for Primary Health Centers: The overall objective of IPHS is to provide health care that is quality oriented and sensitive to the needs of the community. The objectives of IPHS for PHCs are: - To provide comprehensive primary health care to the community through the Primary Health Centers. - To achieve and maintain an acceptable standard of quality of care. - To make the services more responsive and sensitive to the needs of the community. Minimum Requirements (Assured Services) at the Primary Health Center for meeting the IPHS: Assured services cover all the essential elements of preventive, promotive, curative and rehabilitative primary health care. This implies a wide range of services that include: Medical care: Maternal and Child Health Care including family planning Medical Termination of Pregnancies using Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) technique.

        "exp": "Ans. B: Coagulation Pathway Severe maternal zinc deficiency has been associated with congenital malformations or spontaneous aboions Zinc deficiency has been repoed to result in sexual infantilism (zinc is required for proper reproduction) Zinc is required for wound healing. Zinc enhances cell growth and division. Zinc Zinc is found in nearly 100 specific enzymes, serves as structural ions in transcription factors and is stored and transferred in metallothioneins. It is \"typically the second most abundant transition metal in organisms\" after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. In proteins, Zn ions are often coordinated to the amino acid side chains of aspaic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine and histidine. There are 2-4 grams of zinc distributed throughout the human body. Most zinc is in the brain, muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest concentrations in the prostate and pas of the eye. Semen is paicularly rich in zinc, which is a key factor in prostate gland function and reproductive organ growth. In humans, zinc plays \"ubiquitous biological roles\". It interacts with \"a wide range of organic ligands\", and has roles in the metabolism of RNA and DNA, signal transduction, and gene expression. It also regulates apoptosis. In the brain, zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons and can \"modulate brain excitability\". It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and so in learning. However it has been called \"the brain's dark horse\" since it also can be a neurotoxin, suggesting zinc homeostasis plays a critical role in normal functioning of the brain and central nervous system. Zinc is an efficient Lewis acid, making it a useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions. The metal also has a flexible coordination geometry, which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions. Two examples of zinc-containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase, which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Interviewer bias Information (Observer or misclassification bias) o Information bias is a type of connitive bias o Are when propoion of subjects misclassified on exposure or disease. o Information bias occurs due to people's curiosity and confusion of goals when trying to choose a course of action. o It may be of following types i) Repoing bias Individual with severe disease tends to have complete records therefore more complete information about exposures and greater association found. ii) Recall bias (memory bias) Those who have disease (cases) have a greater sensitivity for recalling exposure than those who dont have disease (controls). iii) Interviewer bias Caused by the action of the interviewer, e. g., Interviewer generally devote more time to cases as compared to controls. iv) Hawthorne bias (Attention bias) It is caused by change in behavior of human subjects of an experiment, simply becasue they know that they are being observed. For example, if we want to study the smoking as a risk factor for lung carcinoma and we take 2 groups (50 smokers and 50 nonsmoker) and follow them for 10 years. It may be possible that over the time study subjects may change their behavior, e. g. 5 out of 50 smokers quit smoking behavior. This will cause Hawthorne bias. It is quite obvious that Hawthorne effect will occur in prospective studies (where the study subject are being observed), e. g. in Coho Study. This bias will not occur in retrospective study as the study subjects are not observed rather their history is taken. Coming back to question o Interviewer bias occurs because the investigator knows beforehand, the paicular procedure or therapy to which the patient has been subjected. o This prior information may lead him to focus more on the group which he knows, is more susceptible. o In the question the physician already knows that children without BCG scar (nonimmunized) children are more prone to develop Tuberculosis than patients with BCG scar (immunized) children. o This prior information will lead him to investigate children without BCG scar more thoroughly as he knows, that being unimmunized these children are more prone to develop T. B. o On the other hand while investigating children with BCG scar, the interviewer will be bit careless as he knows that these children are already immunized. o This will automatically lead to detection of more cases of T.

Even if one of the test is negative the pt. is considered negative for diseases. Thus as quite apparent 'serial testing' increases specificity but decreases the sensitivity. Parallel testing In parallel testing multiple diognostic tests are given concurrently and the pt is considered positive for disease if any of the tests give positive result. For exmaple ECG and Echocardiography are two procedures used in the diagnosis of VSD. When used in Parallel mode the pt. will be considered to have VSD, if any of the test give positive result (even if the other test gives negative result) For example Suppose 10 different diagnostic tests are used to diagnose a paicular disease If test are used in Series mode The pt. will be declared positive only when all the tests give positive result. Even if 9 tests give positive and one in negative pt. will be considered negative. Because even a single positive test is considered positive True positivity increases - Sensitivity increases.

Chemoprophylaxis is indicated only for close contacts. Sulfonamides, once widely employed in chemoprophylaxis, should no longer be used for that purpose because approximately 25% of meningococcal isolates are now resistant to sulfonamide.

Indirect contact: It involves body surface contact with a contaminated intermediate object. As hand contact is the most common mode of transmission, the best preventive measure of nosocomial infection is proper hand hygiene. 2) Droplet transmission It occurs when droplet containing microorganisms from an infected person are propelled through the air (e. g. coughing, sneezing) and land on the mouth, eyes or nose of another person. 3) Airborne transmission It results when a droplet containing microorganisms evaporates and remains suspended in air for a long time (this should not be confused with droplet infection, in which transmission is immediate and droplets do not remains suspended in the air). Airborne transmission also occurs by dust paicles containing microorganism. 4) Vehicle transmission It refers to transmission of infection by contaminated items such as food, water, medications, devices and equipment.",

        "exp": "Flash light pumped dye laser \"Non blanching bosselated lesion on right side of the face suggests po wine stain\" Po wine stain (PWS), also called nevus fiammeus, is a congenital, cutaneous vascular malformation involving post-capillary venules which produce a light pink to red to dark-red- violet discoloration of human skin. PWS occurs in an estimated 3 children per 1, 000 live bihs, affecting males and females and all racial groups equally. There appears to be no hereditary predilection for PWS within families. There are no known risk factors or ways to prevent PWS. The most likely hypothesis for the development of PWS is the deficiency or absence of surrounding neurons regulating blood. flow through the ectatic post-capillary venules. - As a result, the blood vessels are unable to constrict normally and remain permanently dilated. - They are \"non, blanching\". PWS is a progressive vascular malformation of the skin -PWS remain throughout life; there is no involution. PWS are well demarcated and. 1lat and grow propoionately in surface area with the child. In infants and young children, PWS are flat red macules. However, the lesions tend to darken progressively to purple and, by adult age. often become raised as a result of the development of vascular papules bosselated or nodules. These changes in color and contour are attributed to progressive ectasia of the abnornull dermal vascular plexus. - If left untreated, PWS often become incompatible with normal life due to the development of vascular nodules on the skin surface which can often bleed spontaneously with incidental trauma. For all of the above reasons, it is essential to begin treatment of PWS as early as possible. The treatment of PWS early will prevent the development of hyperophic component of the lession. - \"The pulsed dye laser in conjunction with cryogen spray cooling (\"dynamic cooling device\" or \"DCD\") is now the treatment of choice for PWS\". Yellow light produced by the pulsed dye laser penetrates up to 2 mm into the skin and is preferentially absorbed by hemoglobin within the dilated PWS blood vessels. The heat adsorbed within the vessel lumen causes blood vessel damage which is evidenced by intense purpura (\"bruised\" appearance of the skin). The purpura heals, later on and the lesion is cured. Several treatment sessions spaced at 4-8 week intervals are required for maximum efficacy. The number of treatments required. for maximum PWS fading can he variable and unpredictable. Treatment side effects are mainly limited to post-operative swelling and purpura, which generally resolves within 2 weeks. With the addition of cryogen spray cooling. the risks of scarring or changes in the normal skin pigmentation are minimal after pulsed dye laser therapy performed l an experienced physician. Multiple pulsed dye laser devices are now available for PWS treatment, each with its own unique wavelength and pulse duration. Changing the wavelength or pulse duration of the laser can result in substantial PWS fading not previously observed with single device therapy. Moreover, several devices are sometimes used during an extended treatment protocol in order to destroy vessels of different sizes.",

The qualitative data can be placed on 2 scales - i) Nominal ii) Ordinal. Nominal scale - Nominal scale data are divided into qualitative categories or groups, such as male / female, black / white, died / cured, attacked / not attacked, vaccinated / not vaccinate, urban / sub urban / rural. - There is no implication of order or ratio, means that the data cannot be placed in a meaningful order. Ordinal Scale - Here the data can be placed into categories that can be rank ordered (eg. students may be ranked / 2nd / 3rd / 4th in their class or into grades A/B/C, the activity of an animal can be rated on a scale of 1 to 6, hardness scale for water etc.) However, there is no information about the size of the interval ie no conclusion can be drawn about whether the difference between the first and second students is the same as the difference between the second and third. Variables in the form of mild, moderate and severe (or very satisfied, satisfied and dissatisfied) are analyzed by ordinal scale as they can be arranged in a meaningful order but there is no information about the size of the interval between them. Quantitative data The quantitative data have a magnitude ie they can be measured. Eg. - height, weight, blood pressure, serum cholesteral level, temperature, number of children in a family etc. Quantitative data can be measured on 2 scales i) Interval ii) Ratio scales Interval scale - Interval scale data are like ordinal data in that they can be placed in a meaningful order; in addition, they have meaningful intervals between items, which can be measured. - eg: Temperature on the Celsius scale (the difference between 80 deg and 70 deg is the same as between 40 deg and 30deg) - However, interval scale data do not have an absolute zero, ratios of the scores are not meaningful ie 80deg C of Celsius temperature is not twice as hot as 40degC because 0degC does not indicate a complete absence of heat. Ratio Scale - A ratio scale has the same propeies as an interval scale, however, because it has an absolute zero, meaningful ratio do exist. - eg. weights, time, blood pressure, temperature on the Kelvin scale (not Celsius scale) On the Kelvin scale, zero degrees indicate an absolute absence of heat, just as a zero pulse indicates an absolute absence of heabeat. Thus we can say that 400 K is twice as hot as 200 K. Dichotomous Scale is a type of nominal scale in which nominal data fall into only two groups eg black / white, died / cured, failed / passed.",

        "question": "Plaque is transmitted by: September 2005",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Flea Plague is a zoonotic disease circulating mainly among small animals and their fleas. The bacteria Yersinia pestis can also infect humans. It is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact, inhalation and rarely, ingestion of infective materials. Infected persons usually sta with \"flu-like\" symptoms after an incubation period of 3-7 days. Patients typically experience the sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea. Clinical plague infection manifests itself in three forms depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic. Bubonic form is the most common form of plague resulting from the bite of an infective flea. Plague bacillus enters the skin from the site of the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node. The lymph node then becomes inflamed because the plague bacteria, Yersinia pestis or Y. pestis, will replicate here in high numbers. The swollen lymph node is called a \"bubo\" which is very painful and can become suppurated as an open sore in advanced stage of infection; Septicaemic form of plague occurs when infection spreads directly through the bloodstream without evidence of a \"bubo\". More commonly advanced stages of bubonic plague will result in the presence of Y. pestis in the blood. Septicaemic plague may result from flea bites and from direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin. Pneumonic form of plague is the most virulent and least common form of plague. Typically, pneumonic form is due to a secondary spread from advanced infection of an initial bubonic form. Primary pneumonic plague results from inhalation of aerosolized infective droplets and can be transmitted from human to human without involvement of fleas or animals.",

The person or persons who can perform such terminations. The place where such terminations can be performed. The conditions under which a pregnancy can be terminated under the MTPAct. 1971: There are 5 conditions that have been identified in the Act: Medical - where continuation of the pregnancy might endanger the mother's life or cause grave injury to her physical or mental health. Eugenic - where there is substantial risk of the child being born with serious handicaps due to physical or mental abnormalities. Humanitarian - where pregnancy is the result of rape Socio-economic - where actual or reasonably foreseeable environments (whether social or economic could lead to risk of injury to the health of the mother). Failure of contraceptive devices - The anguish caused by an unwanted pregnancy resulting from a failure of any contraceptive device or method can be presumed to constitute a grave mental injury to the health of the mother. This condition is a unique feature of the Indian law and viually allows aboion on request, in view of the difficulty of proving that a pregnancy was not caused by failure of contraception. The written consent of the guardian is necessary before performing aboion in women under 18 years of age, and in lunatics even if they are older than 18 years. The person or persons who can perform aboion The Act provides safeguards to the mother by authorising only a Registered Medical Practitioner having experience in gynaecology and obstetrics to perform aboion where the length of pregnancy does not exceed 12 weeks. o However, where the pregnancy exceeds 12 weeks and is not more than 20 weeks, the opinion of two Ragistered o Medical Practitioners is necessary to terminate the pregnancy. Where aboion can be done The Act stipulates that no termination of pregnancy shall be made at any place other than a hospital established or maintained by Government or a place approved for the purpose of this Act by Government. Aboion services are provided in hospitals in strict confidence. The name of the aboion seeker is kept confidential, since aboion has been treated statutorily as a personal matter.",

The value of the survival function between successive distinct sampled observations is assumed to be constant. o An impoant advantages of the Kaplan-Meier curve is that the method can take into account \"censored\" data? losses from the sample before the final outcome is observed (for instance, if a patient withdraws from a study).",

The woman is required to inse test sticks dipped in her urine The device then calculates the likely date of ovulation well in advance and allows for sperm survival. She is thus shown green light days when conception is unlikely and 'red light' days when conception may well occur o With perfect use failure rates are in the region of 6/100 woman years. o However more typical user failure rates are much higher. Persna has advantage for couples who wish to use natural family planning in that it takes away much of the subjectvity of the symptothermal method and its greater predictive accuracy results in fewer abstinence days (8 on average, compared to 12) however the best use failure rate is still high compared to other methods and it should therefore, be viewed as most suitable for couples spacing rather then preventing a pregnancy.",
