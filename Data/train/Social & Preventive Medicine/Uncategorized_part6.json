In addition to the exposures that the study is investigating, there may be other factors that are associated with the exposure and are also risk factors for the disease. If the prevalence of these other factors differs between groups being compared, they will disto the observed association between the disease and exposure under study. Such variables may paially or completely account for any apparent association between an exposure variable and disease. These distoing factors are called confounding factors or variables. Thus a Confounding factor is defined as one which is associated with both the exposure and the disease and is distributed unequally in study and control groups. It is itself a risk. factor. for the disease. A hypothetical example would be a study of coffee drinking and lung cancer. If coffee drinkers were also more likely to be cigarette smokers, and the study measured coffee drinking but not smoking, the results may seem to show that coffee drinking increases the risk of lung cancer, which may not be true. However, if a confounding factor (in this example, smoking) is recognized, adjustments can be made in the study design or data analysis so that the factor does not confound the study results. Confounding can be neutralized by matching. Matching is defined as the process by which we select control in such a way that they are similar to cases With regard to confounding factors",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Asbestosis Mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer of the pleura and peritoneum, has been shown to have a strong association with the crocidolite variety of asbestos Mesothelioma/Malignant mesothelioma It is a rare form of cancer that develops from the mesothelium. It is usually caused by exposure to asbestos. Its most common site is the pleura, but it may also occur in the peritoneum, the pericardium, or the tunica vaginalis. Most people who develop mesothelioma have worked on jobs where they inhaled asbestos, or they have been exposed to asbestos dust and fiber in other ways. It has also been suggested that washing the clothes of a family member who worked with asbestos can put a person at risk for developing mesothelioma. Unlike lung cancer, there is no association between mesothelioma and smoking, but smoking greatly increases the risk of other asbestos-induced cancers. The symptoms of mesothelioma include shoness of breath due to pleural effusion or chest wall pain, and general symptoms such as weight loss. The diagnosis may be suspected with chest X-ray and CT scan, and is confirmed with a biopsy and microscopic examination. A thoracoscopy can be used to take biopsies. It allows the introduction of substances such as talc to obliterate the pleural space (pleurodesis), which prevents more fluid from accumulating and pressing on the lung. Despite treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy or sometimes surgery, the disease carries a poor prognosis. Indeed, the relationship between asbestos and mesothelioma is so strong that many consider mesothelioma a \"signal\" or \"sentinel\" tumor. In rare cases, mesothelioma has also been associated with irradiation, intrapleural thorium dioxide (Thorotrast), and inhalation of other fibrous silicates, such as erionite. Screening tests might diagnose mesothelioma earlier than conventional methods thus improving the survival prospects for patients. The serum osteopontin level might be useful in screening asbestos-exposed people for mesothelioma. The level of soluble mesothelin-related protein is elevated in the serum of about 75% of patients at diagnosis and it has been suggested that it may be useful for screening.",

        "question": "Thiamine deficiency is seen in all except",
        "exp": "Homocysteinemia Thiamine was the first vitamin to be identified and is therefore called as vitamin Bl. Thiamine deficiency or beriberi refers to the lack of thiamine pyrophosphate, the active form of the vitamin. Thiamine pyrophosphate acts as a coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism through the decarboxylation of alphaketoacids and in the formation of glucose by acting as a coenzyme for the transketolase in the pentose monophosphate pathway Causes of Thiamine deficiency Persons may become deficient in thiamine either by not ingesting enough vitamin B-1 through the diet or by excess use, which may occur in hypehyroidism, pregnancy, lactation, or fever (sates of high energy consumption, such as hypehyroidism, pregnancy, or severe illness, require more thiamine and other nutrients.) Prolonged diarrhea may impair the body's ability to absorb vitamin B-1, and severe liver disease impairs its use. Decreased absorption is seen in - Diarrhea - Chronic intestinal disease - Alcoholism - Malnutrition - Gastric bypass surgery - Malabsorption syndrome - Celiac and tropical sprue - Hyperemesis gravidarum - Long term starvation - Fad diets( Fad diets often do not contain necessary amounts of thiamine) Increased depletion is seen in - Diuretic therapies - Peritoneal dialysis - Hemodialysis(Dialysis robs thiamine from the circulation) Alcohol is known to interfere directly with the absorption of thiamine and with the synthesis of thiamine pyrophosphate. ( thiamine should always be replenished when refeeding a patient with alcoholism, as carbohydrate repletion without adequate thiamine can precipitate acute thiamine deficiency.) Beriberi has been repoed among refugees who are relying on emergency food aids. This is due to the lack of available micronutrition supplementation Food faddism and fad diet are terms which refer to the tendency for idiosyncratic diets and eating patterns. A fad diet is supposed and promoted to improve health but may do nothing at all, or even have the opposite results if it is nutritionally unbalanced and unconfirmed by scientific studies Developing countries are known to have more vitamin deficiency problems in general Pathophysiology (Beriberi) In healthy individuals who are deprived of thiamine, thiamine stores are depleted in approximately 1 month. However, within a week of no thiamine intake, healthy people develop a resting tachycardia, weakness, and decreased deep tendon reflexes and some people develop a peripheral neuropathy. Nervous system involvement is termed dry beriberi. Dry beriberi involves both the peripheral and the central nervous systems. - Peripheral nerve involvement is typically a symmetric motor and sensory neuropathy with pain, parasthesias, and loss of reflexes. The legs are affected more than the arms. - Central nervous system involvement results in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. - Wernicke's encephalopathy consists of nystagmus progressing to ophthalmoplegia, truncal ataxia, and confnsion. When there is additional loss of memory and a confabulatory psychosis, the syndrome is known as Wernike. Korsakoff syndrome. Wet beriberi is the term used for the cardiovascular involvement of thiamine deficiency. Wet beriberi is characterized by marked peripheral vasodilation resulting in high-output hea. failure with dyspnea, tachycardia, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary and peripheral edema, with warm extremities mimicking cellulitis. Diagnosis In most instances, the clinical response to empiric thiamine therapy is used to suppo a diagnosis of thiamine deficiency. The most commonly used and widely available biochemical tests are measurement of erythrocyte transketolase activity and urinary thiamine excretion",

        "question": "A group tested for a drug shows 60% improvement as against a standard group showing 40% improvement. The best test to test the significance of result is -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Chi-square test Chi square test o Is used when the observation are in the form of propoions (for qualitative data) o The outcome are in clear cut answers; yes or no. As in the example the HBs. Ag is either present or not present. In contrast when the observation is normally distributed in the population e. g blood pressure, blood sugar; student test is used. o In the example comparing the occurence of hepatitis B surface antigen in medical and dental students, use of chi square analysis is appropriate because the outcome variables are dichomatous. Students are classified by the presence or absence of HBs. Ag. Student t test o is used when the outcome variable is normally distributed in population (for quantitative data) e. g blood pressure, blood glucose. In the example student t test is used to assess the difference between mean systolic pressure of pregnant and non pregnant women ( to know the effect of pregnancy on mean systolic blood pressure) because mean systolic blood pressure is normally distributed in the population. Every single lady has a mean systolic blood pressure. It may be low or high, but she has a value of mean systolic blood pressure. Students t test may be following types: i) Unpaired t test (Independent t test): It compares the mean of two small samples: The data is unpaired from two independent sample. for example, blood sugar concentration is measured in two different group (A group of 10 patients and other group of 8 patient). To test the significance of difference between the means of the two groups, unpaired t test is used. ii) Paired t test: It compares the mean in paired data, before and after the intervention from same sample. For example, Blood sugar level in a sample of 10 patients is measure before giving and after giving the oral hypoglycemic. In this condition paired t test is used. Chi-square test Vs Student t test In the example student t test is used to assess the difference between mean systolic pressure of pregnant and non pregnant women ( to know the effect of pregnancy on mean systolic blood pressure) because mean systolic blood pressure is normally distributed in the population. Every single lady has a mean systolic blood pressure. It may be low or high, but she has a value of mean systolic blood pressure. o But suppose we change the example in a way that we make a clear cut definition of hypertension ( such as mean systolic blood pressure over 140 mm of Hg will be taken to be hypertension) and then look for hypertension among pregnant and non-pregnant women. o The test now used to analyse the outcome will be chi square test since the outcomes are now in the form of dichomatous data i. e yes or no (a woman is either hypeensive or not hypeensive. This is in contrast to mean systolic blood pressure which was normally distributed among ladies; every lady had one value of mean systolic blood pressure). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (F test/ F ratio) o ANOVA is considered as an extension of the student t test for the significance of the difference between two sample means. The student t test can be used only for making just one comparison (between two sample means), or between a sample mean and hypothesized population mean. ANOVA is used when more than one comparison is to be made (When means of more than two groups are being compared). o For example, BP is measured in more than two groups of men (married, unmarried, widowed, separated and divorced). In this situation ANOVA test is best. Fisher's test (Fisher's exact test) o It is same as Chi square test; the difference being in sample size which is small for Fishers' t test; (i) When sample size is big, chi square test is used. (ii) When sample size is small fisher test is used. The chi-square test is acceptable when all the expected cell values are greater than 1 and no more the 20% of cells have expected value below 5. Otherwise fisher's exact test is recommended. o For example, a study is under taken to determine whether smoking is associated with chronic bronchitis and the observed frequencies are:- Chronic bronchitis No bronchitis Smoking 6 4 10 No Smoking 2 7 9 8 11 l9 o Now we will figure the expected frequencies:- There are all together 8 chronic bronchitis patients among 19 person examined (a propoion of 8/19); and 11 persons out of 19 have no chronic bronchitis (a propoion of 11/19). The expected frequency will be:- Expected frequency of chronic bronchitis in smokers = Total number of smokers (10) x propoion of persons having chronic bronchitis (8/19) = 4. 2 Expect frequency of smokers not developing bronchitis = Total number of smokers (10) x propoion of person not developing bronchitis (11/19) = 5. 7. Expected frequency of chronic bronchitis in nonsmokers = Total number of non-smokers (9) x propoion of persons having bronchitis (8/19) = 3. 7 Expected frequency of nonsmoker not developing branchitis = total number of non-smoker (9) x propoion of person not developing brachitic (11/19) = 5. 2. Chronic Bronchitis No Bronchitis Smoking 10 (8/19)= 4. 2 10 (11/19)=5. 7 No Smoking 9 (8/19)= 3. 7 9 (11/19) = 5. 2 Because, 50% of cells (2 out of 4) have an expected frequency less then 5, fisher exact test should be used not chi-square test. Z-test o Z-test is a variant of student t test. It involves the same steps as t-test and can be used when the sample is large enough (n > 100) for the standard detion to provide a reliable estimate of standard error. Mc Nemar test: It is used for paired dichomatous data i. e. it is similar to paired t test, the difference being that paired t test is used for variable which is normally distributed in population such as mean systolic B. P., Serum sodium Concentration where as Mc Nemar test is used when the data are in dichomatous form (i. e. yes & no -either the person is hypeensive or non hypeensive, either he is diseased or not diseased). Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test (mann-whitiney 'II' test) o It is non parametric equalent of the unpaired t tests. Similar to unpaired t test it is used when data is unpaired from two independent sample. However, it is used for qualitative data (as all non-parametric tests) ---> compares the percentage, fractions and propoions in two unpaired samples. Wilcoxon Signed - Rank Test o It is nonparametric equalent ofpaired t test. It is used when data (qualitative) is paired (before and after intervention) from the same group --> compares the percentage, fractions and propoions in two paired samples. Sign-test Sign test is also non-parametric equalent to paired t test and is very much like wilcoxon signed ranked test. However, instead of determining the ranks of the absolute difference we just keep track of the number of positive or negative differences. o That means, both wilcoxon signed ranked test and sign test compare percentage, propoions and fractions in pair data. However, Wilcoxon signed rank test determines the ranks of the absolute differences and sign test keeps track the number of positive and/or negative differences.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Coagulation Pathway Severe maternal zinc deficiency has been associated with congenital malformations or spontaneous aboions Zinc deficiency has been repoed to result in sexual infantilism (zinc is required for proper reproduction) Zinc is required for wound healing. Zinc enhances cell growth and division. Zinc Zinc is found in nearly 100 specific enzymes, serves as structural ions in transcription factors and is stored and transferred in metallothioneins. It is \"typically the second most abundant transition metal in organisms\" after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. In proteins, Zn ions are often coordinated to the amino acid side chains of aspaic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine and histidine. There are 2-4 grams of zinc distributed throughout the human body. Most zinc is in the brain, muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest concentrations in the prostate and pas of the eye. Semen is paicularly rich in zinc, which is a key factor in prostate gland function and reproductive organ growth. In humans, zinc plays \"ubiquitous biological roles\". It interacts with \"a wide range of organic ligands\", and has roles in the metabolism of RNA and DNA, signal transduction, and gene expression. It also regulates apoptosis. In the brain, zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons and can \"modulate brain excitability\". It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and so in learning. However it has been called \"the brain's dark horse\" since it also can be a neurotoxin, suggesting zinc homeostasis plays a critical role in normal functioning of the brain and central nervous system. Zinc is an efficient Lewis acid, making it a useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions. The metal also has a flexible coordination geometry, which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions. Two examples of zinc-containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase, which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Interviewer bias Information (Observer or misclassification bias) o Information bias is a type of connitive bias o Are when propoion of subjects misclassified on exposure or disease. o Information bias occurs due to people's curiosity and confusion of goals when trying to choose a course of action. o It may be of following types i) Repoing bias Individual with severe disease tends to have complete records therefore more complete information about exposures and greater association found. ii) Recall bias (memory bias) Those who have disease (cases) have a greater sensitivity for recalling exposure than those who dont have disease (controls). iii) Interviewer bias Caused by the action of the interviewer, e. g., Interviewer generally devote more time to cases as compared to controls. iv) Hawthorne bias (Attention bias) It is caused by change in behavior of human subjects of an experiment, simply becasue they know that they are being observed. For example, if we want to study the smoking as a risk factor for lung carcinoma and we take 2 groups (50 smokers and 50 nonsmoker) and follow them for 10 years. It may be possible that over the time study subjects may change their behavior, e. g. 5 out of 50 smokers quit smoking behavior. This will cause Hawthorne bias. It is quite obvious that Hawthorne effect will occur in prospective studies (where the study subject are being observed), e. g. in Coho Study. This bias will not occur in retrospective study as the study subjects are not observed rather their history is taken. Coming back to question o Interviewer bias occurs because the investigator knows beforehand, the paicular procedure or therapy to which the patient has been subjected. o This prior information may lead him to focus more on the group which he knows, is more susceptible. o In the question the physician already knows that children without BCG scar (nonimmunized) children are more prone to develop Tuberculosis than patients with BCG scar (immunized) children. o This prior information will lead him to investigate children without BCG scar more thoroughly as he knows, that being unimmunized these children are more prone to develop T. B. o On the other hand while investigating children with BCG scar, the interviewer will be bit careless as he knows that these children are already immunized. o This will automatically lead to detection of more cases of T.

The disease is caused by a virus belonging to the family flaviviridae, which also includes yellow fever and dengue fever. There are a variety of animals thought to be reservoir hosts for the disease, including porcupines, rats, squirrels, mice and shrews. The vector for disease transmission is Haemaphysalis spinigera, a forest tick. Humans contract infection from the bite of nymphs of the tick. The disease has a morbidity rate of 2-10%, and affects 100-500 people annually. The symptoms of the disease include a high fever with frontal headaches, followed by haemorrhagic symptoms, such as bleeding from the nasal cavity, throat, and gums, as well as gastrointestinal bleeding. An affected person may recover in two weeks time, but the convalescent period is typically very long, lasting for several months. There will be muscle aches and weakness during this period and the affected person is unable to engage in physical activities. Prophylaxis by vaccination, as well as preventive measures like protective clothing, tick control, and mosquito control are advised. An attenuated live vaccine is now available.

(BACKWARD LOOKING STUDY) Advantages of case control studies Relatively quick and easy to undeake. Relatively cheap to undeake. Only method useful in rare diseases. Not enmeshed in problems of follow-up as the data is collected at one point in time. Can be used to study the effect of many exposure variables on a single disease outcome. Drawbacks of case control studies Prone to selection and recall bias. Can't measure relative risk or provide incidence estimates. (Only odd's ratio can be calculated from the type of study, which is a rough estimate of relative risk. But when the disease in question is a rare one odd's ratio is almost equal to relative risk.) Sometimes the occurrence of the exposure in terms of time, i. e. whether it occurred before the disease may be difficult to estimate. Can't be used for rare exposures.

Surveillance Surveillance is the continuous scrutiny of the factors that determine the occurrence and distribution of disease and other conditions of ill health. In simple words \"surveillance is systemic ongoing collection, collation and analysis of data and the timely dissemination of information to those who need to know so that action can be taken\". According to above definition, monitoring becomes one specific and essential pa of the broader concept embraced by surveillance. Following example will help to differentiate these two? In tobacco control - Surveillance includes collection of data about prevalence of tobacco use, its health and enconomic consequences, its socio-cultural determinats and tobacco control policy responses and tobacco industry activities. By collecting all these information effective tobacco control interventions can be taken. Monitoring will continously oversight the activities of this tobacco control interventions, to ensure that they are proceeding according to plan. It keeps track of achievement, resources supply and utilization, staff movement, etc, so that if anything goes wrong, immediate corrective measure can be taken. So, In surveillance, data is collected & collated, and this information is used to know what action to be taken - making a plan of action. Monitoring than keep a watch that this plan of action is working properly It is a pa of continued surveillance. \"Surveillance is a systemic method for continuous monitoring of disease in a population, in order to be able to detect changes in disease patterns and then to control them\".

It breeds in aificial stagnant accumulations of water in and around human dwellings (discarded storage jars, broken bottles, buckets etc.) Only females suck blood meals (Males feed on nectar and plant juices). The females need blood to mature her eggs The female mosquitoes are fearless, day time biters. They bite repeatedly to have 1-3 blood meals. Eggs are laid singly. The Cigar shaped eggs are laid on damp surfaces in areas likely to temporarily flood, such as tree holes and manmade containers. In warm climates eggs may develo in as little as two days, whereas in cooler temperate climates, development can take upto a week.. Laid eggs can survive for very long periods in a dry or desiccated state, often snore than a year. However they hatch immediately once submerged in water. This makes the control of Aedes aegypti difficult. Aedes mosquito transmit following diseases - Yellow fever (not in India) - Dengue - Dengue hemorrhagic fever - Chikungunya fever - Chikungunya hemorrhagic fever - Rift valley fever - Filaria (not in India where it is transmitted by culex & other mosquitoes) The transmission cycle of dengue is Man-mosquito-man The transmission of disease agent (dengue virus & Flavivirus fibricus of yellow fever) between humans occurs from repeated biting by the mosquito when the mosquito injects saliva that acts as an anticoagulant The extrinsic incubation period during which the virus multiplies in the mosquito & the mosquito becomes infective is - 8-10 days in dengue fever & - 8-12 days in yellow fever (In the opiton (d) the extrinsic incubation period is 7-8 days i. e. near about above).",

For exmaple ECG and Echocardiography are two procedures used in the diagnosis of VSD. When used in Parallel mode the pt. will be considered to have VSD, if any of the test give positive result (even if the other test gives negative result) For example Suppose 10 different diagnostic tests are used to diagnose a paicular disease If test are used in Series mode The pt. will be declared positive only when all the tests give positive result. Even if 9 tests give positive and one in negative pt. will be considered negative. Because even a single positive test is considered positive True positivity increases - Sensitivity increases.

This type of bias can be eliminated by double blinding. Interviewer's bias may occur when the interviewer knows the hypothesis and also knows who the cases are. This prior information may lead to question the cases more thoroughly than controls regarding a positive history of the suspected casual factor. This type of bias can be eliminated by double-blinding. In a double-blind experiment, neither the individuals nor the researchers know who belongs to the control group and the experimental group. Only after all the data have been recorded (and in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which individuals are which. Performing an experiment in double-blind fashion is a way to lessen the influence of the prejudices and unintentional physical cues on the results (the placebo effect, observer bias, and experimenter's bias). Random assignment of the subject to the experimental or control group is a critical pa of double-blind research design. The key that identifies the subjects and which group they belonged to is kept by a third pay and not given to the researchers until the study is over. Double-blind methods can be applied to any experimental situation where there is the possibility that the results will be affected by conscious or unconscious bias on the pa of the experimenter. Computer-controlled experiments are sometimes also erroneously referred to as double-blind experiments, since software may not cause the type of direct bias between researcher and subject.",

AFP surveillance is done in all children < 5 years of age AFP surveillance is carried out in all children below 15 years of age AFP Surveillance o Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is carried out to identify all remaining infected areas, monitor progress towards eradication and target supplementary immunization appropriately. o The term AFP means paralysis of acute onset involving limbs leading to flaccidity. Poliomylelitis is most impoant etiology of AFP, other causes are - GBS (Guillain-Barre syndrome), transverse myelitis and traumatic neuritis. o AFP surveillance aims at detecting cases of AFP and repoing them immediately to district immunization officer. Surveillance is carried out for all cases of AFP and not just for poliomyelitis. All cases of AFP are repoed, regardless of the final diagnosis. As paralytic poliomyelitis is one cause of AFP, maintaining a high sensitivity of AFP repoing will ensure that all cases of paralytic poliomyelitis are detected, repoed and investigated, resulting in preventive central measures to interrupt the transmission of disease. o The aim of AFP surveillance is to detect polio virus transmission, and the earlier the stool is collected, the greater the chance of detecting polio virus. o WHO recommends the immediate repoing and investigation of every case of AFP in children less than 15 yrs (As AFP in a person > 15 yrs is unlikely to be polio. Still, AFP surveillance must be flexible enough to repo any case of AFP in an adult, if suspected to be due to poliomyelitis) Cases of AFP are classified as Polio if: Wild polio virus is isolated from any stool specimen. Cases of AFP without isolation of wild polio virus may be classified as 'polio compatible' if: Stool specimens were inadequate and Residual weakness was present 60 days after onset of paralysis or 60-day follow-up was not done (due to death or absence) and 'Expe review' concludes that these cases could not be discarded as 'non-polio' based on available data. o WI-10 recommends obtaining 2 stool samples from AFP cases within 14 days of paralysis onset and sent to WHO accredited laboratory using Reverse cold chain. Stool samples should be taken at least 24 hours apa. o All repoed cases of AFP should be investigated by District immunization officer 'within 48 hours' after notification. o AFP surveillance is evaluated by 2 key indicators: a) The sensitivity of repoing (target being non-polio AFP rate of at least 1 case per 100, 000 children aged less than 15 years. this is the 'background' rate of AFP among children. Non-polio causes of AFP such as GBS, transverse myelitis, & traumatic neuritis account for this background rate.) b) The completeness of specimen collection (target being 2 adequate stool specimens from at least 80 per cent of all AFP cases). Mop-up Activity Mop-up activity is a house-to-house activity where two rounds of polio immunization, 4-6 weeks apa are conducted to limit the transmission of wild poliovirus. o Under the mop-up activity, children below 5 years of age are covered in affected and neighbouring districts around every detected positive polio case. The basic strategy for eradicating polio consists of High infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral polio vaccine in the first year of life; National Immunization Days during which every child below 5 years gets 2 additional doses of OPV on 2 days separated by 4 to 6 weeks. Surveillance of AFP to identify all reservoirs of wild polio virus transmission through repoing and laboratory testing of all cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children under fifteen years of age;.

        "exp": "Flash light pumped dye laser \"Non blanching bosselated lesion on right side of the face suggests po wine stain\" Po wine stain (PWS), also called nevus fiammeus, is a congenital, cutaneous vascular malformation involving post-capillary venules which produce a light pink to red to dark-red- violet discoloration of human skin. PWS occurs in an estimated 3 children per 1, 000 live bihs, affecting males and females and all racial groups equally. There appears to be no hereditary predilection for PWS within families. There are no known risk factors or ways to prevent PWS. The most likely hypothesis for the development of PWS is the deficiency or absence of surrounding neurons regulating blood. flow through the ectatic post-capillary venules. - As a result, the blood vessels are unable to constrict normally and remain permanently dilated. - They are \"non, blanching\". PWS is a progressive vascular malformation of the skin -PWS remain throughout life; there is no involution. PWS are well demarcated and. 1lat and grow propoionately in surface area with the child. In infants and young children, PWS are flat red macules. However, the lesions tend to darken progressively to purple and, by adult age. often become raised as a result of the development of vascular papules bosselated or nodules. These changes in color and contour are attributed to progressive ectasia of the abnornull dermal vascular plexus. - If left untreated, PWS often become incompatible with normal life due to the development of vascular nodules on the skin surface which can often bleed spontaneously with incidental trauma. For all of the above reasons, it is essential to begin treatment of PWS as early as possible. The treatment of PWS early will prevent the development of hyperophic component of the lession. - \"The pulsed dye laser in conjunction with cryogen spray cooling (\"dynamic cooling device\" or \"DCD\") is now the treatment of choice for PWS\". Yellow light produced by the pulsed dye laser penetrates up to 2 mm into the skin and is preferentially absorbed by hemoglobin within the dilated PWS blood vessels. The heat adsorbed within the vessel lumen causes blood vessel damage which is evidenced by intense purpura (\"bruised\" appearance of the skin). The purpura heals, later on and the lesion is cured. Several treatment sessions spaced at 4-8 week intervals are required for maximum efficacy. The number of treatments required. for maximum PWS fading can he variable and unpredictable. Treatment side effects are mainly limited to post-operative swelling and purpura, which generally resolves within 2 weeks. With the addition of cryogen spray cooling. the risks of scarring or changes in the normal skin pigmentation are minimal after pulsed dye laser therapy performed l an experienced physician. Multiple pulsed dye laser devices are now available for PWS treatment, each with its own unique wavelength and pulse duration. Changing the wavelength or pulse duration of the laser can result in substantial PWS fading not previously observed with single device therapy. Moreover, several devices are sometimes used during an extended treatment protocol in order to destroy vessels of different sizes.",

Case series study simply describes presentation of a disease in a no. of patients. It does not follow the patients for a period & it uses no control or comparison group. Therefore it cannot establish a cause effect relationship & it's validity is entirely a matter for reader to decide, whether it is useful or wohless. Case repo study: a special term form case series in which only one patient is described - this too may be very valuable or viually wohless. Case control study: It is a analytical study in which comparison of people who do have the disease (the cases) with otherwise similar people who don't have the disease (controls) is made. These are retrospective studies. Case control studies sta with outcomes or dependant variables. They then look back into past for possible independent variable (that may have caused the disease) to see if a possible risk factor was present more frequently in cases thean controls. Coho Studies: This focusses on factors related to development of a disease. A coho (group of people with common characteristics) that does not have the disease of interest is selected & then observed for an extended period. Some of the members will already have been exposed to a suspected risk factor for the disease & others will eventually become exposed. Incidence of disease can be studied. It is also known as followup, or longitudinal incidence or prospective study. Clinical trial: It is an experiemtnal method of epidemiological study. Clinical trials aim to isolate one factor (such as use of a drug) & examine its contributions to patients health by holding all other factors as constant as possible.

Ordinal Scale - Here the data can be placed into categories that can be rank ordered (eg. students may be ranked / 2nd / 3rd / 4th in their class or into grades A/B/C, the activity of an animal can be rated on a scale of 1 to 6, hardness scale for water etc.) However, there is no information about the size of the interval ie no conclusion can be drawn about whether the difference between the first and second students is the same as the difference between the second and third. Variables in the form of mild, moderate and severe (or very satisfied, satisfied and dissatisfied) are analyzed by ordinal scale as they can be arranged in a meaningful order but there is no information about the size of the interval between them. Quantitative data The quantitative data have a magnitude ie they can be measured. Eg. - height, weight, blood pressure, serum cholesteral level, temperature, number of children in a family etc. Quantitative data can be measured on 2 scales i) Interval ii) Ratio scales Interval scale - Interval scale data are like ordinal data in that they can be placed in a meaningful order; in addition, they have meaningful intervals between items, which can be measured. - eg: Temperature on the Celsius scale (the difference between 80 deg and 70 deg is the same as between 40 deg and 30deg) - However, interval scale data do not have an absolute zero, ratios of the scores are not meaningful ie 80deg C of Celsius temperature is not twice as hot as 40degC because 0degC does not indicate a complete absence of heat. Ratio Scale - A ratio scale has the same propeies as an interval scale, however, because it has an absolute zero, meaningful ratio do exist. - eg. weights, time, blood pressure, temperature on the Kelvin scale (not Celsius scale) On the Kelvin scale, zero degrees indicate an absolute absence of heat, just as a zero pulse indicates an absolute absence of heabeat. Thus we can say that 400 K is twice as hot as 200 K. Dichotomous Scale is a type of nominal scale in which nominal data fall into only two groups eg black / white, died / cured, failed / passed.",

        "exp": "Fluorosis is the most common cause of dental caries in children Dental caries is not caused by fluorosis, but by fluorine deficiency. Moreever most common cause of dental caries in children is poor oral hygiene. Endemic Fluorosis Endemic fluorosis occurs when drinking water contains increased amounts of fluorine (3-5 mg/L) Various toxic manifestations of endemic fluorosis are: a. Dental fluorosis - Fluoride is deposited in the enamel of teeth when excess fluoride is ingested during the years of tooth calcification (i. e. during the first 7 yrs of life) - Earliest signs of dental fluorosis is molting of dental enamel. The teeth loose their shine and chalk white patches develop. Later the white patches turn yellow or sometimes brown or black. In severe cases, loss of enamel gives the teeth a corroded appearance. - Mottling is best seen on the upper incisors. - Mottling is almost entirely confined to the permanent teeth and develops only during the period of formation. b. Skeletal fluorosis - Chronic ingestion of excessive amount of fluorine (3. 0 to 6. 0 mg/L or more) results in skeletal fluorosis. - There is a heavy fluoride deposition in the skeleton. - Fluoride deposition leads to Osteosclerosis & calcification of the ligaments. In the early clinical stage of skeletal fluorosis, symptoms include pains in the bones and joints; sensations of burning, pricking, and tingling in the limbs; muscle weakness; chronic fatigue; and gastrointestinal disorders and reduced appetite. - In the next clinical stage, pains in the bones become constant and some of the ligaments begin to calcify. Osteoporosis may occur in the long bones, and early symptoms of osteosclerosis are present. Stiffness in the back occurs, especially in the lumbar region, followed by dorsal and cervical spines. - Restriction of the spine movements is the earliest clinical sign of fluorosis. The stiffness increases steadily until the entire spine becomes one continuous column of bone manifesting a condition referred to as 'poker back'. - The stiffness that first appears in the spine soon spreads to various joints in the limbs owing to the involvement of the joint capsules, the related ligaments, and the tendinous attachments to the bones. - The involvement of the ribs gradually reduces the movement of the chest during breathing, which finally becomes mainly abdominal. When that happens the chest assumes a barrel shape. With the increasing immobilization of the joints due to contractures, flexion deformities may develop at hips, knees and other joints, which make the patient bedridden. - Despite the fact that the entire bone structure has become affected, the mental faculties remain unimpaired till the last stage is reached. - The stage at which skeletal fluorosis becomes crippling usually occurs between 30 and 50 years of age in the endemic regions c. Genu valgum - In recent years, a new form of fluorosis characterised by genu valgum and osteoporosis of the lower limbs has been repoed from some districts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. - This form of fluorosis was observed in people whose staple diet was Sorghum (jowar). It was found that diets based on sorghum promoted a higher retention of ingested fluoride than do diets based on rice. Interventions to prevent fluorosis a). Changing of water source - Running surface water contains lower quantities of fluoride than ground water. b). Chemical treatment - Water can be chemically defluoridated in a water treatment plant. - The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur has developed a technique for renewing fluoride by chemical treatment. Ida Nalgonda technique. It involves the addition of two chemical (viz lime and alum) in sequence followed by flocculation, sedimentation and filteration. c). Other measures - Fluoride toothpastes are not recommended for children in areas of endemic fluorosis. - Fluoride supplements should not be prescribed for children who drink fluorinated water.",

        "question": "Herd Immunity is a feature of all of the following diseases except: September 2008",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Tetanus Herd immunity (or community immunity) describes a type of immunity that occurs when the vaccination of a poion of the population (or herd) provides protection to unprotected individuals. Herd immunity theory proposes that, in diseases passed from person to person, it is more difficult to maintain a chain of infection when large numbers of a population are immune. Vaccination acts as a so of firebreak or firewall in the spread of the disease, slowing or preventing fuher transmission of the disease to others. Unvaccinated individuals are indirectly protected by vaccinated individuals, as the latter will not contract and transmit the disease between infected and susceptible individuals. Hence, a public health policy of herd immunity may be used to reduce spread of an illness and provide a level of protection to a vulnerable, unvaccinated subgroup. Since only a small fraction of the population (or herd) can be left unvaccinated for this method to be effective, it is considered best left for those who cannot safely receive vaccines because of a medical condition such as an immune disorder or for organ transplant recipients. The propoion of immune individuals in a population above which a disease may no longer persist is the herd immunity threshold. Its value varies with the virulence of the disease, the efficacy of the vaccine, and the contact parameter for the population. No vaccine offers complete protection, but the spread of disease from person to person is much higher in those who remain unvaccinated. Herd immunity only applies to diseases that are contagious. It does not apply to diseases such as tetanus (which is infectious, but is not contagious), where the vaccine protects only the vaccinated person from disease. Herd immunity should not be confused with contact immunity, a related concept wherein a vaccinated individual can 'pass on' the vaccine to another individual through contact",

        "question": "Plaque is transmitted by: September 2005",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Flea Plague is a zoonotic disease circulating mainly among small animals and their fleas. The bacteria Yersinia pestis can also infect humans. It is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact, inhalation and rarely, ingestion of infective materials. Infected persons usually sta with \"flu-like\" symptoms after an incubation period of 3-7 days. Patients typically experience the sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea. Clinical plague infection manifests itself in three forms depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic. Bubonic form is the most common form of plague resulting from the bite of an infective flea. Plague bacillus enters the skin from the site of the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node. The lymph node then becomes inflamed because the plague bacteria, Yersinia pestis or Y. pestis, will replicate here in high numbers. The swollen lymph node is called a \"bubo\" which is very painful and can become suppurated as an open sore in advanced stage of infection; Septicaemic form of plague occurs when infection spreads directly through the bloodstream without evidence of a \"bubo\". More commonly advanced stages of bubonic plague will result in the presence of Y. pestis in the blood. Septicaemic plague may result from flea bites and from direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin. Pneumonic form of plague is the most virulent and least common form of plague. Typically, pneumonic form is due to a secondary spread from advanced infection of an initial bubonic form. Primary pneumonic plague results from inhalation of aerosolized infective droplets and can be transmitted from human to human without involvement of fleas or animals.",

The conditions under which a pregnancy can be terminated under the MTPAct. 1971: There are 5 conditions that have been identified in the Act: Medical - where continuation of the pregnancy might endanger the mother's life or cause grave injury to her physical or mental health. Eugenic - where there is substantial risk of the child being born with serious handicaps due to physical or mental abnormalities. Humanitarian - where pregnancy is the result of rape Socio-economic - where actual or reasonably foreseeable environments (whether social or economic could lead to risk of injury to the health of the mother). Failure of contraceptive devices - The anguish caused by an unwanted pregnancy resulting from a failure of any contraceptive device or method can be presumed to constitute a grave mental injury to the health of the mother. This condition is a unique feature of the Indian law and viually allows aboion on request, in view of the difficulty of proving that a pregnancy was not caused by failure of contraception. The written consent of the guardian is necessary before performing aboion in women under 18 years of age, and in lunatics even if they are older than 18 years. The person or persons who can perform aboion The Act provides safeguards to the mother by authorising only a Registered Medical Practitioner having experience in gynaecology and obstetrics to perform aboion where the length of pregnancy does not exceed 12 weeks. o However, where the pregnancy exceeds 12 weeks and is not more than 20 weeks, the opinion of two Ragistered o Medical Practitioners is necessary to terminate the pregnancy. Where aboion can be done The Act stipulates that no termination of pregnancy shall be made at any place other than a hospital established or maintained by Government or a place approved for the purpose of this Act by Government. Aboion services are provided in hospitals in strict confidence. The name of the aboion seeker is kept confidential, since aboion has been treated statutorily as a personal matter.",

The disease is caused by a virus belonging to the family flaviviridae, which also includes yellow fever and dengue fever. There are a variety of animals thought to be reservoir hosts for the disease, including porcupines, rats, squirrels, mice and shrews. The vector for disease transmission is Haemaphysalis spinigera, a forest tick. Humans contract infection from the bite of nymphs of the tick. The disease has a morbidity rate of 2-10%, and affects 100-500 people annually. The symptoms of the disease include a high fever with frontal headaches, followed by haemorrhagic symptoms, such as bleeding from the nasal cavity, throat, and gums, as well as gastrointestinal bleeding. An affected person may recover in two weeks time, but the convalescent period is typically very long, lasting for several months. There will be muscle aches and weakness during this period and the affected person is unable to engage in physical activities Prophylaxis by vaccination, as well as preventive measures like protective clothing, tick control, and mosquito control are advised.
