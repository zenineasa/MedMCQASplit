It consists in identifying those who have had RF and giving them one intramuscular injection of benzathine benzyl penicillin (1. 2 million units in adults and 600, 000 units in children) at intervals of 3 weeks. This must be continued for at least 5 years or until the child reaches 18 years whichever is later. For patients with carditis (mild mitral regurgitation or healed carditis) the treatment should continue for 10 years after the last attack, or at least until 25 years of age, which ever is longer. More severe valvular disease or post-valve surgery cases need life-long Treatment. This prevents streptococcal sore throat and therefore recurrence of RF and RHD.

Attack rate (Primary Attack Rate):-It is an incidence rate (usually expressed as a per cent), used only when the population is exposed to risk for a limited period of time such as during an epidemic.-It relates the number of cases in the population at risk and reflects the extent of the epidemic.

A population (say population A) with more young people would have low crude death rate than a population (population B) with more old people, thus giving an impression that population A is healthier than B. which may not be so. This confounding effect of age is removed by means of 'standardization'. \"Standardization of Death Rates. Adjusted or standardized rates: While comparison of death rates of two populations, 'crude death rate is not the right yardstick', as age- compositions are different. Age-adjustment or age-standardization removes confounding effect of different age structures. Standardization may be direct or indirect. Types of Standardized Death Rates. Direct standardization. Indirect standardization. Method:* Age-specific rates of the population (whose crude death rate is to be standardized) is applied on a standard population* Total expected deaths calculated* Total expected deaths divided by total standard population to yield standardized death rate. Feasibility:* Availability of age-specific death rates (ASDRQ)* Availability of population in each age group* Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) (Ref: Is simplest and most useful form)* Method: Calculate expected deaths, assuming that study group experiences the death rates of a standard population* Feasibility: Permits adjustment where age-specific rates are not available or are unstable because of small numbers* Examples of indirect StandardizationQ:- Standardized mortality ratio (SMR = Observed deaths/ Expected deaths x 100)- Life Table Analysis- Survival Analysis- Regression Analysis- Multivariate Analysis",

Infectious agent is dependent on reservoir for survival. From reservoir it can be transmitted to susceptible host. Thus a reservoir may act as a source of infection when a person acquires infection directly from a reservoir.# Source & reservoir are same - Tetanus spores survive in soil (reservoir) and a person acquires infection directly from soil (source). So, soil acts as reservoir as well as source.# Source & reservoir different ->>In typhoid, bacillus survives and multiplies inside human cases or carriers (act as reservoir), but immediate source of infection is feces or urine of patients, or contaminated food, water or milk (act as source).# So, source may or may not be a part of reservoir. In other words reservoir may or may not act as a source.* Reservoir may be: (i) Human, (ii) Animals or bird, or (iii) Non-living things. Human reservoir# Human reservoir is the most important source or reservoir of infection. They can be divided into -1. Cases* A case is a person which is having a particular disease. Cases may be of following types -i) Clinical case# Infected case who develops clinical manifestations. ii) Subclinical case (inapparent/covert/missed/abortive case)# Infected person is asymptomatic. Baring a few e. g. measles and chicken pox, sub-clinicalinfection occurs in most cases.# Important examples are rubella, mumps, polio, hepatitis A & B, influenza, diphtheria and Japanese encephalitis. iii) Latent infection# Infectious agent lie dormant in host without any activity, e. g. Herpes simplex, Brill-zinser diseaes, ankylostomiasis. 2. Carriers* A carrier is defined as \"an infected person or animal that harbours a specific infectious agent in the absence of clinical disease and serves as a potential source of infection\".* As a rule carriers are less infectious than cases, but epidemiologically they are more dangerous than cases because they escape recognition, and continuing as they do to live a normal life among the population or comunity, they readily infect the susceptible individuals over a wider area and longer period of time.* Carrier may be classified as follow. Temporary carrier* Temporary carriers shed the infectious agent for short period of time.* This category may include -1. Incubatory carriers: Measles, mumps, polio, pertussis (whooping cough), influenza, diphtheria, Hepatitis B. 2. Convalescent carriers: Typhoid, cholera, diphtheria, Pertussis (whooping cough), dysentery. 3. Healthy carriers: Polio, Cholera, meningococcal meningitis, Salmonellosis, diphtheria. Chronic carrier* Chornic carriers excrete the infectious agent for indefinite period.* Examples: Typhoid, hepatitis B, dysentery, malaria, gonorrhoea, cerebrospinal menigitis, Diphtheria. Note: Typhoid, hepatitis B and dysentery may have both temporary as well as chronic carriers.* A carrier who acquires infectious agent from other carrier is called 'paradoxical carrier'* A carrier who acquires infectious agent due to contact with patient is called 'contact carrier'.",

Groups to be compared are differentially susceptible to the outcome even before the experimental maneuver is performed.* Selection bias may be of following typesi) Surveillance! detection bias# It results from the use of a particular diagnostic technique or type of equipment. ii) Neyman survival bias (incidence-prevalence bias)# This type of bias is due to missing of fatal cases, mild cases or cases of shorter duration from the study. iii) Referrel bias (volunteer bias)# Volunteer or referral bias occurs because people who volunteer to participate in a study (or who are referred to it) are often different than non-volunteers/non referrel.# This bias usually favors the treatment group, as volunteers tend to be more motivated and concerned about there health. iv) Response bias# This type of bias occurs when those who respond to a survey differ in important ways from who do not respond. v) Berkesonian bias# Berksonian bias results from the greater probability of hospital admission for people with two or more disease than for people with one disease. So, it is also known as admission rate bias.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Systemic random sampling * Types of random sampling are: -i) Simple random sampling# It is also known as \"unrestricted random sampling\". Each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance. There is no stratification in similar groups. Thus, each individual has the same probability of being chosen.# Methods of simple random sampling are: -i) Lottery methodii) Random number tableiii) Computer technique.# It is suitable for small homogenous population and is used in clinical trials. It provides the greatest number of possible samples. ii) Systemic random sampling# In order to do systematic random sampling, the individuals in a population are arranged in a certain way (for example, alphabetically).# A random starting point is selected and then every nth (for example 10th or 15th) individual is selected for the sample.# That is, after arranging the individuals in certain pattern (e. g., alpabetically) a starting point is chosen at random, and choices thereafter at regular intervals. iii) Stratified random sampling# When sub-populations vary considerably, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently.# Stratification is the process of grouping members of the population into relative hemogenous subgroups before sampling.# The strata should be mutually exclusive, every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. Then systematic random sampling method is applied within each stratum.# Stratified random sampling is particularly useful where one is interested in analysing the data by a certain characteristic of the population, viz Hindus, Muslims, Christians, age group etc, - as we know these groups are not equally distributed in the population. iv) Cluster sampling# Cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when natural groupings are evident in a statistical population. In this technique, the total population is divided into these groups (or clusters) and a sample of groups is selected.# The characteristic feature is that selected groups act as samples (while in other types of random sampling individuals act as sample).# Cluster sampling is rapid, simple and economic (less expensive).# Sample size may vary according to study.# Cluster sampling is an example two-stage sampling.# There are chances of sampling error.# Cluster sampling is used in India to evaluate immunization coverage. WHO used 30 x 7 technique (total = 210 children) for cluster sampling in which there are 30 clusters, each containing 7 children who are 12-23 months old and are completely immunized for primary immunization (till measles vaccine at 9 month). v) Multistage random sampling# It is done in successive stages; each successive sampling unit is nested in the previous sampling unit. Advantage: Introduces flexibility in sampling.# For example, in large country surveys, states are chosen, then districts, then villages, then every 10th person in village as final sampling unit. vi) Multiphse random sampling# It is done in successive phase; part of information is obtained from whole sample and part from the sub-sample.# For example, in a TB survey, Mantourx test done in first phase, then X-ray done in all Mantoux positive, then sputum examined in all those with positive X-ray findings.",

Dr. Snow believed sewage dumped into the river or into cesspools near town wells could contaminate the water supply, leading to a rapid spread of disease. In August of 1854 Soho, a suburb of London, was hit hard by a terrible outbreak of cholera. Dr. Snows himself lived near Soho, and immediately went to work to prove his theory that contaminated water was the cause of the outbreak. \"Within 250 yards of the spot where Cambridge Street joins Broad Street there were upwards of 500 fatal attacks of cholera in 10 days, \" Dr. Snow wrote \"As soon as I became acquainted with the situation and extent of this irruption (sic) of cholera, I suspected some contamination of the water of the much-frequented street-pump in Broad Street. \" Dr. Snow worked around the clock to track down information from hospital and public records on when the outbreak began and whether the victims drank water from the Broad Street pump. Snow suspected that those who lived or worked near the pump were the most likely to use the pump and thus, contract cholera. His pioneering medical research paid off. By using a geographical grid to cha deaths from the outbreak and investigating each case to determine access to the pump water, Snow developed what he considered positive proof the pump was the source of the epidemic.",

        "question": "Prevalence is a:-",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e. Proportion [Ref. style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif\">Prevalence: It refers to all current cases existing at a given point in time. It's not a ratio (numerator is not part of denominator as in ratio). Prevalence is normally expressed as percentage e. g. 5% or number of cases per 10, 000 or 100, 000. When referenced as number of cases per X, it's a proportion. Long Reference: What is Prevalence? \"Prevalence\" is the proportion of a population who have (or had) a specific characteristic in a given time period - in medicine, typically an illness, a condition, or a risk factor such as depression or smoking. Prevalence is calculated if one has information on the characteristics of the entire population of interest (this is rare in medicine). Prevalence is estimated if one has information on samples of the population of interest. Prevalence is generally determined by: Randomly selecting a sample (smaller group) from the entire population, with the goal being for the sample to be representative of the population. For a simple representative sample, prevalence is the number of people in the sample with the characteristic of interest, divided by the total number of people in the sample. When samples (instead of entire populations) are used to generate estimates of prevalence, statistical 'weights' may be applied to adjust the sample characteristics to match up with the target population that they were selected to represent. For example, if the randomly selected sample ends up having 53% women and 47% men in it, but the target population the sample is supposed to represent has 51% women and 49% men, then statistical weights will be applied to bring the proportions of women and men in the sample in alignment with the portions of women and men in the target population. How is Prevalence Reported? Prevalence is usually expressed as a percentage (5%, or 5 people out of 100), or as the number of cases per 10, 000 or 100, 000 people, depending on how common the illness or risk factor is in the population. There are several ways to measure and report prevalence, which vary according to the timeframe for the estimate: Point prevalence is the proportion of a population that has the characteristic at a specific point in time. Period prevalence is the proportion of a population that has the characteristic at any point during a given time period of interest. \"Past 12 months\" is a commonly used timeframe. Lifetime prevalence is the proportion of a population who, at some point in life up to the time of assessment, has ever had the characteristic. How is Prevalence Different from Incidence? \"Incidence\" is a measure of the number of new cases of a characteristic (such as illness or risk factor) that arise in a population over a given period (e. g., a month, a year, etc.); whereas prevalence is the proportion of a population who have (or had) a specific characteristic in a given time period, regardless of when they first acquired the characteristic. In medicine and public health, one often studies incident (new) cases to help identify causes and prevent additional cases, particularly for infectious/communicable illness. What Else Do I Need to Know about Prevalence? A variety of surveys and data systems are used to produce prevalence estimates of mental disorders. Integrating information from multiple data sources can provide useful information about the mental health of the population of interest. When examining prevalence estimates generated in a variety of surveys, it is important to take into consideration survey methodology differences that may impact the prevalence estimates produced. That is, the goals and approaches for various sources of mental health data are often different, making direct comparisons between them difficult. Some methodological differences that may affect comparisons between studies include, but are not limited to: the populations covered; the timing of data collection; sample design; mode of data collection; instruments and surveys used; operational definitions; and, estimation methods.",

The term \"disease prevalence\" refers specifically to all current cases (old and new) existing at a given point in time, or over a period of time in a given population. oA broader definition of prevalence is as follows: \"the total number of all individuals who have an attribute or disease at a particular time (or during a particular period) divided by the population at risk of having the attribute or disease at this point in time or midway through the period\". o. Although referred to as a rate, prevalence rate is really a ratio. o. Prevalence is of two types:-Point prevalence-Period prevalenceo. Prevalence depends upon 2 factors, the Incidence and duration of Illness. Given the assumption that the population is stable, and incidence and duration are unchanging, the relationship between incidence and prevalence can be expressed as: P=Ix. DPrevalence = Incidence x mean durationo. Example (for a stable condition)o. Incidence = 10 cases per 1000 population per yearo. Mean duration of disease = 5 yearso. Prevalence =10x5 50 per 1000 populationo. Conversely, it is possible to derive incidence and durationoas follows: o. Incidence P/Do. Duration =P/Io. Uses of prevalence-Prevalence helps to estimate the magnitude of health/disease problems in the community, and identify potential high-risk populations-Prevalence rates are especially useful for administrative and planning purposes, E. g., Hospital beds, manpower needs, rehabilitation facilities, etc.",

Hence the year 1921 is rightly called the demographic divide or year of great divide.

For example a relative risk of 2 means that the incidence rate is 2 times higher in the exposed group as compared with unexposed - i. e., a 100% increase in risk.* On the other hand, attributable risk indicates the extent which is attributed by risk factor (exposure) to disease. For example attributable risk of 90% means 90 percent of disease among exposed is due to exposure to risk factor.* In simple words# Relative risk indicates the increased percentage of risk of developing a disease, if person is exposed to risk factor.# Attributable risk indicates the percentage of disease which is attributed by risk factor among the exposed.* Relative risk is a better index than is attributable risk for assessing the etiological role of a factor in disease.* On the other hand, attributable risk gives a better idea than does relative risk of the impact of successful preventive or public health programme might have in reducing the problem.

In England, it is the basis for the allocation of government money to the health regions of the country. The concept is That the regions with higher moality also have the higher morbidity, and should therefore receive propoionately higher funding to combat ill-health. Standard moality ratio is a ratio (usually expressed as a percentage) of the total number of deaths that occur in the study group to the number of deaths that would have been expected to occur if that study group had experienced the death rates of a standard population (or other reference population). In other words. SMR compares the moality in a study group (e. g., an occupational group) with the moality that the occupational group would have had if they had experienced national moality rates. In this method, the more stable rates of the larger population are applied to the smaller study group. It gives a measure of the likely excess risk of moality due to the occupation. SMR= Observed deaths /Expected deaths X l. OO The SMR has the advantage over the direct method of age adjustment in that it permits adjustment for age and other factors where age-specific rates are not available or are unstable because of small numbers. One needs to know only the number of persons in each age group in the study population and the age-specific rates of the national population (or other reference population).

These organisms have been passed repeatedly in the laboratory in tissue culture or chick embryos and have lost their capacity to induce full blown disease but retain their immunogenicity. In general, live vaccines are more potent immunizing agents than killed vaccines, reasons being:(i) live organisms multiply in the host and the resulting antigenic dose is larger than what is injected, (ii) live vaccines have all the major and minor antigenic components, (iii) live vaccines engage certain tissues of the body, as for example, intestinal mucosa by the oral polio vaccine# When two live vaccines are required they should be given either simultaneously at different sites or with an interval of at least 3 weeks.# In the case of live vaccines, immunization is generally achieved with a single dose.# The exception is polio vaccine which needs three or more doses to be given at spaced intervals to produce effective immunity.# Live vaccines usually produce a durable immunity, but not always as long as that of the natural infection.# Live vaccines must be properly stored to retain effectiveness.# Serious failures of measles and polio immunization have resulted from inadequate refrigeration prior to use.",
