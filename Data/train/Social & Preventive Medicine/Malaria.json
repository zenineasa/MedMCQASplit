This entails early diagnosis and prompt treatment with effective antimalaria! medicines. The WHO Guidelines for the treatment of malaria, which were first published in 2006, provide global, evidence-based recommendations on the case management of malaria, targeted mainly at policy-makers at country level, providing a framework for the developmentofspecific and more detailed national treatment protocols that take into account local antimalanal drug resistance patterns and health service capacity in the country. This second edition of the guidelines revisits the recommendations based on updated evidence. The same presentation format from the first edition has been mainly kept based on feedback from the end-users. A summary of the key recommendations provided in these guidelines is presented below. Box 1. Recommendations unchanged from the first edition of the Guidelines (2006). Treatment of uncomplicated R falciparum malaria. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the recommended treatments for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. The following ACTs are recommended: artemether plus lumefantrine, artesunate plus amodia- quine, artesunate plus mefloquine, and artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. The choice of ACT in a country or region will be based on the level of resistance of the partner medicine in the combination. Artemisinin and its derivatives should not be used as monotherapy. Second-line antimalarial treatment: alternative ACT known to be effective in the region; artesunate plus tetracycline or doxycycline or clindamycin; any of these combinations to be given for7 days; quinine plus tetracycline or doxycycline or clindamycin; any of these combinations should be given for 7 days. Box 2. Additional recommendations in the second edition of the Guidelines (2010). Treatment of uncomplicated R falciparum malaria. Artemisinin-based combination therapies should be used in preference to sulfadoxinepyrimethamine (SP) plus amodiaquine (AQ) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. ACTs should include at least 3 days of treatment with an artemisinin derivative. Strong recommendation, high quality-' evidence. Dihydroartemisinin plus piperaqutne (DHA+PPQ) is an option for the first-line treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria worldwide. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. Addition of a single dose primaquine (0. 75 mg/kg) to ACT treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria as an antigametocyte medicine, particularly as a component of pre-elimination or an elimination programme.",
