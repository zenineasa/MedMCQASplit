See APPENDIX-46 below for \"TYPES OF VACCINE Sc IMMUNIZATION\"MCV2 (2nd dose of Measles) can be delivered either through existing routine services or through measles catch-up immunization campaigns, the choice is determined by the strategy that would attain the highest levels of coverage. Government of India announced in May 2010 its decision to implement the National Technical Advisory Group on immunization (NTAGI) recommendation to introduce MCV2. As recommended by the NTAGI, the implementation strategy of MCV2 at the state level is determined by the underlying performance of the routine immunization (RI) program. In total, 14 states with measles coverage < 80% will introduce MCV2 through catchup vaccination campaigns. In the remaining 21 states with better performing routine immunization (>80% routine measles coverage) will introduce MCV2 for children aged 16- 24 months through the routine program. 1st dose: 9-12 months2nd dose: 16-24 months (If coverage > 80%), 9 months -10 years as catch up (if coverage <80%) APPENDIX - 46. Types of Vaccine. Type. Content. Examples. Killed vaccineskilled, but previously virulent, microorganisms that have been destroyed with chemicals or heat. Avian Flu vaccine; developed by Reverse Genetics techniques. Reverse genetics' is an approach to discovering the function of a gene by analyzing the phenotypic effects of specific gene sequences obtained by DNA sequencing. This investigative process proceeds in the opposite direction of so- called forward genetic screens of classical genetics. Simply put, while forward genetics seeks to find the genetic basis of a phenotype or trait, reverse genetics seeks to find what phenotypes arise as a result of particular genes.",
