Strength of associationo It implies how strongly exposure is associated with disease, o It is determined byiii) Dose-response relationship -With increasing level of exposure to the risk factor, on increasing ris in incidence is found. iv) Cessation of exposure (Reversibility) - Removal of possible cause reduces risk of disease. Consistency of associationo The association is consistent if the results are replicated when studies in different settings and by different methods. o For example, different studies in different settings have proved smoking as one of the cause for lung cancer - Smoking has consistent association with lung cancer. Coherence of associationo The causal association must be coherent (supported by) with relevant facts, o For example. The death rates due to lung cancer increasing more rapidly in females comparison to males. The relevant fact -This increasing rate is due to more recent adoption of cigarrete smoking by women.",
