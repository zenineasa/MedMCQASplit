The key to the success of this programme was the shift from supply to demand creation for health servicesQ, increased access to medicines, and community ownership. Roll Back Malaria* In Nigeria, a communication strategy for behavioural change was initiated using both the public and private sectors.* Messages on malaria case management, intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) wrere promoted using volunteers, social marketing of unit-dose, prepackaged antimalarial medicines and training of patent medicinedealers (BASICS II. 2004).* The channels used included interpersonal communication, traditional communication channels such as 'town criers' and local festivals, and social marketing through medicine packaging, radio spots and distribution of booklets to patent medicine dealers.* The strategy resulted in an increased knowledge of the role and benefits of ITNs in malaria prevention and an increased awareness of the danger signs of malaria and of the importance of seeking early treatment for febrile children through antimalarial medicines.* The key to the success of this programme was the shift from supply to demand creation for health services, increased access to medicines, and community ownership* The experience gained from such training programmes has demonstrated the need for training to address the following gaps in skills and knowledge, depending on the specific roles undertaken:- Knowledge and skills to recognize uncomplicated malaria, danger signs and when to refer the patient Knowledge and skills to manage malaria appropriately (recommended medications/dosages)- Awareness of the need for prompt and early treatment, and completion of the dose- Communication skills to counsel and offer health education on other aspects (e. g. ITNs. intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy)- Recording/reporting tasks- Drug storage* The highest level of political commitment by the national government is required to ensure that the cross-ministerial activities beyond the purview of the ministry of health required for the implementation of HMM are facilitated at the policy level.

Drug resistance foci are prevalent in the country but chloroquine is still the safe, effective and cheap antimalarial drug and is simple to be administered. The best approach in malaria treatment is diagnosis and treatment on the same day. b(Plasmodium falciparum predominant and drug resistance areas). Presumptive treatment of all suspected/clinical malaria cases: Day 1 Tab. Chloroquine - 10 mg/kg body weight (600 mg adult dose)+Tab. Primaquine - 0. 75 mg/kg body weight (45 mg adult dose). Day 2 Tab. Chloroquine - 10 mg/kg body weight (600 mg adult dose). Day 3 Tab. Chloroquine - 5 mg/kg body weight (300 mg adult dose).

Administration:- WHO programme on immunisation (EPI) and the national immunisation program in India recommend a primary course of 3 doses of vaccine with 1 month interval commencing at 6 weeks. It is recommended that a dose of OPV is required to be given to all children delivered in the hospital before discharge. Very impoant to complete vaccination before 6 months before most cases occur between 6 months- 3 years. Dose -2 drops Immunity:- prevents paralysis and intestinal reinfection. Thus limits virus transmission in community. The vaccine progeny excreted in faeces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts and susceptible contacts in community. Non immunised persons may therefore become immunised. This propey of OPV has been exploited in controlling epidemic. Advantages:- Antibodies quickly produced and therefore helps to control epidemic. Induces both humoral and intestinal immunity. Easy to administer. Complication:- Vaccine associated paralytic polio in recipients of vaccine and their contacts. Contraindications:- Immunocompromised. Malignancy. Leukemia. Storage-Requires to be stored and transpoed at sub zero temperature, unless stabilized. Problems with OPV:- 1. Instability of vaccine at high temperatures. 2. Frequent vaccine failures. 3. Small residual neurovirulence. OPV bicalent vaccine: Contains strains types 1 and 3. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 207}</p>",

WHO recommends the &; Danish 1331&; strain for vaccine production. Stable for several weeks at ambient temperature in a tropical climate and for upto 1 year if kept away from direct light and stored in a cool environment below 10 deg celcius. Vaccine must be protected from light ( wrapped up in a double layer of red/ black cloth). Normal saline is recommended as diluent for reconstituting the vaccine as distilled water may cause irritation. Reconstituted vaccine may be used within 3 hours. Dosage-0. 1 mg in 0. 1 ml volume. The dose of newborn below 4 weeks is 0. 05 ml. Administered intradermally using tuberculin syringe. Injected slightly above the inseion of left deltoid. If injected too high / too low adjacent lymph nodes may become involved and tender. The vaccine must not be contaminated with an antiseptic/detergent. If alcohol is used to swab the skin, it must be allowed to evaporate before the vaccine is given. Phenomenon after vaccination:/ 2-3 weeks after a correct intradermal injection of a potent vaccine, a papule develops at the site of vaccination. It increases slowly in size and reaches a a diameter of about 4-8 mm in 5 weeks. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow ulcer but usually seen covered by a crust. Healing occurs within 6-12weeks leaving a permanent, tiny, round scar (4-8 mm in diameter). This is a normal reaction. Normally the individual become mantoux postive after 8 weeks has elapsed. Adverse reactions: prolonged severe ulceration at the site of vaccination, suppurative lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis and disseminated BCG infection. Contraindications: BCG should not be given to patients with generalised eczema, infective dermatosis, hypogammaglobulinemia, those with history of deficient immunity, patients under immunosuppressive treatment and in pregnancy. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 196}</p>",

Uses of Lepromin testto evaluate the immune status (cell mediated immunity) of leprosy patientsin classifying the diseaseto estimate the prognosis of leprosy patients (Lepromin test is usually strongly positive in the typical tuberculoid cases and the positivity getting weaker as one passes through the spectrum to the lepromatous end. The typical lepromatous cases are lepromin negative, indicating a failure of CMI. The lepromin negative individuals are at a higher risk of developing progressive multibacillary leprosy, but those who are lepromin positive, either escape the clinical disease or develop paucibacillary disease). Procedure and Inference. This test is performed by injecting intradermally 0. 1 ml of lepromin into the inner aspect of the forearm. Reaction is read at 48 hrs and 21 days. Two types of positive reactions have been described. Early Reaction or Fernandez reactionthis appears as an area of redness and induration at the site of inoculationit develops within 24 to 48 hrs and disappears after 3 to 4 days. the reading is taken at 48 hrs, and if the area of redness is more than 10 mm, the test is considered positive. the early reaction has been described as delayed hypersensitivity reaction to \"soluble\" constituents of the leprosy bacilli. Late Reaction or Mitsuda reactionthis reaction develops late, becoming apparent in 7-10 days following the infection and reaches peak in 3 or 4 weeks. A nodule develops at the site of inoculation. the reading is taken at 21 days and if the nodule is more than 5 mm in diameter, the reaction is said to be positive. the late reaction is induced by the bacillary component of the antigen. It indicates cell mediated immunity. The early positive reaction indicates whether or not a person has been previously sensitized by exposure to an infection by leprosy bacilli. It is thus more superior to late reaction. The early reaction corresponds to the Mantoux reaction in tuberculosis. Also Know: In the first 6 months of life, most children are lepromin negative; gradually with increasing age more and more persons become positive. BCG vaccination can convert lepra reactions from negative to positive in large no. of individuals.",

        "exp": "Slide repoing The number of bacilli seen in a smear reflects disease severity and patient infectivity. Therefore, it is impoant to record the number of bacilli seen on each smear. Laboratory technicians should examine both the sputum samples from each TB suspect. They must record the result of each sputum sample with the laboratory reference number in the laboratory register and on the sputum request form. Results as indicated above are made available to the clinician who can then categorize the patient. It is advised that the smear examined by one microscopist should not exceed 20 per day as visual fatigue leads to a deterioration of reading quality. One positive specimen out of the two is enough to declare a patient as smear positive TB. Smear positive TB is fuher classified as new or retreatment cases, based on their previous treatment history, and appropriate therapy is prescribed. Patients in whom both specimens are smear negative should be prescribed symptomatic treatment and broad-spectrum antibiotic for 10-14 days. In such casesantibiotics such as fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, etc.), rifampicin or streptomycin, which are active against TB, should not be used. Most patients are likely to improve with antibiotics if they are not suffering from TB. If the symptoms persist after a course of broad-spectrum antibiotic, repeat sputum smear examination (2 samples) must be done for such patients. If one or more smears are positive, the patient is diagnosed as having smear-positive pulmonary TB. If none of the repeat sputum specimen is positive, a chest X-ray is taken, and if findings of the X-ray are consistent with pulmonary TB, the patient is diagnosed as a case of sputum-negative pulmonary TB. Sputum smear microscopy for tubercle bacilli is positive when there are at least 10, 000 organisms present per ml of sputum. The sputum smear positivity rate in TB/HIV patient depends on the degree of immunocompromise. If the degree of immunocompromise is mild, the likelihood of positive sputum smear is similar to HIV negative patient. If immunocompromise is severe, the likelihood of positive sputum smear is decreased because of decreased inflammation in lungs Ref: Park 23rd edition Pgno: 183",

Final vaccine mixture contains 40 units of type1, 8 units of type 2, and 32 units of type3. Administration- intramuscular injection or subcutaneous. Should be refrigerated to ensure no loss of potency. Freezing avoided. Either administered alone or in combination with other vaccine antigens including diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell or acellular peussis, Hepatitis B, or Haemophilus influenza type b. Primary/initial course consists of 4 inoculation: first 3doses given at an interval of 1-2 months and 4 th dose 6-12 months after 3 rd dose. First dose given when the infant is 6 weeks old. Additional doses recommended prior to school entry and then every 5 yrs until the age of 18. Alternatively one/two doses of OPV can be safely given as boosters after an initial course of immunisation with inactivated vaccine. Immunity:- induces circulating humoral antibodies(IgM, IgG, IgA). Doesn&; t induce intestinal or local immunity. The circulating antibodies protect the individual against paralytic polio, but do not prevent reinfection of gut by wild viruses. In case of epidemic, IPV is unsustainable because immunity is not rapidly achieved as more than one dose required to induce immunity and injections are to be avoided during epidemic as they are likely to precipitate paralysis. Advantages:- it doesn&; t contain living virus, so safe to administer: 1. To persons with immunodeficiency diseases. 2. To persons undergoing coicosteroid and radiation therapy. 3. To those over 50 years who are receiving vaccine for first time. 4. During pregnancy. 5. IPV is an alternative to OPV for immunisation of children with HIV infection.

        "exp": "ORSThe aim of oral rehydration therapy is to prevent dehydration and reduce moality. Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. The inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of the direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 m.

It is a zoonotic disease infecting mainly animals and incidentally man.* In south, epidemics have occured in Karnataka, Andhra pradesh, Tamil-Nadu and Kerala. Now Gorakhpur district of U. P. contributes largest number of cases.* Main vector of JE transmission is culex mosquito (culex tritaeniorhynchus), a zoophilic rural mosquito that breeds in rice paddy fields, shallow ditches and pools. Other important vector species are culex vishnuii and culex gelidus.* Pigs are amplifier host i. e., infected pigs do not manifest overt symptoms but circulate the virus so that mosquito get infected and can transmit virus to man. Horses are the only domestic animals showing symptoms of JE. Man is an 'incidental dead-end host\\ there is no man-to-man transmission. 'Cattle and buffaloes' act as mosquito attractants, i. e. infected but are not the natural hosts. Herons (birds) are the reservoir hosts.* There are two natural cycles of JE virus:* i) Pig - mosquito - pig* ii) Ardeid bird - mosquito - Ardeid bird.* Most of the cases are subclinical, ratio of overt disease to inappearent infection varies 1: 1000, i. e., cases show tip of iceberg. For clinical cases incubation period is 5-15 days. The disease passes through sequential stages of prodrome, acute encephalitis, and late stage with sequelae. There is no rash at the site of mosquito bite.* Case fatality rate is 20-40%. The endemicity of cases is 1-2 case per village.* The vast majoirty of cases (about 85%) occur among children < 15 years of age. But JE is infrequent in infancy.",

Administration:- WHO programme on immunisation (EPI) and the national immunisation program in India recommend a primary course of 3 doses of vaccine with 1 month interval commencing at 6 weeks. It is recommended that a dose of OPV is required to be given to all children delivered in the hospital before discharge. Very impoant to complete vaccination before 6 months before most cases occur between 6 months- 3 years. Dose -2 drops Immunity:- prevents paralysis and intestinal reinfection. Thus limits virus transmission in community. The vaccine progeny excreted in faeces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts and susceptible contacts in community. Non immunised persons may therefore become immunised. This propey of OPV has been exploited in controlling epidemic. Advantages:- Antibodies quickly produced and therefore helps to control epidemic. Induces both humoral and intestinal immunity. Easy to administer. Complication:- Vaccine associated paralytic polio in recipients of vaccine and their contacts. Contraindications:- Immunocompromised. Malignancy. Leukemia. Storage-Requires to be stored and transpoed at sub zero temperature, unless stabilized. Problems with OPV:- 1. Instability of vaccine at high temperatures. 2. Frequent vaccine failures. 3. Small residual neurovirulence.

It is effectively made non-infectious by treatment with rifampicin for 3 weeks and by dapsone for 90 days. Local application of rifampicin (drops or spray) may destroy all the bacilli with in 8 days. Chemotherapy for leprosy- WHO recommendations. MULTIBACILLARY LEPROSY12 months to he completed within 18 months Rifampicin - 600mg once monthly under supervision. Clofazimine - 300 mg once monthly under supervision - 50 mg daily self administered Dapsone 100 - mg daily self administered.

PAUCIBACILLARY LEPROSY SINGLE LESION -* Ofloxacin 400 mg (Single dose)* Rifampicin 600 mg* Minocycline l. OOmg. Anti-leprotic drugs1) RIFAMPICIN -It is bactericidal to M. leprae and rapidly renders leprosy patients non contagious. Up to 99. 99% M. leprae are killed in 3-7 days. MOA- Rifampicin binds to the bacterial DNA-dependent RN A polymerase and thereby inhibits RNA synthesis. Other indications include tuberculosis, prophylaxis of meningococ-cal and H. influenza meningitis and carrier state, combined with doxy-cycline in brucellosis, 2nd/3rd choice drug in MRSA, diphtheroids and legionella. Adverse effects. Imparts a harmless orange color to urine, sweat, tears, and contact lenses. Rashes, thrombocytopenia and nephritis. Cholestatic jaundice and occasionally hepatitis. Rifampicin commonly causes light-chain proteinuria. If administered less often than twice weekly, rifampicin causes a flu-like syndrome characterized by fever, chills, myalgia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia and sometimes is associated with acute tubu-lar necrosis. Rifampicin strongly induces most Cytochrome P450 isoforms. 2) DAPSONE (DPS): Dapsone (di amino di phenyl sulfone) like the sulfonamides inhibits folate synthesis. It is leprostatic at low concentrations and at relatively higher con-centrations arrests the growth of many other bacteria sensitive to sulfonamides. Other uses -1) In combination with pyrimethamine, Dapsone is used for treatment of chloroquine-resistant malaria. 2) It is used to prevent and treat Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in AIDS patients. Adverse effects: Many patients develop some hemolysis, particularly if they have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Methemoglobinemia is common. Gastrointestinal intolerance, fever, pruritus and various rashes also occur. Allergic rashes, fixed drug eruption hypermelanosis, photo toxicity, and exfoliative dermatitis are the various cutaneous reactions seen. CLOFAZIMINEIt is a dye with leprostatic and anti-inflammatory properties. Its mechanism of action is unknown but may involve DNA binding. Adverse effects. Skin- The most prominent untoward effect is skin discoloration ranging from red-brown to nearly black. Dryness of skin and itching is also seen. Acneiform eruptions and photoxicity have been noted. GIT- Gastrointestinal intolerance occurs occasionally. Other antibiotics used are ofloxacin, minocycline and clarithromycin",

Inadvertent immunization of individuals who are already immune is not associated with significant adverse reactions.# Mumps vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women, for patients receiving glucocorticoids, or for other immunocompromised hosts.# However, children with HIV infection who are not severely immunocompromised can safely be immunized against mumps; MMR vaccine is usually used for this purpose.# Occasionally, febrile reactions and parotitis have been reported soon after mumps vaccination.

Administration:- WHO programme on immunisation (EPI) and the national immunisation program in India recommend a primary course of 3 doses of vaccine with 1 month interval commencing at 6 weeks. It is recommended that a dose of OPV is required to be given to all children delivered in the hospital before discharge. Very impoant to complete vaccination before 6 months before most cases occur between 6 months- 3 years. Dose -2 drops Immunity:- prevents paralysis and intestinal reinfection. Thus limits virus transmission in community. The vaccine progeny excreted in faeces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts and susceptible contacts in community. Non immunised persons may therefore become immunised. This propey of OPV has been exploited in controlling epidemic. Advantages:- Antibodies quickly produced and therefore helps to control epidemic. Induces both humoral and intestinal immunity. Easy to administer. Complication:- Vaccine associated paralytic polio in recipients of vaccine and their contacts. Contraindications:- Immunocompromised. Malignancy. Leukemia. Storage-Requires to be stored and transpoed at sub zero temperature, unless stabilized. Problems with OPV:- 1. Instability of vaccine at high temperatures. 2. Frequent vaccine failures. 3. Small residual neurovirulence. OPV bicalent vaccine: Contains strains types 1 and 3. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 207}</p>",

Roll Back Malaria* In Nigeria, a communication strategy for behavioural change was initiated using both the public and private sectors.* Messages on malaria case management, intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) wrere promoted using volunteers, social marketing of unit-dose, prepackaged antimalarial medicines and training of patent medicinedealers (BASICS II. 2004).* The channels used included interpersonal communication, traditional communication channels such as 'town criers' and local festivals, and social marketing through medicine packaging, radio spots and distribution of booklets to patent medicine dealers.* The strategy resulted in an increased knowledge of the role and benefits of ITNs in malaria prevention and an increased awareness of the danger signs of malaria and of the importance of seeking early treatment for febrile children through antimalarial medicines.* The key to the success of this programme was the shift from supply to demand creation for health services, increased access to medicines, and community ownership* The experience gained from such training programmes has demonstrated the need for training to address the following gaps in skills and knowledge, depending on the specific roles undertaken:- Knowledge and skills to recognize uncomplicated malaria, danger signs and when to refer the patient Knowledge and skills to manage malaria appropriately (recommended medications/dosages)- Awareness of the need for prompt and early treatment, and completion of the dose- Communication skills to counsel and offer health education on other aspects (e. g. ITNs. intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy)- Recording/reporting tasks- Drug storage* The highest level of political commitment by the national government is required to ensure that the cross-ministerial activities beyond the purview of the ministry of health required for the implementation of HMM are facilitated at the policy level.

Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution.

Uses of Lepromin testto evaluate the immune status (cell mediated immunity) of leprosy patientsin classifying the diseaseto estimate the prognosis of leprosy patients. Procedure and Inference. This test is performed by injecting intradermally 0. 1 ml of lepromin into the inner aspect of the forearm. Reaction is read at 48 hrs and 21 days. Two types of positive reactions have been described. Early Reaction or Fernandez reactionthis appears as an area of redness and induration at the site of inoculationit develops within 24 to 48 hrs and disappears after 3 to 4 days. the reading is taken at 48 hrs, and if the area of redness is more than 10 mm, the test is considered positive. Late Reaction or Mitsuda reactionthis reaction develops late, becoming apparent in 7-10 days following the infection and reaches peak in 3 or 4 weeks. A nodule develops at the site of inoculation. the reading is taken at 21 days and if the nodule is more than 5 mm in diameter, the reaction is said to be positive. The early reaction is induced by soluble constituents of the leprosy bacilli; and the late reaction by the bacillary component of the antigen. The early positive reaction indicates whether or not a person has been previously sensitized by exposure to an infection by leprosy bacilli. It is thus more superior to late reaction. The early reaction corresponds to the Mantoux reaction in tuberculosis. In the first 6 months of life, most children are lepromin negative; gradually with increasing age more and more persons become positive. BCG vaccination can convert lepra reactions from negative to positive in large no. of individuals.",

Smear positive tuberculosis - At least one initial sputum smears positive for AFB or one AFB positive. Smear negative tuberculosis - At least two negative smears, but tuberculosis suggestive symptoms and X-ray abnormalities or positive culture. Adherence - Person takes appropriate drug regimen for required time (also known as compliance). New case - A patient with sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis who has never had treatment for tuberculosis or has taken anti - tuberculosis drugs for less than 4 weeks. Relapse - A patient who returns smear positive having previously been treated for tuberculosis and declared cured after the completion of his treatment. Failure case - A patient who was initially smear positive, who began treatment and who remained or became mear positive again at five months or later during the course of treatment. Return after default - A patient who returns sputum smear positive, after having left treatment for at least two months. Transfer in - A patient recorded in another administrative area register and transferred into another area to continue treatment (treatment results should be reported to the district where the patient was initially registered). Transfer out - A patient who has been transferred to another area register and treatment results are not known. Cured - Initially smear positive patient who completed treatment and had negative smear result on at least two occasions (one at treatment completion). Treatment completed - Initially smear negative patient who received full course of treatment, or smear positive who completed treatment, with negative smear at the end of initial phase, but no or only one negative smear during continuation and none at treatment end. Cohort - A group of patients in whom TB has been diagnosed, and who were registered for treatment during a specified time period (e. g. the cohort of new smear-positive cases registered in the calender year 2003). This group forms the denominator for calculating treatment outcomes. The sum of the treatment outcomes, plus any case for which no outcome is recorded (eg. still on treatment) should equal the number of cases registered.

SEVERE PNEUMONIA Most impoant sign to consider when deciding if the child has pneumonia are the RR and chest indrawing. A child with chest indrawing may not have fast breathing if the child becomes exhausted. Then the breathing slows down. Un such cases chest indrawing may be the only sign in a child with severe pneumonia. Other signs: 1. Nasal flare 2. Grunting 3. Cyanosis 4. Wheezing Treatment:- Refer urgently to hospital. Give first dose antibiotics. Treat fever and wheeze if present. PMEUMONIA:- 1. Fast breathing 2. No chest indrawing Treatment:- Advice mother to give home care. Give an antibiotic. Treat fever and wheeze if present. Advice mother to return eith child in 2 days for reassessment, or earlier if child gets worse. No pneumonia:- 1. Simple cough or cold. Treatment:- Assess and treat ear problems or sore throat. Assess and treat other problems. Advice mother to give home care. Treat fever and wheeze if present. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 170}</p>",

Clinically characterised by insidious onset with mild fever and an irritating cough, gradually becoming paroxysmal with the characteristic whoop often with cyanosis and vomiting. Also known as \"Hundred day cough\". AGENT FACTORS:- 1. Agent-B. peussis. Small percentage of case are caused by B. parapeussis, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus. 2. Source of infection- B. peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&; t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&; t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B. parapeussis. Mode of transmission:- Mainly by droplet infection and direct contact. Each time the patient coughs, sneezes or talks, the bacilli are sprayed into the air. The role of fomites in the spread of disease appears to be very small, unless they are freshly contaminated.

        "question": "Leprosy is not yet eradicated because",
        "exp": "Ans is 'a' i. e. No effective vaccine Both \"No Effective Vaccine\" and \"Long incubation period\" are the reason behind not being able to fully control Leprosy. But when it comes to eradication, \"No Effective Vaccine\" is correct answer because only disease eradicated (small pox) was because of effective vaccine. About leprosy Park writes- \"Although significant progress has been made in controlling the disease and reducing the disease burden, much remains to be done in order to sustain the gains and further reduce the impact of the disease... One of the long-term needs is to develop reliable diagnostic tests for early diagnosis and an effective vaccine for the prevention of leprosy. \"The only disease which has been eradicated till now is smallpox. There were many advantageous features of the disease coupled with a highly effective, heat stable vaccine which led to its eradication. The other disease which is a very potential candidate for eradication is Polio. It does not have advantageous features like those possessed by Small pox, still it has a very effective vaccine. Small pox was eradicated and Polio is likely to be eradicated because of the massive global immunization programs launched by WHO. This suggests that most probable reason for non-eradication of leprosy could be absence of an effective vaccine. Other reasons which are also culprits are - long incubation period, highly infectious, large number of infective subclinical cases, difficult to diagnose and animal reservoir. Various definitions: Control: The reduction of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity or mortality to a locally acceptable level as a result of deliberate efforts; continued intervention measures are required to maintain the reduction. Example: diarrhoeal diseases. Elimination: Reduction to zero of the incidence of a specified disease in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate efforts; continued intervention measures are required. Example: neonatal tetanus, measles, poliomyelitis. Eradication: Permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by a specific agent as a result of deliberate efforts; intervention measures are no longer needed. Example: smallpox. Extinction: The specific infectious agent no longer exists in nature or in the laboratory. Example: none. Factors associated with potential for eradication of a communicable disease: There are many factors but the three factors considered to be of primary importance are: An effective intervention is available to interrupt transmission of the agent; Practical diagnostic tools with sufficient sensitivity and specificity are available to detect levels of infection that can lead to transmission; and. Humans are essential for the life-cycle of the agent, which has no other vertebrate reservoir and does not amplify in the environment. Factors Associated with Potential for Eradication of a Communicable Disease Factors Associated with the Disease. Ease of diagnosis and treatment Low prevalence of subclinical disease High disease burden and economic impact Immunity is long term or lifelong Disease cannot be reactivated Disease has predictable seasonality. Factors Associated with the Etiologic Agent. Lack of an animal reservoir or vector. Only one causative agent or serotype. Short incubation period. Factors Associated with the Host or Target Population. Correlates or protection can be demonstrated. Host cannot be reinfected with the agent. Host cannot shed the organism once infection is resolved. Public acceptance of the vaccine and other control measures is high. Factors Associated with the Vaccine. Can confer long-lasting protection in a few injections. Minimal handling and storage requirements (e. g., cold chain). Simple administration. Can be administered simultaneously with other vaccines or adapted to schedules and timing of the national childhood immunization programs. Few short- or long-term adverse effects. Low cost to produce and purchase vaccine Epidemiological factors which led to the eradication of smallpox are: No known animal reservoir. No long-term carrier of the virus. Life-long immunity, after recovery from the disease. The detection of the cases was relatively simple as the rashes were characteristic. Persons with subclinical infection did not transmit the disease. Highly effective, heat stable vaccine, easily administrable and provides long term protection. International cooperation",

Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 m. Osm/l improved the efficacy of ORS regimen for children with acute non cholera diarrhoea.

The term \"Zoonosis\" has been further amplified as follows: Anthropozoonoses. Infections transmitted to man from vertebrate animals, e. g., rabies, plague, anthrax, hydatid disease. Zooanthroponoses. Infections transmitted from man to vertebrate animals e. g., human tuberculosis in cattle. Amphixenosis. Infections maintained in both man and lower vertebrate animals that may be transmitted in either direction e. g., T. cruzi and S. japonicum. About other options: Exotic--Diseases which are imported into a country in which they do not occur otherwise e. g. rabies in UK, epidemic polyarthritis in visitors of Fizi, due to Ross River virus. Epizootic--an outbreak (epidemic) of disease in an animal population often with an implication that it may also affect human populations. Examples include anthrax, brucellosis, rabies, influenza.

Because peripheral nerve trunks are often involved, unless reactions are promptly and adequately treated, such episodes can result in permanent deformities. Type 1 (Reversal Reaction) 1. Delayed hypersensitivity. 2. Occurs in both PB and MB cases in unstable types like BT. BB. BL. 3. Skin lesions suddenly become reddish, swollen, warm, painful, and tender. New lesions may appear. 4. Nerves close to skin may be enlarged, tender. and painful (neuritis) with loss of its functions (loss of sensation and muscle weakness) which may appear suddenly. 5. Other organs - not affected. 6. General symptoms - not common. Treatment of Lepra reactions (moderate to severe cases) It includes bed rest, rest to affected nerves by splint, analgesics, prednisolone. Each case of reaction should be assessed for his/her fitness to put on prednisolone as per check list given above Prednisolone tablets issued must be entered in 'Prednisolone card'. Tapering of prednisolone may be done according to its response. Patient must be instructed on salt restriction, no prednisolone intake on empty stomach and repoing adverse effects/symptoms immediately. Adding Clofazimine for Type II reaction may be extremely useful for reducing or withdrawing coicosteroids in patients who have become dependent on them. Total duration of Clofazimine therapy should not exceed 12 months. If a patient develops lepra reaction during the treatment, do not stop MDT (rather complete the course of MDT). Lepra reactions, which occur after completion of treatment, should also be managed as mentioned earlier. MDT should not be restaed for such cases. Response to treatment should be monitored and assessed, including check on adverse effects of prednisolone. Before staing the steroid treatment, the patient should be asked questions about epigestric pain and diarrhoea, with or without blood and or mucous; and examined for fungal infection, scabies, and worm infestations, as all these conditions may be made worse by steroids. Treatment of all these conditions can be staed at the same time as steroids are staed. Before staing the steroid treatment the patient should be explained the reason for treatment; the duration of the treatment; impoance of taking daily dose and that the treatment should not be stopped suddenly (the dosage is decreased gradually) and impoance of completing the full course of treatment; and possible side-effects.

In most chronic carriers, the organism persists in gall bladder and in biliary tract. Source of infection- faeces and urine of cases/carriers. Age group involved mostly is 5-19 yrs old. Males affected more than females. Incubation period- 10-14 days. Mode of transmission: faecal oral route/ urine oral routes. Treatment of carriers:- Intensive course of ampicillin/ amoxycillin (4-6g/day) together with probenecid for 6 weeks. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 235}</p>",

It is recommended that a dose of OPV is required to be given to all children delivered in the hospital before discharge. Very impoant to complete vaccination before 6 months before most cases occur between 6 months- 3 years. Dose -2 drops Immunity:- prevents paralysis and intestinal reinfection. Thus limits virus transmission in community. The vaccine progeny excreted in faeces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts and susceptible contacts in community. Non immunised persons may therefore become immunised. This propey of OPV has been exploited in controlling epidemic. Advantages:- Antibodies quickly produced and therefore helps to control epidemic. Induces both humoral and intestinal immunity. Easy to administer. Complication:- Vaccine associated paralytic polio in recipients of vaccine and their contacts. Contraindications:- Immunocompromised. Malignancy. Leukemia. Storage-Requires to be stored and transpoed at sub zero temperature, unless stabilized. Problems with OPV:- 1. Instability of vaccine at high temperatures. 2. Frequent vaccine failures. 3. Small residual neurovirulence.

WHO recommends the &; Danish 1331&; strain for vaccine production. Stable for several weeks at ambient temperature in a tropical climate and for upto 1 year if kept away from direct light and stored in a cool environment below 10 deg celcius. Vaccine must be protected from light ( wrapped up in a double layer of red/ black cloth). Normal saline is recommended as diluent for reconstituting the vaccine as distilled water may cause irritation. Reconstituted vaccine may be used within 3 hours. Dosage-0. 1 mg in 0. 1 ml volume. The dose of newborn below 4 weeks is 0. 05 ml. Afministered intradermally using tuberculin syringe. Injected slightly above the inseion of left deltoid. If injected too high / too low adjacent lymph nodes may become involved and tender. The vaccine must not be contaminated with an antiseptic/detergent. If alcohol is used to swab the skin, it must be allowed to evaporate before the vaccine is given. Phenomenon after vaccination:/ 2-3 weeks after a correct intradermal injection of a potent vaccine, a papule develops at the site of vaccination. It increases slowly in size and reaches a a diameter of about 4-8 mm in 5 weeks. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow ulcer but usually seen covered by a crust. Healing occurs within 6-12weeks leaving a permanent, tiny, round scar (4-8 mm in diameter). This is a normal reaction. Normally the individual become mantoux postive after 8 weeks has elapsed. Adverse reactions: prolonged severe ulceration at the site of vaccination, suppurative lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis and disseminated BCG infection. Contraindications: BCG should not be given to patients with generalised eczema, infective dermatosis, hypogammaglobulinemia, those with history of deficient immunity, patients under immunosuppressive treatment and in pregnancy. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 196}</p>",
