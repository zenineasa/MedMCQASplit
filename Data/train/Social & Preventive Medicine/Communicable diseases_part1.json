It is recommended that a dose of OPV is required to be given to all children delivered in the hospital before discharge. Very impoant to complete vaccination before 6 months before most cases occur between 6 months- 3 years. Dose -2 drops Immunity:- prevents paralysis and intestinal reinfection. Thus limits virus transmission in community . The vaccine progeny excreted in faeces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts and susceptible contacts in community. Non immunised persons may therefore become immunised. This propey of OPV has been exploited in controlling epidemic . Advantages:- Antibodies quickly produced and therefore helps to control epidemic. Induces both humoral and intestinal immunity. Easy to administer. Complication:- Vaccine associated paralytic polio in recipients of vaccine and their contacts . Contraindications:- Immunocompromised. Malignancy . Leukemia. Storage-Requires to be stored and transpoed at sub zero temperature,unless stabilized. Problems with OPV:- 1. Instability of vaccine at high temperatures. 2. Frequent vaccine failures. 3. Small residual neurovirulence.

WHO recommends the &;Danish 1331&; strain for vaccine production. Stable for several weeks at ambient temperature in a tropical climate and for upto 1 year if kept away from direct light and stored in a cool environment below 10 deg celcius. Vaccine must be protected from light ( wrapped up in a double layer of red/ black cloth). Normal saline is recommended as diluent for reconstituting the vaccine as distilled water may cause irritation. Reconstituted vaccine may be used within 3 hours. Dosage-0.1 mg in 0.1 ml volume. The dose of newborn below 4 weeks is 0.05 ml. Administered intradermally using tuberculin syringe. Injected slightly above the inseion of left deltoid. If injected too high / too low adjacent lymph nodes may become involved and tender. The vaccine must not be contaminated with an antiseptic/detergent. If alcohol is used to swab the skin , it must be allowed to evaporate before the vaccine is given. Phenomenon after vaccination:/ 2-3 weeks after a correct intradermal injection of a potent vaccine, a papule develops at the site of vaccination. It increases slowly in size and reaches a a diameter of about 4-8 mm in 5 weeks. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow ulcer but usually seen covered by a crust. Healing occurs within 6-12weeks leaving a permanent,tiny, round scar (4-8 mm in diameter).This is a normal reaction. Normally the individual become mantoux postive after 8 weeks has elapsed. Adverse reactions: prolonged severe ulceration at the site of vaccination, suppurative lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis and disseminated BCG infection. Contraindications: BCG should not be given to patients with generalised eczema, infective dermatosis, hypogammaglobulinemia , those with history of deficient immunity, patients under immunosuppressive treatment and in pregnancy. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.196}</p>",

        "exp": "Slide repoing The number of bacilli seen in a smear reflects disease severity and patient infectivity. Therefore, it is impoant to record the number of bacilli seen on each smear. Laboratory technicians should examine both the sputum samples from each TB suspect. They must record the result of each sputum sample with the laboratory reference number in the laboratory register and on the sputum request form. Results as indicated above are made available to the clinician who can then categorize the patient. It is advised that the smear examined by one microscopist should not exceed 20 per day as visual fatigue leads to a deterioration of reading quality. One positive specimen out of the two is enough to declare a patient as smear positive TB. Smear positive TB is fuher classified as new or retreatment cases, based on their previous treatment history, and appropriate therapy is prescribed. Patients in whom both specimens are smear negative should be prescribed symptomatic treatment and broad-spectrum antibiotic for 10-14 days. In such casesantibiotics such as fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, etc.), rifampicin or streptomycin, which are active against TB, should not be used. Most patients are likely to improve with antibiotics if they are not suffering from TB. If the symptoms persist after a course of broad-spectrum antibiotic, repeat sputum smear examination (2 samples) must be done for such patients. If one or more smears are positive, the patient is diagnosed as having smear-positive pulmonary TB. If none of the repeat sputum specimen is positive, a chest X-ray is taken, and if findings of the X-ray are consistent with pulmonary TB, the patient is diagnosed as a case of sputum-negative pulmonary TB. Sputum smear microscopy for tubercle bacilli is positive when there are at least 10,000 organisms present per ml of sputum. The sputum smear positivity rate in TB/HIV patient depends on the degree of immunocompromise. If the degree of immunocompromise is mild, the likelihood of positive sputum smear is similar to HIV negative patient. If immunocompromise is severe, the likelihood of positive sputum smear is decreased because of decreased inflammation in lungs Ref : Park 23rd edition Pgno : 183",

Should be refrigerated to ensure no loss of potency. Freezing avoided. Either administered alone or in combination with other vaccine antigens including diphtheria,tetanus,whole cell or acellular peussis,Hepatitis B, or Haemophilus influenza type b. Primary/initial course consists of 4 inoculation: first 3doses given at an interval of 1-2 months and 4 th dose 6-12 months after 3 rd dose. First dose given when the infant is 6 weeks old. Additional doses recommended prior to school entry and then every 5 yrs until the age of 18. Alternatively one/two doses of OPV can be safely given as boosters after an initial course of immunisation with inactivated vaccine. Immunity:- induces circulating humoral antibodies(IgM,IgG,IgA). Doesn&;t induce intestinal or local immunity. The circulating antibodies protect the individual against paralytic polio,but do not prevent reinfection of gut by wild viruses. In case of epidemic, IPV is unsustainable because immunity is not rapidly achieved as more than one dose required to induce immunity and injections are to be avoided during epidemic as they are likely to precipitate paralysis.

The inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of the direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water.More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution.A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs.Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 mOsm/l improved the efficacy of ORS regimen for children with acute non-cholera diarrhoea.Reduced osmolarity ORS:-(g/L)Sodium chloride- 2.6Glucose,anhydrous- 13.5Potassium chloride- 1.5Trisodium citrate,dihydrate-2.9Total =20.5 g/LReduced osmolarity ORS:-(mmol/L)Sodium-75Chloride-65Glucose,anhydrous-75Potassium-20Citrate-10Total = 245 mmol/LGuidelines for oral rehydration therapy in first four hours(as per weight)1.

Each dose if 0.5 ml contains > 1000 viral infective units of vaccine strain. Measles vaccine may also contain sorbitol and hydrolysed gelatin as stabilizers and neomycin but it doesn&;t have thiomersal. Age-before 9 months.The age can be lowered to 6 months if there is measles outbreak in community.For infants immunised between 6 and 9 months,second dose administered as soon as possible after the child reaches 9 months provided that at least 4 weeks have elapsed since the last dose. Route-subcutaneous/intramuscular. Immune response- both humoral and cellular. Contraindications- High fever,pregnancy, history of anaphylactic reaction to vaccine components, immunocompromised individuals, leukemia, lymphoma,severe HIV( early stage of HIV is not a contraindication), treatment with steroids, antimetabolites and serious malignancy. Adverse reactions:- TSS-toxic shock syndrome. Occurs when measles vaccine is contaminated or when the same l is used more than once on same day / next day. The vaccine should not be used after 4 hrs of reconstitution. Symptoms of TSS : severe watery diarrhoea, vomiting, high fever repoed within few hours after vaccination. TSS is totally preventable and reflects poor quality of immunisation. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.149}</p>",

Animal host- cattle,sheep, goat, ticks etc. The placenta of infected cows and sheep contain infectious agent which may create infectious aerosols during paurition. Mode of transmission:- No ahropod involved in transmission. Inhalation of infected dust from soil previously contaminated by urine/feces of diseased animals. The organism can also be transmitted through aerosols. Also gain entry through abrasions,conjunctivae or ingestion of contaminated foods. Incubation period-2-3 weeks. Clinical features-fever chills, general malaise and headache. The clinical picture is one of influenza/ non bacterial pneumonia. No rash / local lesions. The infection can cause pneumonia, encephalitis, endocarditis. Treatment- doxycycline (18 months) Pasteurisation/ boiling of milk. Adequate disinfection and disposal of products.

Administration:- WHO programme on immunisation (EPI) and the national immunisation program in India recommend a primary course of 3 doses of vaccine with 1 month interval commencing at 6 weeks. It is recommended that a dose of OPV is required to be given to all children delivered in the hospital before discharge. Very impoant to complete vaccination before 6 months before most cases occur between 6 months- 3 years. Dose -2 drops Immunity:- prevents paralysis and intestinal reinfection. Thus limits virus transmission in community . The vaccine progeny excreted in faeces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts and susceptible contacts in community. Non immunised persons may therefore become immunised. This propey of OPV has been exploited in controlling epidemic . Advantages:- Antibodies quickly produced and therefore helps to control epidemic. Induces both humoral and intestinal immunity. Easy to administer. Complication:- Vaccine associated paralytic polio in recipients of vaccine and their contacts . Contraindications:- Immunocompromised. Malignancy . Leukemia. Storage-Requires to be stored and transpoed at sub zero temperature,unless stabilized. Problems with OPV:- 1. Instability of vaccine at high temperatures. 2. Frequent vaccine failures. 3. Small residual neurovirulence.

Source of infection- B.peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&;t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions.

It is recommended that a dose of OPV is required to be given to all children delivered in the hospital before discharge. Very impoant to complete vaccination before 6 months before most cases occur between 6 months- 3 years. Dose -2 drops Immunity:- prevents paralysis and intestinal reinfection. Thus limits virus transmission in community . The vaccine progeny excreted in faeces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts and susceptible contacts in community. Non immunised persons may therefore become immunised. This propey of OPV has been exploited in controlling epidemic . Advantages:- Antibodies quickly produced and therefore helps to control epidemic. Induces both humoral and intestinal immunity. Easy to administer. Complication:- Vaccine associated paralytic polio in recipients of vaccine and their contacts . Contraindications:- Immunocompromised. Malignancy . Leukemia. Storage-Requires to be stored and transpoed at sub zero temperature,unless stabilized. Problems with OPV:- 1. Instability of vaccine at high temperatures. 2. Frequent vaccine failures. 3. Small residual neurovirulence.

Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 mOsm/l improved the efficacy of ORS regimen for children with acute non cholera diarrhoea.

Clinically characterised by insidious onset with mild fever and an irritating cough, gradually becoming paroxysmal with the characteristic whoop often with cyanosis and vomiting. Also known as \"Hundred day cough\". AGENT FACTORS:- 1. Agent-B.peussis. Small percentage of case are caused by B.parapeussis, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus. 2. Source of infection- B.peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&;t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&;t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B.parapeussis. Mode of transmission:- Mainly by droplet infection and direct contact. Each time the patient coughs,sneezes or talks, the bacilli are sprayed into the air. The role of fomites in the spread of disease appears to be very small , unless they are freshly contaminated. Incubation period-7-14 days , but not more than 3 weeks. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.167}</p>",

Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 mOsm/l improved the efficacy of ORS regimen for children with acute non cholera diarrhoea.

Because peripheral nerve trunks are often involved, unless reactions are promptly and adequately treated, such episodes can result in permanent deformities. Type 1 (Reversal Reaction) 1. Delayed hypersensitivity. 2. Occurs in both PB and MB cases in unstable types like BT.BB.BL. 3. Skin lesions suddenly become reddish, swollen, warm, painful, and tender. New lesions may appear. 4. Nerves close to skin may be enlarged, tender.and painful (neuritis) with loss of its functions (loss of sensation and muscle weakness) which may appear suddenly. 5. Other organs - not affected. 6. General symptoms - not common. Treatment of Lepra reactions (moderate to severe cases) It includes bed rest, rest to affected nerves by splint, analgesics, prednisolone. Each case of reaction should be assessed for his/her fitness to put on prednisolone as per check list given above Prednisolone tablets issued must be entered in 'Prednisolone card'. Tapering of prednisolone may be done according to its response. Patient must be instructed on salt restriction, no prednisolone intake on empty stomach and repoing adverse effects/symptoms immediately. Adding Clofazimine for Type II reaction may be extremely useful for reducing or withdrawing coicosteroids in patients who have become dependent on them. Total duration of Clofazimine therapy should not exceed 12 months. If a patient develops lepra reaction during the treatment, do not stop MDT (rather complete the course of MDT). Lepra reactions, which occur after completion of treatment, should also be managed as mentioned earlier. MDT should not be restaed for such cases. Response to treatment should be monitored and assessed, including check on adverse effects of prednisolone. Before staing the steroid treatment, the patient should be asked questions about epigestric pain and diarrhoea, with or without blood and or mucous; and examined for fungal infection, scabies, and worm infestations, as all these conditions may be made worse by steroids. Treatment of all these conditions can be staed at the same time as steroids are staed. Before staing the steroid treatment the patient should be explained the reason for treatment; the duration of the treatment; impoance of taking daily dose and that the treatment should not be stopped suddenly (the dosage is decreased gradually) and impoance of completing the full course of treatment; and possible side-effects.

WHO recommends the &;Danish 1331&; strain for vaccine production. Stable for several weeks at ambient temperature in a tropical climate and for upto 1 year if kept away from direct light and stored in a cool environment below 10 deg celcius. Vaccine must be protected from light ( wrapped up in a double layer of red/ black cloth). Normal saline is recommended as diluent for reconstituting the vaccine as distilled water may cause irritation. Reconstituted vaccine may be used within 3 hours. Dosage-0.1 mg in 0.1 ml volume. The dose of newborn below 4 weeks is 0.05 ml. Afministered intradermally using tuberculin syringe. Injected slightly above the inseion of left deltoid. If injected too high / too low adjacent lymph nodes may become involved and tender. The vaccine must not be contaminated with an antiseptic/detergent. If alcohol is used to swab the skin , it must be allowed to evaporate before the vaccine is given. Phenomenon after vaccination:/ 2-3 weeks after a correct intradermal injection of a potent vaccine, a papule develops at the site of vaccination. It increases slowly in size and reaches a a diameter of about 4-8 mm in 5 weeks. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow ulcer but usually seen covered by a crust. Healing occurs within 6-12weeks leaving a permanent,tiny, round scar (4-8 mm in diameter).This is a normal reaction. Normally the individual become mantoux postive after 8 weeks has elapsed. Adverse reactions: prolonged severe ulceration at the site of vaccination, suppurative lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis and disseminated BCG infection. Contraindications: BCG should not be given to patients with generalised eczema, infective dermatosis, hypogammaglobulinemia , those with history of deficient immunity, patients under immunosuppressive treatment and in pregnancy. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.196}</p>",

Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs.

Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 mOsm/l improved the efficacy of ORS regimen for children with acute non cholera diarrhoea.
