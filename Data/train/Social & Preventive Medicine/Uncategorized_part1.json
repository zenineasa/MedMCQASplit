The cards are drawn one by one and thus patients are allocated into trial and control groups. 2. Table of Random Numbers Published tables of Random numbers are used. This is considered to be the best method of randomization. A computer program is used for randomization o Randomization methods, which may at first seem reasonable (odd-even day randomization or daytime-nighttime convenience randomization), may actually suppo bias, paicularly if the study is open-label or the operator or subject are not blinded as to the nature of the intervention. For example, if the study involves a procedure such as wound irrigation and the patients are randomized to have wounds irrigated with sterile saline on even days and tap water on odd days, a patient may present on an even day and the treating clinical investigator may elect not to enroll the patient in the study or to break the randomization, because they \"just think that this paicular wound needs saline irrigation. \" This is a very common error in otherwise well-designed clinical studies.",

Primary prevention aims to prevent the disease from occurring. So primary prevention reduces both the incidence and prevalence of a disease. Encouraging people to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet rays is an example of primary prevention of skin cancer. Secondary prevention is used after the disease has occurred, but before the person notices that anything is wrong. A doctor checking for suspicious skin growths is an example of secondary prevention of skin cancer. The goal of secondary prevention is to find and treat disease early. In many cases, the disease can be cured. Secondary prevention can be defined as action which halts the progress of a disease at its incipient stage and prevents complications. The specific interventions are early diagnosis (e. g. screening tests, case finding programmes) and adequate treatment. Teiary prevention targets the person who already has symptoms of the disease The goals of teiary prevention are: Prevent damage and pain from the disease - Slow down the disease - Prevent the disease from causing other problems (These are called \"complications. \") - Give better care to people with the disease - Make people with the disease healthy again and able to do what they used to do Developing better treatments for melanoma is an example of teiary prevention. Examples include better surgeries, new medicines, etc.",

SS source refers to oral intercourseperformed on a man Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use. MC mode of transmission: Hetero-sexual In hetero-sexual transmission: Male to female is commoner (as compared to female to male) Chances of transmission with accidental needle prick: 0. 3%. Less commonly, HIV may be spread From mother to child during pregnancy, bih, or breastfeeding. Although the risk can be high if a mother is living with HIV and not taking medicine, recommendations to test all pregnant women for HIV and sta HIV treatment immediately have lowered the number of babies who are born with HIV. In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by Oral sex--putting the mouth on the penis (fellatio), vagina (cunnilingus), or anus (rimming). In general, there's little to no risk of getting HIV from oral sex. Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV. This was more common in the early years of HIV, but now the risk is extremely small because of rigorous testing of the blood supply and donated organs and tissues. Eating food that has been pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver's mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants. Being bitten by a person with HIV. Each of the very small number of documented cases has involved severe trauma with extensive tissue damage and the presence of blood. There is no risk of transmission if the skin is not broken. Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids. Deep, open-mouth kissing if both paners have sores or bleeding gums and blood from the HIV-positive paner gets into the bloodstream of the HIV-negative paner. HIV is not spread through saliva.",

It is administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Only one dose is required. The vaccine confers protection 7 days after injection. To maintain protection, re-vaccination is recommended every 3 years. The vaccine is licensed for individuals aged 2 years. - It does not elicit immune response in children < 2 years. The vaccine is stable for 6 months at 37deg C and for 2 years at 20degC. The recommended storage temprature is 2-8degC. The Vi polysaccharide vaccine can be co-administered with other vaccines relevant for international travellers-such as yellow fever and hepatitis A Acyclovir is given to prevent the development of systemic disease in varicella infected immunosuppresed patients & can halt the progression of zoster in adults. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin given within 72 hrs of exposure can prevent chicken pox and is recommended in exposed immunocompromised persons. A live attenuated varicella vaccine is recommended for children between 12-18 months. It is effective even if given within 3-5 days after exposure. 2. The Ty 21a oral vaccine It is an orally administered, live attenuated Ty2 strain of S. Typhi in which multiple genes (including for Vi Capsular polysaccharide) have been mutated chemically. This lyophilized vaccine is available in 2 preparations:? 1. Enteric coated capsules - Used for travellers to developing countries. It is used in individuals 5 years of age. 2. Liquid suspension - Used by public health programmes for young children in developing countries. It can be administered from the age of 2 years. Vaccine is administered on 1, 3 and 5the day, i. e., a 3-dose regimen is recommended. Vaccine confers protection 7 days after the last dose. The recommendation is to repeat this series (3 doses) every 3 years for people living in endemic areas, and every year for individuals travelling from non-endemic to endemic countries. Ty 21 a requires storage at 2-8degC, it retains potency for approximately 14 days at 25degC. Proguanil and antibacterial drugs should be stopped from 3 days before until 3 days after giving Ty 21 a, as these drugs may harm live bacteria. The vaccine is not efficacious if administered at the time of ongoing diarrhea. Avoided during diarrhoea as efficacy will reduce. Can be given to HIV +ve, asymptomatic persons with CD4 cell count of > 200/mm3 Well tolerated and has low rates of adverse events. Not recommended in congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, acute febrile illness, acute intestinal infection and in patients on antimitotic drugs May be given simultaneously with live vaccines of polio, cholera, yellow fever and MMR.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., 98% of individuals Recommended Dietary allowance (RDA) o Also know as recommended daily allowance. o The RDA is the average daily dietary intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirments of nearly all (97 to 98%) individuals in a life stage and gender group. o The RDA applies to individuals, not to groups. o The estimated average requirement (EAR) serves as the foundation for setting RDA. If the standard detion (SD) of the EAR is available and the requirement for the nutrient is normally distributed, the RDA is set at 2 SDs above the EAR. RDA EAR 4- 2 SDFAR Adequate intake (AD o The adequate intake is set instead of an RDA if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to calculate an EAR. o The AI is based on observed or experimentally determined estimates of average nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of healthy people. o For example. the \"adequate intake\" for young infants for whom human milk is the recommended sole source of food for the first 4 to 6 months, is based on the estimated daily mean nutrient intake supplied by human milk for healthy, full term infants who are exclusively breastfed. RIM Vs Adequate intakes (Al) Although RDA and Al are used for the same purpose - setting goals for intake by individuals - The RDA differs from the Al. RDA is expected to meet the needs of 97 to 98% of the individuals, while it is not known what percentage of individuals arc covered by the adequate intake. o The adequate intake does not bear a consistent relationship to the EAR or the RDA because it is set without being able to estimate the average requirement. It is assumed that adequate intake is at or above the RDA if one could be calculated. o The adequate intake for a nutrient is expected to exceed the average requirement for that nutrient, and it should cover the needs for more than 98% of the individuals, but it might cover the needs of far fewer. o The degree to which adequate intake exceeds the average requirements is likely to differ among nutrients and population groups. For people with diseases that increases requirements or who have other special health needs, the RDA and adequate intake may serve as the basis for adjusting individual recommendations, qualified health professionals should adapt the recommended intake to cover the higher or lower needs. Tolerable upper intake level (UL): - The highest average daily nutrient intake level that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects for almost all individuals in the general population. As intake increases above UL, the potential risk of adverse effect increases.",

        "question": "Limits of confidence of a hypothesis determined by?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., 1-Level of significance First read about these different terms:? Confidence interval It is the interval within which a parameter value is expected to lie with ceain confidence levels, as could be revealed by repeated samples. o It is the interval (range) around the mean of population in which the means of multiple samples of same population are dispersed. o If independent samples are taken repeatedly from the same population, and a confidence interval is calculated, then a ceain percentage (confidence level) of the intervals will include the unknown population parameter. o For example 95% of sample means will be covered by 2. SD from population mean here. Confidence level --> 95%. 95% confidence interval for population mean --> Mean +- 2. SD. o A narrow confidence interval is always preferable as it tells more precisely about the population mean:-- i) Large the sample size, narrower the confidence interval. ii) Smaller the Standard detion, narrower the confidence interval. Confidence limits o Are the upper and lower boundries of confidence interval, i. e., the values which define the range of confidence interval. Confidence limits is calculated by mean and standard detion. I am giving a very simple example:? o If mean weight of a sample of children in a school is 30 Kg and SD is 1. Then. i) Confidence interval = Mean +- 2. SD = 30 +- 2 = 28 to 32 kg. ii) Confidence level = 95% (that means 95% of values will be covered under the range 38 to 32). iii) Confidence limit = 28 (lower limit) and 32 (upper limit) Level of significance Level of significance is the criterian used to rejecting null hypothesis, i. e., to find out significant difference between two variable. o In simple words, it is defined as the probability of making a decision to reject the null hypothesis. o The decision is often made by using p value, i. e., p value denotes significance level. P vlalue 0. 01 means that there is 99% of probability of rejecting null hypothesis when it is false, that is there is significant difference between two variable. o The significance level is usually set at 0. 05 (p=0. 05). The smaller the p-value (significance level), the more significant the result said to be. Now explanation for this question is:? Confidence intervals are closely related to statistical significance testing. In many situations, if the point estimate of parameter is 'X', with confidence interval `a-b' at confidence level P, then any value outside this interval (a-b) will be significantly different from X at significance level a =1 - P under the same distributional assumption that were made to generate the confidence interval. o That means, if in an estimtion of second parameter we obsrved a value less than 'a' or greater than 'b' we would reject null hypothesis that the true value of this parameter equaled 'X' at the level of significance. o Conversely, if the estimate of second parameter lay within the interval `a-b', we would be unable to reject the null hypothesis that the parameter equaled 'X'. In consequence, if the estimates of two parameters have a confidence interval at a given P value that do not overlap, it is very likely that the two values are significantly different at the corresponding value of a.",

Other important species are X. astia, X. brasiliensis and Pulex irritans. Both sexes of flea bite and transmit the disease. A partially blocked flea (a flea with partially blocked proventriculus) is more dangerous than a completely blocked flea. Rat flea can survive upto 4 years in rat burrows under optimum conditions. This is considered the most likely mechanism of maintaining the natural focus. Modes of transmission may be: Bite of infected flea Direct contact with tissues of infected animal Droplet infection (in pneumonic plague), There are three types of plague: Bubonic plague (most common type) with incubation period 2-7 days Pneumonic plague (most virulent and least common) with incubation period 1-3 days Septicemic plague (less infectious) with incubation period 2-7 days.

It is only an initial examination. Those who are found to have positive test results are refen-ed to a physician for fuher diagnostic work-up & treatment. High specificity is a necessary attribute for a diagnostic test. Below are given the differences between screening and diagnostic tests. Screening test Diagnostic test * Done on apparently healthy Done on those with indications or sick (asymptomatic) * Applied to groups Applied to single patients, all diseases are considered * Test results are arbitrary and final Diagnosis is not final but modified in light of new evidence, diagnosis is the sum of all evidence 4. Based on one criterion or cut-off Based on evaluation of a number of symptoms, signs and point (e. g., diabetes) laboratory findings Less accurate More accurate 6. Less expensive More expensive 7. Not a basis for treatment Used as a basis for treatment 8 The initiative comes from the investigator or agency providing care The initiative comes from a patient with a complaint Criteria for Screening test Screening test must satisfy the criteria of - acceptability - repeatability - validity - simplicity - safety - rapidity - ease of administration - low cost 1. Acceptability - Considering that screening tests are applied on asymptomatic people in large numbers, a high rate of people cooperation is needed. Thus the tests should be acceptable to the people. In general, tests that are painful, discomfoing or embarrasing (eg. rectal or vaginal examinations) are not likely to be acceptable to the population in mass campaigns. 2. Repeatability (Precision or reproducibility) - means that the test must give consistent results when repeated more than once on the same individual or material under the same conditions. 3. Low cost - A screening should be inexpensive. As a screening test has to be applied on millions of people to identify a small percentage who have early disease or its precursors, an expensive test however good, cannot justify use of restricted financial resources that has to be used for fuher diagnostic workup and t/t of those screened on positives. 4. High safety margin - This is an attribute of any test, whether diagnostic or screening. Moresoever for screening as screening tests are to be applied on millions of asymptomatic people and any adverse effect would bring whole process into disrepute. iims IN/nee answers & explanations -- May 2007 5. Validity - It expresses the ability of a test to separate or distinguish those who have the disease from those who do not - Validity has two components - sensitivity & specificity - An ideal screening test should be both highly sensitive and highly specific.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is distinct from cost-benefit analysis, which assigns a monetary value to the measure of effect. Cost-effectiveness analysis is often used in the field of health services, where it may be inappropriate to monetize health effect. Typically the CEA is expressed in terms of a ratio where the denominator is a gain in health from a measure (years of life, premature bihs aveed, sight-years gained) and the numerator is the cost associated with the health gain.

Alum (hydrated aluminium salts) - a coagulant commonly used for water treatment is used to flocculate fluoride ions in the water. Since the process is best carried out under alkaline conditions, lime is added. For the disinfection purpose bleaching powder is added. After thorough stirring, the chemical elements coagulate into flocs and settle down in the bottom. Salient features of Nalgonda technique No regeneration of media No handling of caustic acids and alkalis Readily available chemicals used in conventional municipal water treatment are only required Adaptable to domestic use Applicable in batch as well as in continuous operation to suit needs simplicity of design, construction, operation and maintenance Local skills could be readily employed Higly efficient removal of fluorides from 1. 5 to 20 mg/ L to desirable levels Simultaneous removal of color, odor, turbidity, bacteria and organic contaminants Normally associated alkalinity ensures fluoride removal efficiency Sludge generated is conveible to alum for use elsewhere Little wastage of water and least disposal problem Needs minimum of mechanical and electrical equipment No energy except muscle power for domestic equipment Economical - annual cost of defluoridation (1991 basis) of water at 401pcd works out to Rs. 20/- for domestic treatment and Rs. 85/- for community treatment using fill and draw system based on 5000 population for water with 5 mg/ L and 400 mg/ L alkalinity which requires 600 mg/ L alum dose. Provides defluoridated water of uniform acceptable quality Disadvantages: Fluoride elimination rate is low (70 - 80%) The right amounts of chemicals need to be added Residual aluminium in the water is a constant danger High sulphate concentrations in the water make it taste salty.

In this case, sensitivity equals the number of babies born with trisomy 21 whose mothers tested positive (100) divided by the total number of babies born with trisomy 21. This yields 100/200 = 50% (not a very sensitive test). 40% corresponds to the prevalence of the disease in the tested population, which in this case equals the total number of babies with Down's syndrome (true positive + false negative = 100 + 100= 200) divided by the total number of people tested (500). This yields 200/500= 40%. 67% corresponds to the positive predictive value of the test, which equals the number of babies with Down's whose mothers test positive (true positives = 100) divided by the total number of mothers testing positive(true positive + false positive = 150). This yields 100/150 = 67%. 71% corresponds to the negative predictive value of the test, which equals the number of normal babies whose mothers tested negative (250) divided by the total number of people testing negative (350).

        "exp": "Coefficient of variance Coefficient of variance indicates how large standard deviation is relative to mean, i. e. Coefficient of variance is a relative comparison of a standard deviation to its mean. It is expressed as percentage. CV = Standard deviation / mean x 100 For example, if the standard deviation of a sample is 8 and the sample mean is 44. The CV will be 18. 2%. That means the standard deviation is 18. 2% of the value of mean. Significance of coefficient of variance CV is a measure used to Compare relative variability when the mean is different in sample to be compared or in character (variables) to be compared - CV compares variability of two different characteristics (e. g., BP, Serum creatinine, height, weight etc.) in the same group of subjects. In this situation mean BP of the sample will have different value (e. g., 120) and mean creatinine level will have different value (e. g., 0. 8) in the same group (sample). CV can compare variability of the same character in two or more different groups (samples). For example taking the height in a group from India and in other group from USA. Both the samples will have different mean height. In these situations, when the mean is different for characteristics to be compared, CV is used to compare the relative variability. Taking the example of given question: CV for BP in a group is 20%. CV for serum creatinine in the same group is 15%. That means for BP, standard deviation is 20% of the mean; and for creatinine, standard deviation is 15% of the mean. It has already been explained that standard deviation is measure of variation (deviation). Therefore, in the given question variability is more in BP than in serum creatinine value. So, Coefficient of variance is used to compare variability of two different characteristic in same group or to compare variability of the same character in different groups (as the mean is different in both these situations). Since coefficient of variance is a ratio, it has no units of measurement (dimensionless). It can be used to compare variability irrespective of the units of measurement used in two or more different group. For example It can compare variability if height measures as cm in one group & inches in another group. About option 'c & d' We cannot comment on standard deviation by knowing just only the coefficient of variance because we don't know the mean BP and mean creatinine level of the sample group -> In three related variables (Here CV, SD & mean) you must know the value of two variables to comment on value of the third one. However, in this question we can say that the standard deviation relative to mean is large for BP than for serum creatinine. So, we cannot comment on absolute value of standard deviation (whether SD of BP is more or SD of creatinine is more), But we can comment on standard deviation relative to mean.",

These children if they tend to have refractive errors, are then referred to the health assistants and ophthalmologists. The National Programme for Control of Blindness was staed in the year 1986 - 1989 in collaboration with WHO with the main aim of reducing the prevalence of blindness from 1. 4% to 0. 3% of population by 2000 AD. By this programme it was facilitated to provide comprehensive health care facilities for primary, secondary and teiary levels of eye health care. According to the NPCB, the major causes of blindness in India are cataract, trachoma, smallpox, infections, injuries, vitamin A deficiency, glaucoma, aphakia, refractive errors, central corneal opacification and posterior segment disorders. The objectives of National Programme for Control of Blindness are as follows: 1. Through mass communication and extensive education programmes, people were to be educated about eye health care. 2. Ceain units of eye care facilities were established in order to restore sight and allete eye ailments. 3. As a pa of general health services, at peripheral, central and intermediate levels various permanent eye health care centres were established.

Mechanism of actions of IUDs 1) Most accepted Induce a foreign - body reaction that results in chronic inflammatory reaction --> cellular and biochemical changes in the endometrium and uterine fluids. These changes impair the bility of the gamete and thus reduce its chances of feilization rather than its implantation. \"IUDs prevent feilization primarily by interfering with the ability of sperm to survive and to ascend the fallopion tubes, where feilization curs\". Reaserch aicles \"Whatever the IUD's specific mechanism of action, it appears that the IUD effectively interrupts the reproductive process of implantation \". 2) In medicated IUDs, copper enchances the cellular response in the endometrium. By altering the biochemical composition of cervical mucus, copper ions may affect sperm motility, capaciation and survival. Hormone - releasing devices increase the viscosity of cervical mucus and thereby prevent sperm from entering the cervix. They also maintain high level of progesterone in the endometrium and thus, relatively low levels of estrogen, thereby sustaining an endometrium unourable to implantation.",

Serial interval The gap time between onset of primary case and secondary case. By collecting information about a whole series of such onset, we get a distribution of secondary cases from which we can guess the incubation period. Generation time Interval between receipt of infecton by host and maximal infectivity of the host. Generation time is roughly equal to the incubation period. About option 'b' Communicable period The time during which an infectious agent may be transferred directly or indirectly from an infected person to another person. The period of communicability has no relation with incubation period, it merely reflects the duration when the infectious agent may be transferred. This may occur during incubation period, during actual illness or during convalsescence.

Antigenic drift involves point mutation in the gene owing to selection pressure by immunity in the host population Antigenic drift accounts for the periodic epidemics of influenza. Occurs every 2-3 years in case of Influenza A and every 4-7 years in case of Influenza-B 2) Antigenic shift An abrupt, drastic, discontinuous variation in the antigenic structure.

Analytic and experimental studies test the hypothesis, derived from descriptive studies and confirm or refute the observed association between suspected causes and disease. Association may be defined as the concurrence of two variables more often than would be expected by chance. In other words, events are said to be associated when they occur more frequently togeher than one would expect by chance. Association can be of following types: - 1. Spurious association Observed association between a disease and suspected factor is spurious, i. e., not real. In other words there is an observed association when none actually exists. 2. Indirect association The indirect association is a statistical association between a variable of interest and a disease due to the presence of another factor, known or unknown, that is common to both the variable and the disease. This third factor (i. e., the common factor) is also known as the confounding variable. For example, endemic goitre (disease) is found at high altitudes (variable), showing thereby an association between altitude and endemic goitre. But it is due to iodine deficiency which is common at high altitude. So, iodine deficiency acts as a confounding factor as it is associated with both high altitude and endemic goitre. 3. Direct (causal) association a) One to one causal relationship Two variables are stated to be causally related if change in one is followed by change in other. If It does not, then their relationship cannot be causal. b) Multifactorial causation The causal thinking is different in non-communicable disease (e. g., CHD) where the etiology is multifactorial, i. e., more than one factors are associated with disease causation.",

A: None (Its Indices of Urinary excretion of Iodine) Neonatal hypothyroidism is a sensitive pointer to environmental iodine deficiency and is thus an effective indicator for monitoring the impact of the iodine deficiency control programme. Neonatal thyroid screening using serum thyrotropin (TSH) as the primary screening test detects not only permanent sporadic congenital hypothyroidism, whose incidence is about 1 per 4000 bihs, but also compensated or transient primary hypothyroidism, whose incidence can be as high as 1 in 10 neonates and whose main cause is iodine deficiency. Elevated serum TSH in the neonate indicates insufficient supply of thyroid hormones to the developing brain, and therefore, constitutes the only indicator that allows prediction of possible impairment of mental development at a population level, which is the main consequence of iodine deficiency. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD) included neonatal TSH as one of the indicators for assessing iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) and their control.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Low validity and low reliability o Reliability is synonymous with consistency of test, i. e. it should produce consistent results when repeated n number of times. o Validity refers to the degree in which our test or other measuring device is truly measuring what we intended it to measure, i. e. accuracy of the test. The validity often is associated by comparing a measurement method with the best possible method of measure that is available. For example, the validity of BP measurements obtained by a sphygmonanometer might be compared with those obtained by intra-aerial measurements. o A test may have: (1) High Reliability (consistent) and High validity (accurate) The test produces consistent results when repeated several times and values are close to the true values. In above graph and figure the test has produced consistent results whose values are around the true values. For example, a person of 70 kg steps on a scale 10 times gets reading 69, 69, 70, 71, 69, 69, 71, 70. So, the test is showing consistent results (69-71 kg) and the values are very close to the true values. (2) Low reliability and low validity The test produces inconsistent results and values are far from the true values. For example, a person of 200 pounds steps on a scale 10 times and gets reading of 15, 250, 95, 140, 80, 100, 130, 400, 50, 100. So, the tests results are inconsistent and the values are far away from the true value. The test produces consistent results but the values are far away from true value. For example, a person of 200 pounds steps on a scale 10 times and gets reading 150 pounds all ten times. So, the tests resulsts are consistent (150 pounds all ten times) but values are far away from true value. o From above discussion it is clear that reliability does not imply validity. A test may be reliable (consistent) but not valid (accurate). However, unreliable test (inconsistent) test cannot be valid. \"Reliability is necessary but not sufficient for validity\" Coming to the question o Test in question showing different values everytime it is repeated. So, the result is not reliable (inconsistent). o Unreliable test cannot be valid. o So, the test in question has low reliability and low validity.",

Later on, as recommended by WHO, it was decided to increase the age group from decided to increase the age group from under 3 to under 5 years So, now PPI targets children under 5 years of age. o The term pulse has been used to describe this sudden, simultaneous, mass administration of OPV on a single day to all children 0-5 years of age, regardless to previous immunization status. o PPIs occur as two rounds about 4 to 6 weeks apa during low transmission season of polio, i. e. between november to february (In India, peak transmission is from june to september). o The dose of OPV during PPIs are extra doses which supplement, and do not replace the doses received during routine immunization schedule. Intensive pulse polio immunization (IPPI) is the intensification of PPI by adding additional rounds at fixed booths followed by 'house - to - house search-and-vaccinate' component.",

It is a simple operation that can turn out lashes which are scratching the cornea. patients can be operated on in a local dispensary or health center, or other community space if properly prepared. The surgical procedure can be performed by those who have had surgical training: eye doctors, eye nurses or eye care assistants. A - Antibiotic treatment of people with active trachoma infection. Regular detection and treatment of people with active trachoma is important. The recommended treatment is as follows: Wash the face and clean the eyes Apply tetracycline 1% ointment to both eyes two times daily for six weeks The ointment is sticky and may blur the vision for a few moments. This will only last a few moments. If possible, treat all the children in the family. F - Clean Faces Families and individuals can do something to protect themselves from infection by increasing the number of times a child washes his/her face. Regular face washing removes discharge so that flies are not attracted to faces. It does not require great quantities of water: one liter of water can wash up to 30 faces. E - Environmental Improvement GET 2020: A global initiative to eliminate trachoma as a blinding disease, entitled GET 2020 (Global Elimination of Trachoma), was launched under WHO's leadership in 1997.

A group should not comprise less than 6 and not more than 12 members. 3) Panel Discussion: In a panel discussion, 4 to 8 qualified persons talk about a topic and discuss a given problem in front of a large group or audience. 4) Symposium: A symposium is a series of speeches on a selected subject. There is no discussion among the symposium members like in panel discussion. 5) Workshop: It consists of a series of meeting usually four or more, with emphasis on individual work, within the group, with the help of consultants and resource personnel. The total workshop may be divided into small groups and each group will solve and discuss a problem with the help of consultants. 6) Role Playing Role Playing is a socio-drama based on assumptions that many values in a situation cannot be expressed in words and the communication can be more effective if the situation is dramatized by the group. 7) Demonstration: It is a carefully prepared presentation to show how to perform a skill or procedure. Here procedure (eg. disinfection of well, preparation of ORS) is carried out step by step before an audience or the target group. Teaching about ORS in shims is best done by demonstration. 8) Conferences and Seminars",

        "exp": "Most medical waste is incinerated, a practice that is short-lived because of environmental considerations. The burning of solid and regulated medical waste generated by health care creates many problems. Medical waste incinerators emit toxic air pollutants and toxic ash residues that are the major source of dioxins in the environment. The toxic ash residues sent to landfills for disposal have the potential to leach into groundwater. Medical waste has been identified by US Environmental Agency as the third largest known source of dioxin air emission and contributor of about 10% of mercury emissions to the environment from human activities. The air emissions affect the local environment and may affect communities hundreds or thousands of miles away. Dioxin is one of the most toxic chemicals known to humankind. Dioxins have been linked to cancer, immune system disorders, diabetes, birth defects and disrupted sexual develop\u00adment. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of WHO, acknowledged dioxins cancer causing potential and classified it as human carcinogen. To avoid dioxin production, no chlorinated plastic bags (and preferably no other chlorinated corn pounds) should be introduced into the incinerator. Red bags must not be incinerated as red colour contains cadmium, which causes toxic emissions. If mercury-containing items are put into a red bag for infectious waste and sent to an incinerator or other waste treatment technology, mercury will contaminate the environment. Airborne mercury then enters a global distribution cycle in the environment, contaminating fish and wildlife. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cross the blood- brain barrier as well as the placenta. Public concerns about incinerator emissions, as well as the creation of federal regulations for medical waste incinerators, are causing many health care facilities to rethink their choices in medical waste treatment. As stated by Health Care without Harm, an international coalition of 470 organizations in 52 countries, non-incineration treatment technologies are a growing and developing field. Some technologies are still essentially prototypes, while others, such as autoclave technology, have been used for decades.",

How long would one be quarantined? o The individual and often the entire family will stay at home until the risk of developing the disease or its symptoms is over that means maximum incubation period, because following exposure symptoms develop after incubation period. So, if after maximum incubation period for a specific disease, exposed person does not develop disease that means that person has not acquired infection and the person should be allowed to move.

        "exp": "The median A median is described as the value separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. It does not depend on the total, and number of items. To obtain the median, the data is first arranged in an ascending or descending order of magnitude, and then the value of the middle observation is located, which is called median. For example, diastolic BP of 9 individuals was as follows - 83, 75, 81, 79, 71, 95, 75, 77, 84 Now data is arranged in ascending order - 71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 95 Here, 79 is the middle observation that is separating the upper four values from lower four values, so it is the median. If there are two values in the middle instead of one, the median is worked out by taking the average of the two middle values. For example, If diastolic BP of 10 individuals is as follows:- 83, 75, 81, 79, 71, 95, 75, 77, 84, 90 Data is arranged in ascending order - 71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 90, 95 Here two values are separating the upper half of values from lower half. So the median here is - Median = (79 + 81) / 2 = 80 Advantage of median The value of median is not affected by abnormal very high or very low value. Taking the example as was taken in mean - The income of 7 people per day in rupees is as follows 5, 5, 5, 7, 10, 20, 300 = (Total 352) Here mean = 50. 3 median = 7 The value of mean has affected seriously, whereas median is not affected, and median is more nearer to the truth. So, median is used when the distribution of values is skewed (deviated) with some small number of very high values -> median is used for skewed distribution.",

Yellow signals medium priority Sometimes the coding medium is as simple as rolls of colored tape. A person with some medical training--and a checklist--goes among the injured and wraps a strip of tape around the leg of an injured person.
