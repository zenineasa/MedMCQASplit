C: 110 mg orally on two successive days Nearly all of the early stages of xerophthalmia can be reversed by administration of a massive dose (2, 00, 000 IU or 110 mg of retinol palmitate) orally on 2 successive days Xerophthalmia/ Dry eyes Condition in which the eye fails to produce tears. Xerophthalmia caused by a severe vitamin A deficiency is described by pathologic dryness of the conjunctiva and * cornea. The conjunctiva becomes dry, thick and wrinkled. If untreated, it can lead to corneal ulceration and ultimately to blindness as a result of corneal damage. Xerophthalmia is a term that usually implies a destructive dryness of the conjunctival epithelium due to dietary vitamin A deficiency -- a rare condition in developed countries, but still causing much damage in developing countries. Other forms of dry eye are associated with aging, poor lid closure, scarring from previous injury, or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid ahritis and Sj. Ogren's syndrome, and these can all cause chronic conjunctivitis. Radioiodine therapy can also induce xerophthalmia, often transiently Xerophthalmia from hypovitaminosis A is specifically due to lack of the hormone-like vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid Treatment can occur in two ways: treating symptoms and treating the deficiency. Treatment of symptoms usually includes use of aificial tears in the form of eye drops, increasing the humidity of the environment with humidifiers, and wearing wrap around glasses when outdoors. Treatment of the deficiency can be accomplished with a Vitamin A or multivitamin supplement or by eating foods rich in Vitamin A. Treatment with supplements and/or diet can be successful until the disease progresses as far as corneal ulceration, at which point only an extreme surgery can offer a chance of returning sight.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Type I error Statistical errors Statistical errors are used to describe possible errors made in statistical decision. Before reading about the types of error you must know null hypothesis because these tests are related to null hypothesis. Null hypothesis says - Any kind of difference or significance you see in a set of data is due to chance and not significant that means there is no variation (difference) exists between variables. Null hypothesis testing (e. g., in Chisquare test) is used to make a decision about whether: - i) The data contradict the null hypothesis - That means there is true difference (which is significant) between variables and it is not due to chance. Or ii) The data approve the null hypothesis There is no difference between variables and the difference you see is due to chance. Now see types of error:? There are two basic type of statistical errors:? Type I error Type II error Type I error It is also known as an error of first kind or a-error or false positive. This type of error rejects null hypothesis when it is true - False rejection of null hypothesis. That means in real there is no difference (as null hypothesis says) but we observe a difference (by rejecting the null hypotesis due to error). In very simple words \"we observe a difference when it is not true\" - false positive. One of the simplest example of this would be if a test shows that a women is pregnant when in reality she is not, i. e., she is false positive for pregnancy. Probability of type-I error is given by 'P-value' (probability of declaring a significant difference when actually it is not present). Significance (a) level is the maximum tolerable probability of type I error. Significance (a) level is fixed in advance and calculation of P value (probability of type I error) can be less than, equal to or greater than the significance (a) level. If the probability of type I error (P -value) is less than significance (a) level, the results are declared statistically significant. Therefore, to declare the results statistical significant, type I error (a-level) should be kept to minimum. Type I error is more serious that type II error. Type II error It is also known as an error or second kind or A-error or false negative. This type of error accept/fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false False acceptance of null hypothesis. That means we fail to observe a difference when in truth there is one - False negative. An example of this would be if a test shows that a woman is not pregnant when in reality she is i. e., she is false negative.",

For example, if the study involves a procedure such as wound irrigation and the patients are randomized to have wounds irrigated with sterile saline on even days and tap water on odd days, a patient may present on an even day and the treating clinical investigator may elect not to enroll the patient in the study or to break the randomization, because they \"just think that this paicular wound needs saline irrigation. \" This is a very common error in otherwise well-designed clinical studies.",

D: Cervical pap smear checking The levels of prevention: Primordial prevention is prevention of the emergence/development of the risk factors in countries/population in which they have not yet appeared. e. g. obesity and hypertension prevention Primary prevention methods are used before the person gets the disease. Primary prevention aims to prevent the disease from occurring. So primary prevention reduces both the incidence and prevalence of a disease. Encouraging people to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet rays is an example of primary prevention of skin cancer. Secondary prevention is used after the disease has occurred, but before the person notices that anything is wrong. A doctor checking for suspicious skin growths is an example of secondary prevention of skin cancer. The goal of secondary prevention is to find and treat disease early. In many cases, the disease can be cured. Secondary prevention can be defined as action which halts the progress of a disease at its incipient stage and prevents complications. The specific interventions are early diagnosis (e. g. screening tests, case finding programmes) and adequate treatment. Teiary prevention targets the person who already has symptoms of the disease The goals of teiary prevention are: Prevent damage and pain from the disease - Slow down the disease - Prevent the disease from causing other problems (These are called \"complications. \") - Give better care to people with the disease - Make people with the disease healthy again and able to do what they used to do Developing better treatments for melanoma is an example of teiary prevention.

Broadly speaking, a trial refers to putting something to a test. This allows the term to be used in reference to a test of a treatment for the sick or a test of a preventive measure intended to ave illness, injury or disease. Therefore, the defining feature of an experimental study is its ability to allocate or assign interventions or treatment to experiment unit. In simple words, the study of a treatment (Drugs, surgical intervention) or preventive measure (e. g. vaccination) on living subjects is known as experimental study or trial. Assignment of treatments may be based on Randamization - In randomized controlled trials Non-randmization trails There are following types of experimental trials Clinical trials: Used to evaluate treatment for people who are ill (e. g. a clinical trial of a chemotherapeutic agent) Field trails: Used to evaluate interventions to prevent disease in healthy people (e. g. a field trial of a vaccine). Community trial: Used to evaluate community-wide intervention (e. g. a community trail of the effects of fluoridation of public water supply). Animal Study: When clincial trails are done on animals (instead of human) is called animal study. In an experimental study, the investigator assign individuals in experimental group and reference group and then follows the two groups for the outcome of interests. Therefore, experimental study is prospective study. Before staing any experimental study the approval of ethics committee is required. The poocol of study is submitted to ethics committee and ethics committee gives approval to the studies which are ethical. So, all experimental studies are considered ethical (after taking approval of ethics committee). There are fewer ethical restrains on experimental study in animals than in human.",

MC mode of transmission: Hetero-sexual In hetero-sexual transmission: Male to female is commoner (as compared to female to male) Chances of transmission with accidental needle prick: 0. 3%. Less commonly, HIV may be spread From mother to child during pregnancy, bih, or breastfeeding. Although the risk can be high if a mother is living with HIV and not taking medicine, recommendations to test all pregnant women for HIV and sta HIV treatment immediately have lowered the number of babies who are born with HIV. In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by Oral sex--putting the mouth on the penis (fellatio), vagina (cunnilingus), or anus (rimming). In general, there's little to no risk of getting HIV from oral sex. Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV. This was more common in the early years of HIV, but now the risk is extremely small because of rigorous testing of the blood supply and donated organs and tissues. Eating food that has been pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver's mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants. Being bitten by a person with HIV. Each of the very small number of documented cases has involved severe trauma with extensive tissue damage and the presence of blood. There is no risk of transmission if the skin is not broken. Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids. Deep, open-mouth kissing if both paners have sores or bleeding gums and blood from the HIV-positive paner gets into the bloodstream of the HIV-negative paner. HIV is not spread through saliva.",

Non immunized persons may therefore, be immunized. Thus wide spread 'heard immunity' results even if only 66% of community is immunized. This propey of OPV has been exploited in controlling epidemics of polio by administrating the vaccine simultaneously ina sho period to all susceptibles ina community. Live vaccine stimulates antibody formation by inducing mild infection in epithelial cell and the payers patches. Then the virus spreads to the other areas of body and produce antibody. which prevent dissemination of the virus to the nesvus tissue and paralytic polio. The presence of circulating maternal antibodies may modify the infection created by the attenuated vaccine viruses and reduce both the serum and the gut response. Production of antibodies take some time thats why we cant get quick response. Ref: Park 22nd ed/p 187.",

Two safe and effective vaccines are now licensed and available: - 1. The Vi polysachharide vaccine It is composed of purified Vi capsular polysaccharide from the Ty2 strain of S. Typhi. It is administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Only one dose is required. The vaccine confers protection 7 days after injection. To maintain protection, re-vaccination is recommended every 3 years. The vaccine is licensed for individuals aged 2 years. - It does not elicit immune response in children < 2 years. The vaccine is stable for 6 months at 37deg C and for 2 years at 20degC. The recommended storage temprature is 2-8degC. The Vi polysaccharide vaccine can be co-administered with other vaccines relevant for international travellers-such as yellow fever and hepatitis A Acyclovir is given to prevent the development of systemic disease in varicella infected immunosuppresed patients & can halt the progression of zoster in adults. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin given within 72 hrs of exposure can prevent chicken pox and is recommended in exposed immunocompromised persons. A live attenuated varicella vaccine is recommended for children between 12-18 months. It is effective even if given within 3-5 days after exposure. 2. The Ty 21a oral vaccine It is an orally administered, live attenuated Ty2 strain of S. Typhi in which multiple genes (including for Vi Capsular polysaccharide) have been mutated chemically. This lyophilized vaccine is available in 2 preparations:? 1. Enteric coated capsules - Used for travellers to developing countries. It is used in individuals 5 years of age. 2. Liquid suspension - Used by public health programmes for young children in developing countries. It can be administered from the age of 2 years. Vaccine is administered on 1, 3 and 5the day, i. e., a 3-dose regimen is recommended. Vaccine confers protection 7 days after the last dose. The recommendation is to repeat this series (3 doses) every 3 years for people living in endemic areas, and every year for individuals travelling from non-endemic to endemic countries. Ty 21 a requires storage at 2-8degC, it retains potency for approximately 14 days at 25degC. Proguanil and antibacterial drugs should be stopped from 3 days before until 3 days after giving Ty 21 a, as these drugs may harm live bacteria. The vaccine is not efficacious if administered at the time of ongoing diarrhea. Avoided during diarrhoea as efficacy will reduce. Can be given to HIV +ve, asymptomatic persons with CD4 cell count of > 200/mm3 Well tolerated and has low rates of adverse events. Not recommended in congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, acute febrile illness, acute intestinal infection and in patients on antimitotic drugs May be given simultaneously with live vaccines of polio, cholera, yellow fever and MMR.",

If the standard detion (SD) of the EAR is available and the requirement for the nutrient is normally distributed, the RDA is set at 2 SDs above the EAR. RDA EAR 4- 2 SDFAR Adequate intake (AD o The adequate intake is set instead of an RDA if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to calculate an EAR. o The AI is based on observed or experimentally determined estimates of average nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of healthy people. o For example. the \"adequate intake\" for young infants for whom human milk is the recommended sole source of food for the first 4 to 6 months, is based on the estimated daily mean nutrient intake supplied by human milk for healthy, full term infants who are exclusively breastfed. RIM Vs Adequate intakes (Al) Although RDA and Al are used for the same purpose - setting goals for intake by individuals - The RDA differs from the Al. RDA is expected to meet the needs of 97 to 98% of the individuals, while it is not known what percentage of individuals arc covered by the adequate intake. o The adequate intake does not bear a consistent relationship to the EAR or the RDA because it is set without being able to estimate the average requirement. It is assumed that adequate intake is at or above the RDA if one could be calculated. o The adequate intake for a nutrient is expected to exceed the average requirement for that nutrient, and it should cover the needs for more than 98% of the individuals, but it might cover the needs of far fewer. o The degree to which adequate intake exceeds the average requirements is likely to differ among nutrients and population groups. For people with diseases that increases requirements or who have other special health needs, the RDA and adequate intake may serve as the basis for adjusting individual recommendations, qualified health professionals should adapt the recommended intake to cover the higher or lower needs.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., 1-Level of significance First read about these different terms:? Confidence interval It is the interval within which a parameter value is expected to lie with ceain confidence levels, as could be revealed by repeated samples. o It is the interval (range) around the mean of population in which the means of multiple samples of same population are dispersed. o If independent samples are taken repeatedly from the same population, and a confidence interval is calculated, then a ceain percentage (confidence level) of the intervals will include the unknown population parameter. o For example 95% of sample means will be covered by 2. SD from population mean here. Confidence level --> 95%. 95% confidence interval for population mean --> Mean +- 2. SD. o A narrow confidence interval is always preferable as it tells more precisely about the population mean:-- i) Large the sample size, narrower the confidence interval. ii) Smaller the Standard detion, narrower the confidence interval. Confidence limits o Are the upper and lower boundries of confidence interval, i. e., the values which define the range of confidence interval. Confidence limits is calculated by mean and standard detion. I am giving a very simple example:? o If mean weight of a sample of children in a school is 30 Kg and SD is 1. Then. i) Confidence interval = Mean +- 2. SD = 30 +- 2 = 28 to 32 kg. ii) Confidence level = 95% (that means 95% of values will be covered under the range 38 to 32). iii) Confidence limit = 28 (lower limit) and 32 (upper limit) Level of significance Level of significance is the criterian used to rejecting null hypothesis, i. e., to find out significant difference between two variable. o In simple words, it is defined as the probability of making a decision to reject the null hypothesis. o The decision is often made by using p value, i. e., p value denotes significance level. P vlalue 0. 01 means that there is 99% of probability of rejecting null hypothesis when it is false, that is there is significant difference between two variable. o The significance level is usually set at 0. 05 (p=0. 05). The smaller the p-value (significance level), the more significant the result said to be. Now explanation for this question is:? Confidence intervals are closely related to statistical significance testing. In many situations, if the point estimate of parameter is 'X', with confidence interval `a-b' at confidence level P, then any value outside this interval (a-b) will be significantly different from X at significance level a =1 - P under the same distributional assumption that were made to generate the confidence interval. o That means, if in an estimtion of second parameter we obsrved a value less than 'a' or greater than 'b' we would reject null hypothesis that the true value of this parameter equaled 'X' at the level of significance. o Conversely, if the estimate of second parameter lay within the interval `a-b', we would be unable to reject the null hypothesis that the parameter equaled 'X'. In consequence, if the estimates of two parameters have a confidence interval at a given P value that do not overlap, it is very likely that the two values are significantly different at the corresponding value of a.",

Methods based on symptoms and signs - Ovulation Method, Billings Method, Cervical Mucus Method These methods are based on the changes in cervical secretions due to the effects of circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone - Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Method Due to the actions of progesterone on the hypothalamus, a woman's body temperature rises slightly after she ovulates (0. 2 to 0. 5 degrees C) and remains elevated until the end of the cycle, until menstruation. Women who use this method must cha their temperature every day, immediately after waking up and before getting out of bed or drinking any liquids. - Sympto-Thermal Method - This method combines several techniques to predict ovulation. It typically includes monitoring and chaing cervical mucus and position and temperature changes on a daily basis and may include other signs of ovulation, such as breast tenderness, back pain, abdominal pain or \"heaviness, \" or light intermenstrual bleeding. Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) Breastfeeding to achieve contraception, called the lactational amenorrhea method, or LAM, is more than 98% effective during the first 6 months following delivery.",

Based on one criterion or cut-off Based on evaluation of a number of symptoms, signs and point (e. g., diabetes) laboratory findings Less accurate More accurate 6. Less expensive More expensive 7. Not a basis for treatment Used as a basis for treatment 8 The initiative comes from the investigator or agency providing care The initiative comes from a patient with a complaint Criteria for Screening test Screening test must satisfy the criteria of - acceptability - repeatability - validity - simplicity - safety - rapidity - ease of administration - low cost 1. Acceptability - Considering that screening tests are applied on asymptomatic people in large numbers, a high rate of people cooperation is needed. Thus the tests should be acceptable to the people. In general, tests that are painful, discomfoing or embarrasing (eg. rectal or vaginal examinations) are not likely to be acceptable to the population in mass campaigns. 2. Repeatability (Precision or reproducibility) - means that the test must give consistent results when repeated more than once on the same individual or material under the same conditions. 3. Low cost - A screening should be inexpensive. As a screening test has to be applied on millions of people to identify a small percentage who have early disease or its precursors, an expensive test however good, cannot justify use of restricted financial resources that has to be used for fuher diagnostic workup and t/t of those screened on positives. 4. High safety margin - This is an attribute of any test, whether diagnostic or screening. Moresoever for screening as screening tests are to be applied on millions of asymptomatic people and any adverse effect would bring whole process into disrepute. iims IN/nee answers & explanations -- May 2007 5. Validity - It expresses the ability of a test to separate or distinguish those who have the disease from those who do not - Validity has two components - sensitivity & specificity - An ideal screening test should be both highly sensitive and highly specific. But this is seldom possible and a compromise has always to be made.",

Cost-effectiveness analysis is distinct from cost-benefit analysis, which assigns a monetary value to the measure of effect. Cost-effectiveness analysis is often used in the field of health services, where it may be inappropriate to monetize health effect. Typically the CEA is expressed in terms of a ratio where the denominator is a gain in health from a measure (years of life, premature bihs aveed, sight-years gained) and the numerator is the cost associated with the health gain. The most commonly used outcome measure is quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Cost-utility analysis is similar to cost-effectiveness analysis.",

Mechanism of action of slow sand filter o Slow sand tiller work through the formation of a gelatinous layer called vital layer or hypogea I layer or Sch mu tzdecke in the top few cm of sand layer. o This layer is formed in the first 10-20 days of operation. o The formation of vital layer is known as \"Ripening of the filter\". o This vital layer consists of bacteria. fungi. Protozoa, and a range of aquatic insect larvae. o As waste passes through vital layer, paicles of foreign matter arc trapped in the mucilagenous matrix and dissolved organic material is absorbed and metabolized by bacterial, fungi and protoza --> Vital layer has mechanical (physical) as well as biological action. o So, the vital later acts as the hea of slow sand filter.",

C: Lime and then alum Nalgonda technique involves addition of 2 chemicals (lime and alum) in sequence followed by flocculation, sedimentation and filtration The Nalogonda technique It is named after the village in India where the method was pioneered It employs flocculation principle Nalgonda technique is a combination of several unit operations and the process invloves rapid mixing, chemical interaction, floculation, sedimentation, filtration, disinfection and sludge concentration to recover waters and aluminium salts. Alum (hydrated aluminium salts) - a coagulant commonly used for water treatment is used to flocculate fluoride ions in the water. Since the process is best carried out under alkaline conditions, lime is added. For the disinfection purpose bleaching powder is added. After thorough stirring, the chemical elements coagulate into flocs and settle down in the bottom. Salient features of Nalgonda technique No regeneration of media No handling of caustic acids and alkalis Readily available chemicals used in conventional municipal water treatment are only required Adaptable to domestic use Applicable in batch as well as in continuous operation to suit needs simplicity of design, construction, operation and maintenance Local skills could be readily employed Higly efficient removal of fluorides from 1. 5 to 20 mg/ L to desirable levels Simultaneous removal of color, odor, turbidity, bacteria and organic contaminants Normally associated alkalinity ensures fluoride removal efficiency Sludge generated is conveible to alum for use elsewhere Little wastage of water and least disposal problem Needs minimum of mechanical and electrical equipment No energy except muscle power for domestic equipment Economical - annual cost of defluoridation (1991 basis) of water at 401pcd works out to Rs. 20/- for domestic treatment and Rs. 85/- for community treatment using fill and draw system based on 5000 population for water with 5 mg/ L and 400 mg/ L alkalinity which requires 600 mg/ L alum dose. Provides defluoridated water of uniform acceptable quality Disadvantages: Fluoride elimination rate is low (70 - 80%) The right amounts of chemicals need to be added Residual aluminium in the water is a constant danger High sulphate concentrations in the water make it taste salty.

However, with advances in the scientific knowledge regarding the roles of nutrients in human health, the Institute of Medicine (TOM) developed a new set of dietary reference standards--Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)--to replace and expand the RDAs. Its applications include: Composition of diets for schools, prisons, hospitals or nursing homes. Industries developing new food stuffs. Healthcare policy makers and public health officials. The current Dietary Reference Intake recommendation is composed of: Estimated Average Requirements (EAR), expected to satisfy the needs of 50% of the people in that age group. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), the daily dietary intake level of a nutrient considered sufficient to meet the requirements of nearly all (97-98%) healthy individuals in each life-stage and gender group.

It can be caused by decreased intake of niacin or tryptophan, and possibly by excessive intake of leucine. It may also result from alterations in protein metabolism in disorders such as carcinoid syndrome. A deficiency of the amino acid lysine can lead to a deficiency of niacin as well, meaning that another potential cause of pellagra is lysine deficiency",

        "question": "Not true about experimental study -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Unethical to use in animal Experimental epidemiology (Epidemiological Experiments) Experimental epidemiology is also called trial. Broadly speaking, a trial refers to putting something to a test. This allows the term to be used in reference to a test of a treatment for the sick or a test of a preventive measure intended to ave illness, injury or disease. Therefore, the defining feature of an experimental study is its ability to allocate or assign interventions or treatment to experiment unit. In simple words, the study of a treatment (Drugs, surgical intervention) or preventive measure (e. g. vaccination) on living subjects is known as experimental study or trial. Assignment of treatments may be based on i) Randomization In randomized controlled trials ii) Non-randmization trails There are following types of experimental trials 1. Clinical trials: Used to evaluate treatment for people who are ill (e. g. a clinical trial of a chemotherapeutic agent) 2. Field trails: Used to evaluate interventions to prevent disease in healthy people (e. g. a field trial of a vaccine). 3. Community trial: Used to evaluate community-wide intervention (e. g. a community trail of the effects of fluoridation of public water supply). 4. Animal Study: When clincial trails are done on animals (instead of human) is called animal study. In an experimental study, the investigator assign individuals in experimental group and reference group and then follows the two groups for the outcome of interests. Therefore, experimental study is prospective study. Before staing any experimental study the approval of ethics committee is required. The poocol of study is submitted to ethics committee and ethics committee gives approval to the studies which are ethical. So, all experimental studies are considered ethical (after taking approval of ethics committee). There are fewer ethical restrains on experimental study in animals than in human. Blinding in experimental study: Blinding is a procedure to avoid bias i) In single blinding, study subjects are not aware of the treatment they are receiving (whether of experimental group treatment or reference group treatment). ii) In double blinding, study subjects as well as investigator are not aware of the treatment study subject are receiving. iii) In Triple blinding, study subjects, investigator as well as analyzer are not aware of the treatment study subjects are receiving. It is not always possible to do blinding. For example in a trial of surgical intervention, the surgeon and the patient will always know about the surgical procedure as it is necessary to explain the patient to take consent for surgery. Of course, in animal study, the animals do not have awareness or expectancies about their assignment to experimental or reference group. So, we do not use terms single blinding and double blinding. In animal study, when the investigator is not aware of which subjects are in which experiments group, it is simply called a blind study. Interim analysis An interim analysis is the assessment of data during follow up stages of a study for the purpose of assessing the performance of the study. If there is convincing enough evidence to say that there is a significance large treatment difference, study can be stopped at a point earlier than the planned end point. Therefore, interim analysis is also known as 'data dependent stopping' or 'early stopping' There are two main reasons for early stopping of study (interim analysis): 1. Ethical: We want to make sure that the maximum number of patients receive the most effective treatment at the earliest stage. So, if we have convincing evidence that the treatment of study has significant treatment difference, study is closed early and the treatment can be approved so that other patients (in outside world) can receive effective treatment early. 2. Economic: We do not want to spend extra money if we already have enough evidence (in interim analysis) to stop study early. Since clinical trials are expensive, interim analysis can reduce the expenditure by shoening of follow up time needed to make a conclusion.",

Fluorosis is the most common cause of dental caries in children endemic Fluorosis o Endemic fluorosis occurs when drinking water contains increased amounts of fluorine (3-5 mg/L) o Various toxic manifestations of endemic fluorosis are: a. Dental fluorosis Fluoride is deposited in the enamel of teeth when excess fluoride is ingested during the years of tooth calcification (i. e. during the first 7 yrs of life) q Earliest signs of dental fluorosis is molting of dental enamel. The teeth loose their shine and chalk white patches develop. Later the white patches turn yellow or sometimes brown or black. In severe cases, loss of enamel gives the teeth a corroded appearance. Mottling is best seen on the upper incisors. Mottling is almost entirely confined to the permanent teeth and develops only during the period of formation. b. Skeletal fluorosis Chronic ingestion of excessive amount of fluorine (3. 0 to 6. 0 mg/L or more) results in skeletal fluorosis. There is a heavy fluoride deposition in the skeleton. Fluoride deposition leads to Osteosclerosis & calcification of the ligaments. In the early clinical stage of skeletal fluorosis, symptoms include pains in the bones and joints; sensations of burning. pricking. and tingling in the limbs; muscle weakness; chronic fatigue: and gastrointestinal disorders and reduced appetite. In the next clinical stage, pain in the bones become constant and some of the ligaments begin to calcify. Osteoporosis may occur in the long bones, and early symptoms of osteosclerosis are present. Stiffness In the back occurs, especially in the lumbar region, followed by dorsal and cervical spines. Restriction of the spine movements is the earliest clinical sign of fluorosis. The stiffness increases steadily until the entire spine becomes one continuous column of bone manifesting a condition referred to as 'poker hack'. The stiffness that first appears in the spine soon spreads to various joints in the limbs owing to the involvement of the joint capsules, the related ligaments, and the tendinous attachments to the bones. The involvement of the ribs gradually reduces the movement of the chest during breathing. which finally becomes mainly abdominal. When that happens the chest assumes a barrel shape. With the increasing immobilization of the joints due to contractures, flexion deformities may develop at hips, knees and other joints, which make the patient bedridden. Despite the fact that the entire bone structure has become affected, the mental faculties remain unimpaired till the last stage is reached. la The stage at which skeletal fluorosis becomes crippling usually occurs between 30 and 50 years of age in the endemic regions c. Genu valgum In recent years, a new form of fluorosis characterised by genu valgum and osteoporosis of the lower limbs has been repoed from some districts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. This form of fluorosis was observed in people whose staple diet was Sorghum (jov*ar). It was found that diets based on sorghum promoted a higher retention of ingested fluoride than do diets based on rice.",

        "exp": "Coefficient of variance Coefficient of variance indicates how large standard deviation is relative to mean, i. e. Coefficient of variance is a relative comparison of a standard deviation to its mean. It is expressed as percentage. CV = Standard deviation / mean x 100 For example, if the standard deviation of a sample is 8 and the sample mean is 44. The CV will be 18. 2%. That means the standard deviation is 18. 2% of the value of mean. Significance of coefficient of variance CV is a measure used to Compare relative variability when the mean is different in sample to be compared or in character (variables) to be compared - CV compares variability of two different characteristics (e. g., BP, Serum creatinine, height, weight etc.) in the same group of subjects. In this situation mean BP of the sample will have different value (e. g., 120) and mean creatinine level will have different value (e. g., 0. 8) in the same group (sample). CV can compare variability of the same character in two or more different groups (samples). For example taking the height in a group from India and in other group from USA. Both the samples will have different mean height. In these situations, when the mean is different for characteristics to be compared, CV is used to compare the relative variability. Taking the example of given question: CV for BP in a group is 20%. CV for serum creatinine in the same group is 15%. That means for BP, standard deviation is 20% of the mean; and for creatinine, standard deviation is 15% of the mean. It has already been explained that standard deviation is measure of variation (deviation). Therefore, in the given question variability is more in BP than in serum creatinine value. So, Coefficient of variance is used to compare variability of two different characteristic in same group or to compare variability of the same character in different groups (as the mean is different in both these situations). Since coefficient of variance is a ratio, it has no units of measurement (dimensionless). It can be used to compare variability irrespective of the units of measurement used in two or more different group. For example It can compare variability if height measures as cm in one group & inches in another group. About option 'c & d' We cannot comment on standard deviation by knowing just only the coefficient of variance because we don't know the mean BP and mean creatinine level of the sample group -> In three related variables (Here CV, SD & mean) you must know the value of two variables to comment on value of the third one. However, in this question we can say that the standard deviation relative to mean is large for BP than for serum creatinine. So, we cannot comment on absolute value of standard deviation (whether SD of BP is more or SD of creatinine is more), But we can comment on standard deviation relative to mean.",

These children if they tend to have refractive errors, are then referred to the health assistants and ophthalmologists. The National Programme for Control of Blindness was staed in the year 1986 - 1989 in collaboration with WHO with the main aim of reducing the prevalence of blindness from 1. 4% to 0. 3% of population by 2000 AD. By this programme it was facilitated to provide comprehensive health care facilities for primary, secondary and teiary levels of eye health care. According to the NPCB, the major causes of blindness in India are cataract, trachoma, smallpox, infections, injuries, vitamin A deficiency, glaucoma, aphakia, refractive errors, central corneal opacification and posterior segment disorders. The objectives of National Programme for Control of Blindness are as follows: 1. Through mass communication and extensive education programmes, people were to be educated about eye health care. 2. Ceain units of eye care facilities were established in order to restore sight and allete eye ailments. 3. As a pa of general health services, at peripheral, central and intermediate levels various permanent eye health care centres were established.

Mechanism of actions of IUDs 1) Most accepted Induce a foreign - body reaction that results in chronic inflammatory reaction --> cellular and biochemical changes in the endometrium and uterine fluids. These changes impair the bility of the gamete and thus reduce its chances of feilization rather than its implantation. \"IUDs prevent feilization primarily by interfering with the ability of sperm to survive and to ascend the fallopion tubes, where feilization curs\". Reaserch aicles \"Whatever the IUD's specific mechanism of action, it appears that the IUD effectively interrupts the reproductive process of implantation \". 2) In medicated IUDs, copper enchances the cellular response in the endometrium. By altering the biochemical composition of cervical mucus, copper ions may affect sperm motility, capaciation and survival. Hormone - releasing devices increase the viscosity of cervical mucus and thereby prevent sperm from entering the cervix. They also maintain high level of progesterone in the endometrium and thus, relatively low levels of estrogen, thereby sustaining an endometrium unourable to implantation.",

Incubation period of some pathogens are: Varicella (Chickenpox) - usually 14 to 16 days Measles (Rubeola) - usually 10 days from exposure to onset of fever, and 14 days to appearance of rash Rubella (German Measles) - 2 to 3 weeks; usually 18 days Mumps - 2 to 3 weeks; usually 18 days Influenza - 18 to 72 hours Diphtheria - 2 to 6 days Peussis - usually 7 to 14 days, but not more than 3 weeks Meningiococcal Meningitis - usually 3 to 4 days. but may vary from 2 to 10 days Tuberculosis - the time from receipt of infection to the development of a positive tuberculin test ranges from 3 to 6 weeks, and thereafter, the development of disease depends upon the closeness of contact, extent of the disease and sputum positivity of the source case and host parasite relationship. Thus the incubation period of tuberculosis varies from weeks, months or years. Polio - usually 7 to 14 days Hepatitis A - 15 to 45 days (usually 25 to 30 days) Hepatitis B - 45 to 180 days Hepatitis C - 40 to 120 days Cholera - from few hours up to 5 days, but commonly 1- 2 days Typhoid - usually 10 - 14 days, but it may be as sho as 3 days or as long as 3 weeks depending on the dose of bacilli ingested. Amoebiasis - 2 to 4 weeks Ascariasis - about 2 months Filariasis - 8 to 16 months Rabies - highly variable from 4 days to many years but usually 3- 8 weeks Yellow fever - 3 to 6 days (6 days recognized under International Health Regulations)",

        "question": "Admission rate bias is?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Berksonian bias Selection bias Selection biases are distoion that result from procedure used to select subjects and from factors that influence study paicipation. Groups to be compared are differentially susceptible to the outcome even before the experimental maneuver is performed. Selation bias may be of following types. 1. Surveillance/detection bias A potential aifact in epidemiologic data caused by the use of a paicular diagnostic technique or type of equipment. For example, cancer rates may vary in different regions or periods, not because of an actual difference in the incidence of disease but because of different diagnostic technologies. If diagnostic test is being used in one region is more sensitive than other region, the cancer rates will be high in that region even without the existance of an actual difference. 2. Neyman survival bias (Incidence-Prevalence bias) This type of bias is due to missing of fatal cases, mild cases or cases of shoer duration from the study. For example, in a study of breaset cancer, we can choose two different types of cases:? Incident cases - All breast cancer patients newly diagnosed during a given time. Prevalent cases - All breast cancer patients who are alive during a given time frame. These can lead to different results, because the probability of finding a case in given time frame is related to moality risk. Those patients who hay a mild form of disease and survive for a relatively long time have a good chance of being around on the date of data collection. Those patients who die quickly are unlikely to be around on that date. 3. Referrel bias or volunteer bias Volunteer or referral bias occurs because people who volunteer to paicipate in a study (or who are referred to it) are often different than non-volunteers/non referrel. This bias usually ors the treatment group, as volunteers tend to be more motivated and concerned about there health. 4. Response bias Occurs when those who respond to a survey differ in impoant ways from those who do not respond. This bias can work in either direction, i. e., if bias occurs, when those who do not respond to a survey differ in impoant ways from those who respond, it is called nonrespondent bias. 5. Berkesonian bias Berksonian bias results from the greater probability of hospital admission for people with two or more disease than for people with one disease. So, it is also known as admission rate bias. For example, If breast cancer is the exposure of interest (diseases are often treated as exposures in hospital based case-control studies) and meningioma is the case disease then people with both breast cancer and meningioma could be hospitalized for either breast cancer or mengioma or both. However, people with only breast cancer or with only mengioma could be hospitalized because of one of these disease. Therefore, a greater propoion of people in the community with both breast cancer and meningioma would be admitted to the hospital than would people with meningioma only. So, Berksonian bias occurs when both exposure (e. g., breast cancer in above example) and disease (e. g., meningioma in above example) affect selection.",

        "question": "Which of the following statements about Delphi method is true -",
        "exp": "Delphi method Delphi method is a systemic, interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of independent experts. The first round of the delphi method essentially involves development of a questionnaire that are posted to members of the team experts. The carefully selected experts answer questionnaires in two or more rounds. After each round, a facilitator provides an anonymous summary of the experts forecasts from the previous round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgment. Thus, experts are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies of other members of the panel. It is believed that during this process the range of the answers will decrease and the group will converge towards the \"correct\" answer. Finally, the process is stopped after a pre-defined stop criterion (e. g. number of rounds, stability of results) and the mean and median scores of the final rounds determine the results. Principal of Delphi Delphi is based on the principal that forecast from a structured group of experts are more accurate than those from unstructured groups or individuals. The technique can be adapted for use in face-to-face meetings, and is then called mini-Delphi or Estimale - Talk - Estimate (ECE). Delphi has been widely used for business forecasting and has certain advantages over another structured forecasting approach called, prediction markets. Key characteristics of Delphi method The following key characteristics of the Delphi method help the participant to focus on the issues at hand and separate Delphi from other methodology - 1. Structuring of information flow The initial contributions from the experts are collected in the form of answer of questionnaires and their comments to these answers. The panel director controls the interactions among the participants by processing the information and filtering out irrelevant content. This avoids the negative effects of face-to-face panel discussion and solves the usual problems of group dynamics. 2. Regular feedback Participants comment on their own forecasts, the responses of others and on the progress of the panel as a whole. At any moment they can revise their earlier statements. While in regular group meetings participants tend to stick to previously stated opinions and often conform too much to group leader, the Delphi methods prevents it. 3. Anonymity of the participants Usually all participants maintain anonymity. Their identity is not revealed even after the completion of the final report. This stops them from dominating others in the process using their authority or personality, frees them to some extent from their personal biases, minimizes the \"bandwagan effect\" or \"halo effect\", allows them to freely express their opinions, encourages open critique and admitting errors by revision earlier judgments.",

Touching the fluid blister can also spread the disease. A person with chickenpox is infectious from 1-2 days before the rash appears. The contagious period continues until all blisters have formed scabs, which is about 4 to 5 days after the rash. After the spots have scabbed over, the sufferer is still highly contagious, from 10 to 21 days, meaning they can still spread the virus through close contact, breathing, and even sleeping in someone's bed.

Non-immunized person may therefore, be immunized. Thus widespread herd immunity results, even if only approximately 66% of the community is immunized (100% coverage is not required). Advantages of OPV o Easy to administer o Induces both humoral and intestinal immunity. o Antibody is quickly produced in a large propoion of vacciness, even a single dose elicits substantial immunity. o The vaccine excretes the virus and so infects others who are also immunized thereby. o Useful in controlling epidemics. o Relatively inexpensive. Disadvantages o OPV is a thermolabile vaccine -p maintenance of cold chian is required and vaccine is stored at -20degC in deep freez.

Normal Saline is recommended as diluent for BCG vaccine. The reconstituted vaccine should be used within 3 hours and left over vaccine should be discarded. The Vaccine must not be contaminated with any antiseptic or detergent. If alcohol is used to swab the skin, it must be allowed to evaporate before the vaccine is given.

Other impoant points about BCG Vaccination There are two types of BCG vaccine - the liquid (fresh) vaccine and the freeze - dried vaccine. Presently freeze -dried vaccines being more stable are used. Storage: BCG vaccines are stable for several weeks at ambient temp in a tropical climate, and for up to 1 years if kept away from direct light and stored in a cool environment. The vaccine must be protected from exposure to light during storage (wrapped up in double layers of red or black cloth). Dosage: - Usual strength is 0. 1 mg in 0. 1 ml volume - Dose to newborn aged below 4 weeks is 0. 05 ml Administration: - Intradermal* with tuberculin syringe. Site of injection: - Just above the inseion of the deltoid muscle. Age of administration: - Either at bih or at 6 weeks of age simultaneously with DFT and polio. Duration of protection: - 15 to 20 years. Booster: - Not advised under Expanded Programme of Immunization. Contraindications: - Unless specifically indicated, BCG should not be given to patients suffering from*. - Generalized eczema* - Infective dermatosis* - Hypogammaglobulinaemia* - Patient with history of deficient immunity*.
