Protection of health by personal and community efforts, such as enhancing nutritional status, providingimmunizations, and eliminating environmental risks. Total population, selected groups and individuals at high risk; achieved through public health programmes. Secondary. Early stage of disease. Reduce the prevalence of disease by shortening its duration. Measures available to individuals and communities for early detection and prompt intervention to control disease and minimize disability (e, g. through screening programmes). Individuals with established disease; achieved through early diagnosis and treatment. Tertiary. Late stage of disease (treatment, rehabilitation). Reduce the number and/or impact of complications. Measures aimed at softening the impact of long-term disease and disability; minimizing suffering; maximizing potential years of useful life. Patient achieved through rehabilitation* 'YOGA' is a practice that involves training of the mind, body and breathing to deliver various health benefits, Repular practice of yoga can be best defined as a form of \"Preventive Medicine\" that has shown beneficial effects on several ailments including Backache, Anxiety, Hypertension etc. Health promotion.

Efforts taken to discourage children from adopting harmful habits. Main intervention is through the individual or the mass education. Primary prevention. Action taken prior to the onset of the disease, which removes possibility that a disease will ever occur. Intervention is done in a pre-pathogenesis phase of a disease. It is accomplished by health promotion, promotion of quality of life and specific protection. It is applied to prevention of chronic disease (CAD, hypertension and cancer) based on elimination/modification of the risk factors by two stratergies, namely; Population/mass and High risk. Secondary prevention. Action which halts the progress of disease at its incipient stage and prevents complications. Intervention include early diagnosis and treatment. It is an imperfect tool in control of transmission. Tertiary prevention. When a disease has advanced beyond its early stage, it is still possible to accomplish prevention by tertiary intervention in late pathogenesis phase.

But it was the laboratory researches of Louis Pasteur in the 1860s and then Robe Koch in the following decades that provided the scientific proof for germ theory.

        "exp": "Secondary prevention is the identification and treatment of premalignant or subclinical cancers. Screening by means of mammography is a typical example of secondary prevention. Teiary prevention is defined as symptoms control and rehabilitation. Screening for breast cancer There is evidence that screening for breast cancer has a ourable effect on moality from breast cancer. The basic techniques for early detection of breast cancer are: (a} breast self-examination (BSE) by the patient (b) palpation by a physician (c) thermography (d) mammography. All women should be encouraged to perform breast self- examination. Breast cancers are more frequently found by women themselves than by a physician during a routine examination. Although the effectiveness of BSE has not been adequately quantified, it is a useful adjuvant to early case detection. In many countries, BSE will probably be the only feasible approach to wide population coverage for a long time to come. Palpation is unreliable for large fatty breasts. Thermography has the advantage that the patient is not exposed to radiation. Unfounately, it is not a sensitive tool. Mammography is most sensitive and specific in detecting small tumours that are sometimes missed on palpation. The use of mammography has three potential drawbacks: (i) exposure to radiation. This may amount to a dose of 500 milliroentgen compared to a 30-40 milliroentgen dose received in chest X-ray. Therefore, there has been concern about exposure to radiation from repeated mammographies and the risk of breast cancer developing as a result (ii) mammography requires technical equipment of a high standard and radiologists with very considerable experience - these two factors limit its more widespread use for mass screening purposes, and (iii) biopsy from a suspicious lesion may end up in a false-positive in as many as 5-10 cases for each case of cancer detected. Although recent evidence points to the superiority of mammography over clinical examination in terms of sensitivity and specificity, medical opinion is against routine mammography on the very young. Women under 35 years of age should not have X-rays unless they are symptomatic or a family history of early onset of breast cancer Ref: Park 23rd edition Pgno: 387",

Ergot is the dried sclerotium (compact mycelium or spawn) of the parasitic fungus Claviceps purpurea, which grows on cereals like rye, barley, wheat, oats, etc. (principally on rye and barely in wet seasons and in ill-drained soils.) It gradually invades the interior of the cereal/grain, producing a curved, dark-purple or black compact mass called sclerotium. It contains about thiy alkaloids, but ergotoxin, ergotamine, and ergometrine are impoant. Ergotoxin promotes contraction of the uterus in later months of pregnancy.

        "exp": "Ans. d (Infant mortality rate) (Ref. Park PSM 22nd/pg. 23, 525). Infant Mortality Rate# The probability of dying in the period from birth to the first birthday.# In reality, newborns are not prospectively observed for deaths occurring up to 1 year of age. Instead, the probability of dying is calculated on the basis of the number of reported infant deaths during a calendar year divided by the estimated number of live births occurring in the same year.# Although it is actually a ratio, the IMR is presented as a \"rate\" per 1000 live births. LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BERTH# The number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of age-specific mortality rates at the time of birth were to stay the same throughout the child's life.# Life expectancy at birth reflects the overall mortality level of a population.# It summarizes the mortality pattern that prevails across all age groups - children and adolescents, adults and the elderly. TOTAL FERTILITY RATE# Number of births that a woman can expect to have during her childbearing years (15-49 years), given current age- specific fertility rates in her population or country.# The TFR is therefore the sum of all age-specific fertility rates at one point in time. HEALTHY LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH# Average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\" by taking into account years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury.# Substantial resources are devoted to reducing the incidence, duration and severity of major diseases that cause morbidity but not mortality and to reducing their impact on people's lives.# It is important to capture both fatal and non-fatal health outcomes in a summary measure of average levels of population health.# Healthy life expectancy (HALE) at birth adds up expectation of life for different health states, adjusted for severity distribution making it sensitive to changes over time or differences between countries in the severity distribution of health states. Under-five Mortality Rate# Probability that a newborn child will die before reaching his or her fifth birthday (the sum of probabilities of dying in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth years of life).# This cumulative probability is expressed per 1000 live births.# It is meant to estimate the likelihood at the time of birth that a child will not survive to his or her fifth birthday.# Under-5 mortality rate is a leading indicator of the level of child health and overall development in countries.# It is also an MDG indicator. Maternal Mortality Ratio# Maternal death is defined as the death of a woman as a result of pregnancy or childbirth, during pregnancy or within 42 days after delivery.# Classification of a death as a maternal death is highly dependent on a recorded diagnosis or the conduct of a verbal autopsy to ascertain the cause of death.# In practice, the MMR is often an estimate based solely upon the time of death, i. e., death while pregnant or within 42 days after delivery.# The MMR is expressed as the number of maternal deaths per 100, 000 live births over a specified period. This is a measure of the risk of death once a woman has become pregnant.# The Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) defines a maternal death as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.# Most common cause of maternal mortality in India is PPH.",
