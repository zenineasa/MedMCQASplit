The validity of the vaccination certificate begins 10 days after the date of vaccination and extends upto 10 years.o Diluent used for reconstitution is cold physiological saline and reconstituted vaccine should be used within 30 minutes. Cold chain temperature for storage is -30deg to +5degC.o Yellow fever vaccine is the only live vaccine that can be given in pregnancy, if required. Yellow fever and cholera vaccine cannot be given together, a minimum gap of 3 weeks is required between the two.",

Reverse genetics' is an approach to discovering the function of a gene by analyzing the phenotypic effects of specific gene sequences obtained by DNA sequencing. This investigative process proceeds in the opposite direction of so- called forward genetic screens of classical genetics. Simply put, while forward genetics seeks to find the genetic basis of a phenotype or trait, reverse genetics seeks to find what phenotypes arise as a result of particular genes.",
