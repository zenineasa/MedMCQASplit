Before use ,the lyophilised vaccine is reconstituted with sterile diluent. Diluent must be cooled before reconstitution but it should not be freezed.After reconstitution , vaccine must be stored in dark at 2-8 degree celcius and used within 4 hrs. Each dose if 0.5 ml contains > 1000 viral infective units of vaccine strain. Measles vaccine may also contain sorbitol and hydrolysed gelatin as stabilizers and neomycin but it doesn&;t have thiomersal. Age-before 9 months.The age can be lowered to 6 months if there is measles outbreak in community.For infants immunised between 6 and 9 months,second dose administered as soon as possible after the child reaches 9 months provided that at least 4 weeks have elapsed since the last dose. Route-subcutaneous/intramuscular. Immune response- both humoral and cellular. Contraindications- High fever,pregnancy, history of anaphylactic reaction to vaccine components, immunocompromised individuals, leukemia, lymphoma,severe HIV( early stage of HIV is not a contraindication), treatment with steroids, antimetabolites and serious malignancy. Adverse reactions:- TSS-toxic shock syndrome. Occurs when measles vaccine is contaminated or when the same l is used more than once on same day / next day. The vaccine should not be used after 4 hrs of reconstitution. Symptoms of TSS : severe watery diarrhoea, vomiting, high fever repoed within few hours after vaccination. TSS is totally preventable and reflects poor quality of immunisation. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.149}</p>",

        "question": "Most efficient ani-larval measure to prevent urban malaria is",
        "exp": "Anti-larval measures of plasmodium (i) Larvicides : During the first half of the 20th century, anti-larval measures such as oiling the collections of standing water or dusting them with paris green effectively controlled malaria (but the measures were eclipsed at the end of World War II). With the increase in insecticide resistance, the older methods of mosquito control have now become promising. Some modern larvicides such as temephos which confer long effect with low toxicity are more widely used. However larviciding must be repeated at frequent intervals and for this reason it is a comparatively costly operation. (ii) Source reduction : Techniques to reduce mosquito breeding sites (often called source reduction) which include drainage or filling, deepening or flushing, management of water level, changing the salt content of water and intermittent irrigation are among the classical methods of malaria control to which attention is being paid again. Whenever practicable, measures for the improvement of the environment by the permanent reduction of sources should be instituted. {iii) Integrated control : In order to reduce too much dependance on residual insecticides, increasing emphasis is being put on \"integrated\" vector control methodology which includes bioenvironmental and personal protection measure .This approach is impoant because there is no single and simple method that would ensure control of transmission. By mid 1995 all malaria endemic countries in the region had adopted the revised malaria control strategy to reduce morbidity and moality and to reduce its area of distribution, paicularly of multidrug resistant malaria. The use of stratification approach by the majority of anti-malaria programmes in the Region has led to more cost-effective interventions. Vector resistance to insecticides has necessitated the use of more expensive pyrethroid, thereby limiting the coverage. Malaria control added impetus as Roll Back Malaria initiative was launched by WHO, UNICEF, UNDP and the World Bank in 1998.",

Clinically characterised by insidious onset with mild fever and an irritating cough, gradually becoming paroxysmal with the characteristic whoop often with cyanosis and vomiting. Also known as \"Hundred day cough\". AGENT FACTORS:- 1. Agent-B.peussis. Small percentage of case are caused by B.parapeussis, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus. 2. Source of infection- B.peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&;t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&;t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B.parapeussis. Mode of transmission:- Mainly by droplet infection and direct contact. Each time the patient coughs,sneezes or talks, the bacilli are sprayed into the air. The role of fomites in the spread of disease appears to be very small , unless they are freshly contaminated. Incubation period-7-14 days , but not more than 3 weeks. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.167}</p>",

Guineaworm disease is a totally water-based disease and does not have an alternate pathway of transmission. Treatment No drug cures the infection but metronidazole and mebendazole are sometimes used to limit inflammation and facilitate worm removal. Wet compresses may relieve discomfo. Occlusive dressings improves hygiene and limit shedding of infectious larvae. Worms are removed by sequentially rolling them out over a small stick.

Source of infection- B.peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&;t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions.

Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age.

Source of infection- B.peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&;t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&;t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B.parapeussis.

SEVERE PNEUMONIA Most impoant sign to consider when deciding if the child has pneumonia are the RR and chest indrawing. A child with chest indrawing may not have fast breathing if the child becomes exhausted. Then the breathing slows down. Un such cases chest indrawing may be the only sign in a child with severe pneumonia. Other signs: 1. Nasal flare 2. Grunting 3. Cyanosis 4. Wheezing Treatment:- Refer urgently to hospital. Give first dose antibiotics. Treat fever and wheeze if present. PMEUMONIA:- 1. Fast breathing 2. No chest indrawing Treatment:- Advice mother to give home care. Give an antibiotic. Treat fever and wheeze if present. Advice mother to return eith child in 2 days for reassessment, or earlier if child gets worse. No pneumonia:- 1. Simple cough or cold.

Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 mOsm/l improved the efficacy of ORS regimen for children with acute non cholera diarrhoea.

        "exp": "<p>ORS Aim of oral rehydration therapy is to prevent dehydration and reduce moality. Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 mOsm/l improved the efficacy of ORS regimen for children with acute non cholera diarrhoea.

        "exp": "VECTOR CONTROL STRATEGIES Vector control is still one of the primary weapons to control malaria in endemic areas. (a) Anti-adult measures (i) Residual spraying : The discovery of DDT in 1940s and followed by other insecticides revolutionized malaria control. The spraying of the indoor surfaces of houses with residual insecticides (e.g., DDT, malathion, fenitrothion) is still the most effective measure to kill the adult mosquito. It has been observed that discontinuation of spraying has very often led to the resurgence of malaria. This implies that spraying once applied may need to be continued for an indefinite period. If indoor spraying is to have any effect, then exhaustive coverage is needed. Indoor house spraying Reduces the longevity of the vector. Malathion and fenitrothion are organophosphate insecticides which are being used with increasing frequency For malaria control following the development of vector resistance to DDT (ii) Space application : This is a major anti-epidemic measure in mosquito-borne diseases. It involves the application of pesticides in the form of fog or mist using special equipment. The ultra-low-volume method of pesticide dispersion by air or by ground equipment has proved to be effective and economical. Outdoor space sprays reduce vector population quickly. {iii) Individual protection : Man-vector contact can be reduced by other preventive measures such as the use of repellents, protective clothing, bed-nets* (preferably impregnated with safe, long-acting repellent insecticides), mosquito coils, screening of houses etc. The methods of personal protection are of great value when properly employed.

It is recommended that a dose of OPV is required to be given to all children delivered in the hospital before discharge. Very impoant to complete vaccination before 6 months before most cases occur between 6 months- 3 years. Dose -2 drops Immunity:- prevents paralysis and intestinal reinfection. Thus limits virus transmission in community . The vaccine progeny excreted in faeces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts and susceptible contacts in community. Non immunised persons may therefore become immunised. This propey of OPV has been exploited in controlling epidemic . Advantages:- Antibodies quickly produced and therefore helps to control epidemic. Induces both humoral and intestinal immunity. Easy to administer. Complication:- Vaccine associated paralytic polio in recipients of vaccine and their contacts . Contraindications:- Immunocompromised. Malignancy . Leukemia. Storage-Requires to be stored and transpoed at sub zero temperature,unless stabilized. Problems with OPV:- 1. Instability of vaccine at high temperatures. 2. Frequent vaccine failures. 3. Small residual neurovirulence.

Route-subcutaneous/intramuscular. Immune response- both humoral and cellular. Contraindications- High fever,pregnancy, history of anaphylactic reaction to vaccine components, immunocompromised individuals, leukemia, lymphoma,severe HIV( early stage of HIV is not a contraindication), treatment with steroids, antimetabolites and serious malignancy. Adverse reactions:- TSS-toxic shock syndrome. Occurs when measles vaccine is contaminated or when the same l is used more than once on same day / next day. The vaccine should not be used after 4 hrs of reconstitution. Symptoms of TSS : severe watery diarrhoea, vomiting, high fever repoed within few hours after vaccination.

Incubation period-10 days from exposure to onset of fever and 14 days of appearance of rash. 3 stages:- 1. Prodromal stage. Begins 10 days after infection. Lasts till 14 days. Characterised by fever,coryza with sneezing and nasal discharge, cough, redness of eyes, lacrimation and photophobia. A day or two before the appearance of rash, kopliks spots like table salt like crystal appear on buccal mucosa opposite the first and second lower molars. They are small, bluish white spots on a red base. 2. Eruptive phase Typical dusky red maculopapular rash which begins behind the ear and spreads rapidly in a few hours over the face and neck and extends down the body . Fever and lesion disappear in another 3/4 days signalling the end of disease. During the prodromal phase and first 2-5days of rash, virus present in tears, nasal & throat secretions, urine and blood.The rash appears as a result of interaction of immune T cells with virus infected cells Just as the rash appears- circulating antibodies appear- and fever falls. Diagnosis of measles is based on the typical rash and kopliks spots seen in oral mucosa.In developed countries,IgM antibodies are used for diagnosis. 3. Post measles stage Child lose weight, remain weak for a number of days. There may be a failure to recover and gradual deterioration into chronic illness.There may be growth retardation,diarrhoea,pyogenic infection,candidiasis etc. Age of vaccine administration-before 9 months.The age can be lowered to 6 months if there is measles outbreak in community.For infants immunised between 6 and 9 months,second dose administered as soon as possible after the child reaches 9 months provided that at least 4 weeks have elapsed since the last dose. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.149}</p>",

Clinically characterised by insidious onset with mild fever and an irritating cough, gradually becoming paroxysmal with the characteristic whoop often with cyanosis and vomiting. Also known as \"Hundred day cough\". AGENT FACTORS:- 1. Agent-B.peussis. Small percentage of case are caused by B.parapeussis, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus. 2. Source of infection- B.peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&;t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&;t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B.parapeussis. Mode of transmission:- Mainly by droplet infection and direct contact. Each time the patient coughs,sneezes or talks, the bacilli are sprayed into the air. The role of fomites in the spread of disease appears to be very small , unless they are freshly contaminated. Incubation period-7-14 days , but not more than 3 weeks. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.167}</p>",

Additional doses recommended prior to school entry and then every 5 yrs until the age of 18. Alternatively one/two doses of OPV can be safely given as boosters after an initial course of immunisation with inactivated vaccine. Immunity:- induces circulating humoral antibodies(IgM,IgG,IgA). Doesn&;t induce intestinal or local immunity. The circulating antibodies protect the individual against paralytic polio,but do not prevent reinfection of gut by wild viruses. In case of epidemic, IPV is unsustainable because immunity is not rapidly achieved as more than one dose required to induce immunity and injections are to be avoided during epidemic as they are likely to precipitate paralysis. Advantages:- it doesn&;t contain living virus ,so safe to administer : 1. To persons with immunodeficiency diseases. 2. To persons undergoing coicosteroid and radiation therapy. 3. To those over 50 years who are receiving vaccine for first time. 4. During pregnancy. 5. IPV is an alternative to OPV for immunisation of children with HIV infection.

Characterised by fever,coryza with sneezing and nasal discharge, cough, redness of eyes, lacrimation and photophobia. A day or two before the appearance of rash, kopliks spots like table salt like crystal appear on buccal mucosa opposite the first and second lower molars. They are small, bluish white spots on a red base. 2. Eruptive phase Typical dusky red maculopapular rash which begins behind the ear and spreads rapidly in a few hours over the face and neck and extends down the body . Fever and lesion disappear in another 3/4 days signalling the end of disease. During the prodromal phase and first 2-5days of rash, virus present in tears, nasal & throat secretions, urine and blood.The rash appears as a result of interaction of immune T cells with virus infected cells Just as the rash appears- circulating antibodies appear- and fever falls. Diagnosis of measles is based on the typical rash and kopliks spots seen in oral mucosa.In developed countries,IgM antibodies are used for diagnosis. 3. Post measles stage Child lose weight, remain weak for a number of days. There may be a failure to recover and gradual deterioration into chronic illness.There may be growth retardation,diarrhoea,pyogenic infection,candidiasis etc. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.149}</p>",

WHO recommends the &;Danish 1331&; strain for vaccine production. Stable for several weeks at ambient temperature in a tropical climate and for upto 1 year if kept away from direct light and stored in a cool environment below 10 deg celcius. Vaccine must be protected from light ( wrapped up in a double layer of red/ black cloth). Normal saline is recommended as diluent for reconstituting the vaccine as distilled water may cause irritation. Reconstituted vaccine may be used within 3 hours. Dosage-0.1 mg in 0.1 ml volume. The dose of newborn below 4 weeks is 0.05 ml. Administered intradermally using tuberculin syringe. Injected slightly above the inseion of left deltoid. If injected too high / too low adjacent lymph nodes may become involved and tender. The vaccine must not be contaminated with an antiseptic/detergent. If alcohol is used to swab the skin , it must be allowed to evaporate before the vaccine is given. Phenomenon after vaccination:/ 2-3 weeks after a correct intradermal injection of a potent vaccine, a papule develops at the site of vaccination. It increases slowly in size and reaches a a diameter of about 4-8 mm in 5 weeks. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow ulcer but usually seen covered by a crust. Healing occurs within 6-12weeks leaving a permanent,tiny, round scar (4-8 mm in diameter).This is a normal reaction. Normally the individual become mantoux postive after 8 weeks has elapsed. Adverse reactions: prolonged severe ulceration at the site of vaccination, suppurative lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis and disseminated BCG infection. Contraindications: BCG should not be given to patients with generalised eczema, infective dermatosis, hypogammaglobulinemia , those with history of deficient immunity, patients under immunosuppressive treatment and in pregnancy. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.196}</p>",

        "question": "Which of the following statements about lepromin test is not true -",
        "exp": "LEPROMIN TEST The test is performed by injecting intradermally 0.1 ml of lepromin into the inner aspect of the forearm of the individual. As a routine, the reaction is read at 48 hours and 21 days. Two types of positive reactions have been described: (a) EARLY REACTION : The early reaction is also known as Fernandez reaction. An inflammatory response develops within 24 to 48 hours and this tends to disappear after 3 to 4 days. It is evidenced by redness and induration at the site of inoculation. If the diameter of the red area is more than 10 mm at the end of 48 hours, the test is considered positive. The early positive reaction indicates whether or not a person has been previously sensitized by exposure to and infection by the leprosy bacilli. In this sense, the early reaction is much superior to the late reactfon. The early reaction has been described as delayed hypersensitivity reaction to \"soluble\" constituents of the leprosy bacilli. The reaction corresponds to the Mantoux reaction in tuberculosis, caused by the soluble antigens (PPD) of the tubercle bacilli. (b) LATE REACTION : This is the classical Mitsuda reaction. The reaction develops late, becomes apparent in 7-10 days following the injection and reaching its maximum in 3 or 4 weeks. The test is read at 21 days. At the end of 21 days, if there is a nodule more than 5 mm in diameter at the site of inoculation, the reaction is said to be positive. The nodule may even ulcerate and heal with scarring if the antigen is crude. It may be noted that the diameter of the red area in the early reaction, and the diameter of the nodule in the late reaction are measured. The early reaction is induced by the soluble constituents of the leprosy bacilli; and the late reaction by the bacillary component of the antigen. It indicates cell-mediated immunity. In the first 6 months of life, most children are lepromin negative; some may become positive by the end of first year. Data obtained from different pas of the world indicate that in endemic areas, lepromin reaction is already positive in 20 per cent of children under 5 years of age, and this propoion increases to around 60 per cent or more in the 10-14 years age group, and to 80 per cent or more in persons over 19 years of age. BCG vaccination is capable of conveing the lepra reaction from negative to positive in a large propoion of individuals. Value of the lepromin test Lepromin test is not a diagnostic test. The two drawbacks that stand in the way of this test being used for diagnosis are : (i) positive results in non-cases, and (ii) negative results in lepromatous and near-lepromatous cases. The test has been generally accepted as a useful tool in evaluating the immune status (CMI) of leprosy patients. It is of considerable value in confirming the results ofclassification of cases of leprosy on clinical and bacteriological grounds. In other words, the test is widely used as an aid to classify the type of disease. The test is also of great value in estimating the prognosis in cases of leprosy of all types. The test is usually strongly positive in the typical tuberculoid cases, and the positivity getting weaker as one passes through the spectrum to the lepromatous end, the typical lepromatous cases being lepromin negative indicating a failure of CMI. It is known that lepromin negative individuals are at a higher risk of developing progressive multibacillary leprosy, but those who are lepromin positive either escape the clinical disease (the majority) or develop paucibacillary disease (the minority).
