Contraindications- High fever, pregnancy, history of anaphylactic reaction to vaccine components, immunocompromised individuals, leukemia, lymphoma, severe HIV( early stage of HIV is not a contraindication), treatment with steroids, antimetabolites and serious malignancy. Adverse reactions:- TSS-toxic shock syndrome. Occurs when measles vaccine is contaminated or when the same l is used more than once on same day / next day. The vaccine should not be used after 4 hrs of reconstitution. Symptoms of TSS: severe watery diarrhoea, vomiting, high fever repoed within few hours after vaccination.

It is occasionally transmitted to man by direct or indirect contact with infected animals. There is no evidence of transmission from man to man. Agents - gram negative, non-motile, intracellular coccobacilli. Reservoir of infection. Main reservoirs of human infection are cattle, swine, horses and dogs. In animals brucella can cause abortion, premature expulsion of the fetus or death. Brucella is excreted in urine, milk, placenta and vaginal discharges. Thus brucellosis is predominantly a disease of farmers, shepherds, butchers and abattoir workers & veterinarians. Modes of transmission. Contact infection (Most common)direct contact with infected tissues, blood, urine, vaginal discharge, aborted fetuses and especially placenta. Food borne infectioningestion of raw milk or dairy products from infected animalsfresh raw vegetables can also carry infection if grown on soil containing manure from infected farm. water contaminated with excreta of infected animals also serves as source of infection.

Kolaviron, a natural biflavonoid antioxidant has been extensively investigated for it hepatoprotective, radical scavenging and antigenotoxic properties in vitro and in vivo. Preventative anticarcinogens act by enhancing an organism's natural defences against cancer, by deactivating carcinogens or by blocking the mechanisms by which carcinogens act (such as free radical damage to DNA). Anticarcinoma agents participate in the selective destruction of cancer cells, or inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. There is epidemiological evidence that a diet rich in antioxidant vitamins andflavonoids is anticarcinogenic. Interest in many popular nutritional supplements, including essential antioxidant nutrients such as selenium compounds and hormones such as melatonin and DHEA, is partly motivated by evidence that these have significant anticarcinogenic effects in appropriate quantities.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e. Weil Felix reaction is very useful for diagnosis Q. Fever is caused by a Rickettsia, Coxiella Burnetti. Coxiella burnetti is unique to Rickettsia because it has an endospore form. This endospore form confers properties to the bacteria that differ from other Rickettsiae: Resistance to heat and drying. Extracellular existence:- The spores resistance allows extended survival outside a host cell. However like chlamydiae and other Rickettsiae growth and division must occur intracellularly using the host's ATP. Non arthropod transmission: Coxiella burnetti grows in tick and cattles. The spores remains viable in dried tick faeces deposited on cattle hides and in dried cow placentas. These spores are aerosolized and when inhaled cause human disease. So spore inhalation rather than an arthropod bite causes Q fever. Pneumonia: Because the spores are inhaled into the lungs, a mild pneumonia similar to that of a mycoplasma pneumonia (interstitial pneumonia) often develops. Clinical features are: Abrupt onset of fever and soaking sweats. This is the only rickettsial disease that causes pneumonia and in which there is no rash. Weil Felix is a simple and useful test for the diagnosis of some Rickettsial disease. It is positive in -Epidemic typhus*Endemic typhus*Brill Zinsser disease * (weekly positive). It is negative in -Rickettsial pox*Q. Fever*Trench fever. Principle of Weil Felix test: Some Rickettsia share antigenic characteristics with certain strains of Proteus Vulgaris (0. X19 and 0. X2) and proteus mirabilis (OXK). It is purely coincidental that they have the same antigens. Proteus is not involved at all in rickettsial diseases. The Weil Felix reaction is a classic test that uses these cross reacting proteus antigens to help confirm diagnosis of a rickettsial infection. This test is done by mixing the serum of a patient suspected of having a rickettsial disease, with antigens from specific strains of proteus. If the serum has antirickettsial antibodies, latex beads coated with proteus antigens will agglutinate.",

With the increase in insecticide resistance, the older methods of mosquito control have now become promising. Some modern larvicides such as temephos which confer long effect with low toxicity are more widely used. However larviciding must be repeated at frequent intervals and for this reason it is a comparatively costly operation. (ii) Source reduction: Techniques to reduce mosquito breeding sites (often called source reduction) which include drainage or filling, deepening or flushing, management of water level, changing the salt content of water and intermittent irrigation are among the classical methods of malaria control to which attention is being paid again. Whenever practicable, measures for the improvement of the environment by the permanent reduction of sources should be instituted. {iii) Integrated control: In order to reduce too much dependance on residual insecticides, increasing emphasis is being put on \"integrated\" vector control methodology which includes bioenvironmental and personal protection measure. This approach is impoant because there is no single and simple method that would ensure control of transmission. By mid 1995 all malaria endemic countries in the region had adopted the revised malaria control strategy to reduce morbidity and moality and to reduce its area of distribution, paicularly of multidrug resistant malaria. The use of stratification approach by the majority of anti-malaria programmes in the Region has led to more cost-effective interventions. Vector resistance to insecticides has necessitated the use of more expensive pyrethroid, thereby limiting the coverage.

For this reason, neonatal tetanus is called \"the silent killer\".# Signs of neonatal tetanus usually appear 3 to 10 days after birth. At first the infant is able to feed normally. Then the infant cannot suckle and becomes irritable. Convulsions occur with increasing intensity and frequency. In the developing world, the disease progresses to difficult breathing, exhaustion, starvation, and, in most cases, death. Eliminating Neonatal Tetanus# The World Health Assembly has resolved to eliminate neonatal tetanus by the year 2000.# The WHO global target for neonatal tetanus elimination is to reduce the incidence of neonatal tetanus to less than 1 case of neonatal tetanus (NT) per 1000 live births in every district of every country in the world.# Reaching this target will reduce the global incidence of neonatal tetanus to less than 150 000 cases per year.# Fortunately, more than 60% of developing countries have already met the neonatal tetanus elimination target.

Clinically characterised by insidious onset with mild fever and an irritating cough, gradually becoming paroxysmal with the characteristic whoop often with cyanosis and vomiting. Also known as \"Hundred day cough\". AGENT FACTORS:- 1. Agent-B. peussis. Small percentage of case are caused by B. parapeussis, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus. 2. Source of infection- B. peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&; t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&; t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B. parapeussis. Mode of transmission:- Mainly by droplet infection and direct contact. Each time the patient coughs, sneezes or talks, the bacilli are sprayed into the air. The role of fomites in the spread of disease appears to be very small, unless they are freshly contaminated.

One ID dose is 0. 1 mL of vaccine and one IM dose is an entire vial of vaccine, irrespective of the vial size. Should a vaccine dose be delayed for any reason, the PEP schedule should be resumed (not restarted). Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG)RIG provides a passive immunization and is administered only once, as soon as possible after the initiation of PEP and not beyond 7 days after the first dose of vaccine.

Before use, the lyophilised vaccine is reconstituted with sterile diluent. Diluent must be cooled before reconstitution but it should not be freezed. After reconstitution, vaccine must be stored in dark at 2-8 degree celcius and used within 4 hrs. Each dose if 0. 5 ml contains > 1000 viral infective units of vaccine strain. Measles vaccine may also contain sorbitol and hydrolysed gelatin as stabilizers and neomycin but it doesn&; t have thiomersal. It is thermolabile. Age-before 9 months. The age can be lowered to 6 months if there is measles outbreak in community. For infants immunised between 6 and 9 months, second dose administered as soon as possible after the child reaches 9 months provided that at least 4 weeks have elapsed since the last dose. Route-subcutaneous/intramuscular. Immune response- both humoral and cellular. Contraindications- High fever, pregnancy, history of anaphylactic reaction to vaccine components, immunocompromised individuals, leukemia, lymphoma, severe HIV( early stage of HIV is not a contraindication), treatment with steroids, antimetabolites and serious malignancy. Adverse reactions:- TSS-toxic shock syndrome. Occurs when measles vaccine is contaminated or when the same l is used more than once on same day / next day. The vaccine should not be used after 4 hrs of reconstitution. Symptoms of TSS: severe watery diarrhoea, vomiting, high fever repoed within few hours after vaccination. TSS is totally preventable and reflects poor quality of immunisation. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 149}</p>",

Although not lethal, this parasitic disease can disable its victim temporarily. Progress towards the elimination of dracunculiasis in the past decade has been spectacular, with the number of cases falling world-wide from an estimated 892, 005 in 1989 (when most endemic countries began to repo monthly cases from each endemic village) to a total of 148 cases in 2013. In India, the last repoed case was in July 1996. On completion of three years of zero incidence, India was declared free of guineaworm disease Mode of transmission The disease is transmitted entirely through the consumption of water containing cyclops harbouring the infective stages of the parasite. Guineaworm disease is a totally water-based disease and does not have an alternate pathway of transmission. Treatment No drug cures the infection but metronidazole and mebendazole are sometimes used to limit inflammation and facilitate worm removal. Wet compresses may relieve discomfo. Occlusive dressings improves hygiene and limit shedding of infectious larvae. Worms are removed by sequentially rolling them out over a small stick. When available simple surgical procedure can be used to remove worm. Topical antibiotics may limit bacterial superinfection. Ref: Park 23rd edition Pgno: 245",

Because of financial limitations and other competitive priorities, this measure cannot be applied immediately on a large scale in developing countries, such as India. As an emergency measure, in urban areas, properly treated drinking water containing free residual chlorine should be made available to all families; this water should be stored in the household in narrow-mouthed, covered containers.

Source of infection- B. peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&; t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&; t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B. parapeussis. Mode of transmission:- Mainly by droplet infection and direct contact. Each time the patient coughs, sneezes or talks, the bacilli are sprayed into the air. The role of fomites in the spread of disease appears to be very small, unless they are freshly contaminated.

Multidrug Resistant TB - is defined by WHO as tuberculosis disease where the bacilli is resistant to Isonaiazid (H) and Rifampicin (R). with or without resistance to other drugs- Most common cause - Irregular consumption & frequent interruption in antitubercular treatment- In India 2-3% in new cases and 14%-17% in re-treatment cases - Estimated 99, 000 cases every year- Prevention of MDR-TB is given priority under RNTCP rather than its treatment. Management of MDR-TB is preferably undertaken at DOTS Plus site with experience, expertise and availability of required diagnostic and treatment facilities. Criteria for Identification of MDR-TB suspects:- A new smear positive patient remaining smear positive at the end of fifth month- A new smear negative patient becoming smear positive at the end of fifth month- A patient treated with regimen for previously treated remaining positive at fourth month- Smear positive contacts of an established / confirmed MDR-TB case. Diagnosis - Culture & drug susceptibility testing from a quality- assured laboratory. MDR - TB treatment regimen* Intensive Phase - 6-9 months, Comprises of 6 drugs (Kanamycin ), Levofloxacin (Ivx) Ethionamide, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol and Cycloserine.* Continuation Phase - 18 months. Comprises of 4 drugs (Ivx, Eto, E and Cs) p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) is a substitute drug if any of the bactericidal drug (Kanamycin / Ethonamide) is not tolerated.* Dosages of the drugs are based upon three weight bands * II patients receive drugs under direct observation on 6 days of the week. On the 7th day (Sunday), the oral drugs will be administered unsupervised and kanamycin will be omitted* If intolerance occurs to the drugs, ethionamide, cycloserine and PAS may be split into two dosages and the morning dose administered under DOT. The evening dose self - administered* The empty blister packs of the self -administered doses will be checked the next morning during DOT* 100 mg of pyridoxine is administered to all patients on the RNTCP MDR-TB treatment regimen.* If a patient gains at least 5 kg weight during treatment & crosses the weight- bands range, DOTS - plus site committee may consider moving the patient to higher weight-band drug dosages, whenever the patient is due for next 3-monthly supply of drugs in normal course of treatment. Follow-up schedule - Smear examination should be done monthly during IP and at least quarterly during CP. Culture examination should be done at least at 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of treatment. Extensively Drug Resistant TB (XDR-TB)Q - is a subset of MDR- TB* TB bacilli, in addition to being resistant to R and H, are also resistant to fluoroquinolones and any one of the 2nd line injectable drugs (namely Kanamycin, Capreomycin, or Amikacin).* XDR-TB has been reported in India",

Human to human transmission is rare; this is the most important reason. 'Fortunately, the transmission of the current H5. N1 virus is inefficient (Human to human transmission is rare). Most patients with H5. N1 infection present with pneumonia. However, if antigenic recombination occurs between H5. N1 influenza and a strain of influenza, which is highly infectious for humans, sustained human-to-human transmission could give rise to a pandemic, similar to the Spanish pandemic of 1918. This concern has spurred efforts to develop a vaccine. '- Robbins 8/e p715. Avian Influenza. Avian influenza refers to strains of influenza, which primarily infect birdsQ. One such strain with the antigenic type H5. N1 is of greater concern because infection is frequently lethal in humans (approximately 60%) and since 2003 the virus is spreading throughout the world in wild and domestic birds. Also known as 'Bird flu' or 'Highly pathogenic avian influenza'Causative agentQ: H5. N1 (Type A Influenza virus). Avian Influenza is a Pandemic: Origin from Hong Kong (1997). Nearly all cases of H5. N1 influenza in humans have been acquired by close contact with domestic birdsQ. The severity of the disease results from the ability of the virus to cause widespread infection in the human body, instead of infection being limited to the lungQ. Pathophysiology: The tissue tropism of H5. N1 influenza is increased due to the unusual structure of its hemagglutinin protein. Cleavage of viral hemagglutinin by host proteases is required for the influenza virus to enter host cells. The hemagglutinin protein of H5. N1 influenza virus, and other highly pathogenic influenza viruses, is unusual in that it can be cleaved by ubiquitous proteases in the human, white the hemagglutinin of less virulent influenza virus stains can be cleaved by proteases found in limited organs, including the lung. Fortunately, the transmission of the current H5. N1 virus is inefficientQ. However, if antigenic recombination occurs between H5. N1 influenza and a strain of influenza, which is highly infectious for humans, sustained human-to-human transmission could give rise to a pandemic, similar to the Spanish pandemic of 1918.

WHO recommends the &; Danish 1331&; strain for vaccine production. Stable for several weeks at ambient temperature in a tropical climate and for upto 1 year if kept away from direct light and stored in a cool environment below 10 deg celcius. Vaccine must be protected from light ( wrapped up in a double layer of red/ black cloth). Normal saline is recommended as diluent for reconstituting the vaccine as distilled water may cause irritation. Reconstituted vaccine may be used within 3 hours. Dosage-0. 1 mg in 0. 1 ml volume. The dose of newborn below 4 weeks is 0. 05 ml. Afministered intradermally using tuberculin syringe. Injected slightly above the inseion of left deltoid. If injected too high / too low adjacent lymph nodes may become involved and tender. The vaccine must not be contaminated with an antiseptic/detergent. If alcohol is used to swab the skin, it must be allowed to evaporate before the vaccine is given. Phenomenon after vaccination:/ 2-3 weeks after a correct intradermal injection of a potent vaccine, a papule develops at the site of vaccination. It increases slowly in size and reaches a a diameter of about 4-8 mm in 5 weeks. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow ulcer but usually seen covered by a crust. Healing occurs within 6-12weeks leaving a permanent, tiny, round scar (4-8 mm in diameter). This is a normal reaction. Normally the individual become mantoux postive after 8 weeks has elapsed. Adverse reactions: prolonged severe ulceration at the site of vaccination, suppurative lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis and disseminated BCG infection. Contraindications: BCG should not be given to patients with generalised eczema, infective dermatosis, hypogammaglobulinemia, those with history of deficient immunity, patients under immunosuppressive treatment and in pregnancy. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 196}</p>",

Clinically characterised by insidious onset with mild fever and an irritating cough, gradually becoming paroxysmal with the characteristic whoop often with cyanosis and vomiting. Also known as \"Hundred day cough\". AGENT FACTORS:- 1. Agent-B. peussis. Small percentage of case are caused by B. parapeussis, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus. 2. Source of infection- B. peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&; t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&; t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B. parapeussis. Mode of transmission:- Mainly by droplet infection and direct contact. Each time the patient coughs, sneezes or talks, the bacilli are sprayed into the air. The role of fomites in the spread of disease appears to be very small, unless they are freshly contaminated. Incubation period-7-14 days, but not more than 3 weeks. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 167}</p>",

WHO recommends the &; Danish 1331&; strain for vaccine production. Stable for several weeks at ambient temperature in a tropical climate and for upto 1 year if kept away from direct light and stored in a cool environment below 10 deg celcius. Vaccine must be protected from light ( wrapped up in a double layer of red/ black cloth). Normal saline is recommended as diluent for reconstituting the vaccine as distilled water may cause irritation. Reconstituted vaccine may be used within 3 hours. Dosage-0. 1 mg in 0. 1 ml volume. The dose of newborn below 4 weeks is 0. 05 ml. Administered intradermally using tuberculin syringe. Injected slightly above the inseion of left deltoid. If injected too high / too low adjacent lymph nodes may become involved and tender. The vaccine must not be contaminated with an antiseptic/detergent. If alcohol is used to swab the skin, it must be allowed to evaporate before the vaccine is given. Phenomenon after vaccination:/ 2-3 weeks after a correct intradermal injection of a potent vaccine, a papule develops at the site of vaccination. It increases slowly in size and reaches a a diameter of about 4-8 mm in 5 weeks. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow ulcer but usually seen covered by a crust. Healing occurs within 6-12weeks leaving a permanent, tiny, round scar (4-8 mm in diameter). This is a normal reaction. Normally the individual become mantoux postive after 8 weeks has elapsed. Adverse reactions: prolonged severe ulceration at the site of vaccination, suppurative lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis and disseminated BCG infection. Contraindications: BCG should not be given to patients with generalised eczema, infective dermatosis, hypogammaglobulinemia, those with history of deficient immunity, patients under immunosuppressive treatment and in pregnancy. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 196}</p>",

Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution.

Most important vectors are mosquitos and ticks. These viruses are maintained in nature principally, or to an important extent through biological transmission between susceptible vertebrate hosts by hematophagous arthropods; they multiply in the tissues of arthropods, and are passed on to new vertebrates by the bites of arthropod after a period of incubation. Although arboviruses are many, only a small number of them are known to be capable of producing disease. A high proportion of the infection is inapparent. Three clinical syndromes have been described: Febrile illness- Chikungunya, Dengue. Haemorrhagic fever- Dengue, Chikungunya, KFDEncephalitis- Japanese encephalitis. Chikungunya virus is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquito (commonly Aedes aegypti). Yellow fever does not exist in India. Yellow fever is largely confined to Central and South America and Africa. Dengue has four serotypes. Four types of dengue virus exist-DENI, DEN2, DEN3, DEN4. KFD was first identified in Karnataka.

        "exp": "<p>ORS Aim of oral rehydration therapy is to prevent dehydration and reduce moality. Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 m.

(a) Anti-adult measures (i) Residual spraying: The discovery of DDT in 1940s and followed by other insecticides revolutionized malaria control. The spraying of the indoor surfaces of houses with residual insecticides (e. g., DDT, malathion, fenitrothion) is still the most effective measure to kill the adult mosquito. It has been observed that discontinuation of spraying has very often led to the resurgence of malaria. This implies that spraying once applied may need to be continued for an indefinite period. If indoor spraying is to have any effect, then exhaustive coverage is needed. Indoor house spraying Reduces the longevity of the vector. Malathion and fenitrothion are organophosphate insecticides which are being used with increasing frequency For malaria control following the development of vector resistance to DDT (ii) Space application: This is a major anti-epidemic measure in mosquito-borne diseases. It involves the application of pesticides in the form of fog or mist using special equipment. The ultra-low-volume method of pesticide dispersion by air or by ground equipment has proved to be effective and economical. Outdoor space sprays reduce vector population quickly. {iii) Individual protection: Man-vector contact can be reduced by other preventive measures such as the use of repellents, protective clothing, bed-nets* (preferably impregnated with safe, long-acting repellent insecticides), mosquito coils, screening of houses etc. The methods of personal protection are of great value when properly employed.

Administration:- WHO programme on immunisation (EPI) and the national immunisation program in India recommend a primary course of 3 doses of vaccine with 1 month interval commencing at 6 weeks. It is recommended that a dose of OPV is required to be given to all children delivered in the hospital before discharge. Very impoant to complete vaccination before 6 months before most cases occur between 6 months- 3 years. Dose -2 drops Immunity:- prevents paralysis and intestinal reinfection. Thus limits virus transmission in community. The vaccine progeny excreted in faeces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts and susceptible contacts in community. Non immunised persons may therefore become immunised. This propey of OPV has been exploited in controlling epidemic. Advantages:- Antibodies quickly produced and therefore helps to control epidemic. Induces both humoral and intestinal immunity. Easy to administer. Complication:- Vaccine associated paralytic polio in recipients of vaccine and their contacts. Contraindications:- Immunocompromised. Malignancy. Leukemia. Storage-Requires to be stored and transpoed at sub zero temperature, unless stabilized. Problems with OPV:- 1. Instability of vaccine at high temperatures. 2. Frequent vaccine failures. 3. Small residual neurovirulence.

Incubation period-10 days from exposure to onset of fever and 14 days of appearance of rash. 3 stages:- 1. Prodromal stage. Begins 10 days after infection. Lasts till 14 days. Characterised by fever, coryza with sneezing and nasal discharge, cough, redness of eyes, lacrimation and photophobia. A day or two before the appearance of rash, kopliks spots like table salt like crystal appear on buccal mucosa opposite the first and second lower molars. They are small, bluish white spots on a red base. 2. Eruptive phase Typical dusky red maculopapular rash which begins behind the ear and spreads rapidly in a few hours over the face and neck and extends down the body. Fever and lesion disappear in another 3/4 days signalling the end of disease. During the prodromal phase and first 2-5days of rash, virus present in tears, nasal & throat secretions, urine and blood. The rash appears as a result of interaction of immune T cells with virus infected cells Just as the rash appears- circulating antibodies appear- and fever falls. Diagnosis of measles is based on the typical rash and kopliks spots seen in oral mucosa. In developed countries, IgM antibodies are used for diagnosis. 3. Post measles stage Child lose weight, remain weak for a number of days. There may be a failure to recover and gradual deterioration into chronic illness. There may be growth retardation, diarrhoea, pyogenic infection, candidiasis etc. Age of vaccine administration-before 9 months.

Vaccines for polio: 2 types of vaccine: IPV (Inactivated Polio Vaccine) Also k/a Salk. OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine) also called as Sabin. IPVPrimary immunization consists of 4 inoculations*. The first 3 doses are given at intervals of 1-2 months and 4th dose 6-12 months after the 3rd dose. First dose is usually given when the infant is 6 weeks old. Additional doses are recommended prior to school entry and then every 5 yrs until the age of 18. IPV does not induce intestinal and local immunity*IPV does not provide Herd immunity*It is not useful during an epidemic* becauseimmunity is not rapidly achieved as more than one dose is required to induce immunityinjections are to be avoided during epidemic times as they are likely to precipitate paralysis. IPV because does not contain live viruses is safe to administer to: immune deficient personspregnant ladiesto those over 50 yrs of age who are receiving vaccine for the first time. OPVIt is a trivalent vaccine. The vaccine contains:-Over 3 lakhs TC1. D50 of type 1 poliovirus *Over 1 lakh TCID 50 of type 2 poliovirus*Over 3 lakh TCID50 of type 3 poliovirus per dose*National immunization schedule recommends a primary course of 3 doses of OPV at 1 month intervals, commencing the first dose when infant is 6 weeks old. One booster is recommended 12-18 months later. Dose is 2 drops*OPV induces both local and systemic immunity*Even non immunized persons may be immunized with OPV because the vaccine progeny is excreted in faeces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts and contacts in community. Thus wide spread herd immunity* results, even if approximately 66% of the community is immunized. OPV is useful in controlling epidemics*. Contraindications* for administration of OPV are -acute infections*, fevers*, dysentery*, immunocompromised persons*, pregnant ladies*.",

At least there are four serotypes of dengue virus (1, 2, 3 and 4)DHF is thought to be due to double infection with dengue viruses - the first infection probably sensitises the patient. While the second appears to produce an immunological catastrophe. Dengue fever is transmitted by Aedes mosquito. Transmission cycle is \"man- mosquito-man\" type. Bleeding manifestations are not seen in classical dengue fever. It is usually seen in Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and Dengue shock syndrome(DSS). There is haemoconcentration instead of hemodilution in DHF and DSS due to plasma leakage and thrombocytopenia which results in abnormal hemostasis. Usual rash seen in dengue fever is a maculopapular or scarlentiform rash seen on 3rd or 4th day of disease. lt is accompanied by itching and hyperaesthesia. lt last for 2 hrs to several days and may be followed by desquamation.

Source of infection- B. peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&; t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age.

It is stressed that all fever cases should be suspected of malaria after ruling out other common causes and should be investigated for confirmation of malaria by Microscopy or Rapid Diagnostic Kit (RdK) so as to ensure treatment with full therapeutic dose with appropriate drug to all confirmed cases. The malaria case management is very important for preventive serious cases and death due to malaria. So, the private healthcare providers should also follow the common National Guidelines for treatment of malaria as per the Drug Policy 2013. P. vivax cases should be treated with chloroquine for 3 days & Primaquine for 14 daysQ. Primaquine is used to prevent relapse but is contraindicated in pregnant women, infants and individuals with G6. PD deficiencyQ. Note: Patients should be instructed to report back in case of hematuria or high colored urine/ cyanosis or blue coloration of lips and Primaquine should be stopped in such cases. Care should he taken in patients with anemiaQ. P. falciparum cases should be treated with ACT (Artesunate 3 days + Sulfadoxine Pyrimethamine 1 day). This is to be accompanied by single dose primaquine preferably on day 2Q. However, considering the reports of resistance to partner drug SP in North-eastern States, the Technical Advisory Committee has recommended to use the Co-formulated tablet of Artemether (20 mg)--Lumefantrine (120 mg ACT- AL) as per the age-specific dose schedule for the treatment of Pf cases in North Eastern States (not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy and for children weighing < 5 kg). Production and sale of Artemisinin monotherapy has been banned in IndiaQ. Pregnant women with uncomplicated P. falciparum should be treated as follows: 1st Trimester: Quinine2nd & 3rd Trimester: ACTNote: Primaquine is contraindicated in pregnant womanQ. In cases where parasitological diagnosis is not possible due to non-availability of either timely microscopy or RdT, suspected malaria cases will be treated with full course of chloroquine, till the results of microscopy are received. Once the parasitological diagnosis is available, appropriate treatment as per the species, is to be administered. Presumptive treatment with chloroquine is no more recommendedQ. Resistance should be suspected if in spite of full treatment with no history of vomiting, diarrhea, patient does not respond within 72 hours, clinically and parasitologically. Such cases not responding to ACT, should be treated with oral quinine with Tetracycline/Doxycvcline. These instances should be reported to concerned District Malaria/State Malaria Gfficer/ROHFW for initiation of therapeutic efficacy studies. Treatment of Severe Malaria Severe malaria is an emergency and treatment should be given as per severity & associated complications, which can be best decided by the treating physicians. Before admitting or referring patients, the attending doctor or health worker, whoever is able to do it, should do RdT and take blood smear; give a parenteral dose of artemisinin derivative or quinine in suspected cerebral malaria cases and send case sheet, details of treatment history and blood slide with patient. Parenteral artemisinin derivatives or quinine should be used irrespective of chloroquine resistance status of the area with one of the following options: Chemotherapy of severe and complicated malaria. Initial parenteral treatment for at least 48 hours with one of following four options: Quinine: 20 mg quinine salt/kg body weight on admission (IV infusion or divided IM injection) followed by maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg 8 hourly; infusion rate should not exceed 5 mg/ kg per hour. Loading dose of 20 mg/kg should not be given, if the patient has already received quinine. Artesunate: 2. 4 mg/kg IV or IM given on admission (time = 0), then at 12 h and 24 h, then once a day or Artemether: 3. 2 mg/kg IM given on admission then 1. 6 mg/kg per day or Arteether: 150 mg daily IM for 3 days in adults only (not recommended for children). Follow-up treatment, when patient can take oral medication following parenteral treatment. Quinine 10 mg/kg three times a day with doxvcycline 100 mg once a day or clindamycin in pregnant women and children under 8 years of age to complete the 7 days of treatment. After parenteral artemisinin therapy, patients will receive a full course of area-specific oral ACT for 3 days. Those patients who received parenteral quinine therapy should receive oral quinine 10 mg/kg body weight three times a day for 7 days (including the days when parenteral quinine was administered) plus doxvcycline 3 mg/kg body weight once a day or clindamycin 10 mg/kg body weight 12-hourly for 7 days (Doxvcycline is contraindicated in pregnant women and children under 8 years of age) or area-specific ACT as described. Note: Pregnant women with severe malaria in any trimester can be treated with artemisinin derivatives, which, in contrast to quinine, do not risk aggravating hypoglycemia. The parenteral treatment should be given for minimum of 48 hours. Once the patient can take oral therapy, give: Quinine 10 mg, 'kg three times a day with doxycyciine 100 mg once a day or clindamycin in pregnant women and children under 8 years of age, to complete 7 days of treatment, in patients started on parenteral quinine. Full course of ACT to patients started on artemisinin derivatives. Use of mefloquine should be avoided in cerebral malaria due to neuropsychiatric complications associated with it.",

Should be refrigerated to ensure no loss of potency. Freezing avoided. Either administered alone or in combination with other vaccine antigens including diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell or acellular peussis, Hepatitis B, or Haemophilus influenza type b. Primary/initial course consists of 4 inoculation: first 3doses given at an interval of 1-2 months and 4 th dose 6-12 months after 3 rd dose. First dose given when the infant is 6 weeks old. Additional doses recommended prior to school entry and then every 5 yrs until the age of 18. Alternatively one/two doses of OPV can be safely given as boosters after an initial course of immunisation with inactivated vaccine. Immunity:- induces circulating humoral antibodies(IgM, IgG, IgA). Doesn&; t induce intestinal or local immunity. The circulating antibodies protect the individual against paralytic polio, but do not prevent reinfection of gut by wild viruses. In case of epidemic, IPV is unsustainable because immunity is not rapidly achieved as more than one dose required to induce immunity and injections are to be avoided during epidemic as they are likely to precipitate paralysis. Advantages:- it doesn&; t contain living virus, so safe to administer: 1. To persons with immunodeficiency diseases. 2. To persons undergoing coicosteroid and radiation therapy. 3.

Maximum damage to the fetus occurs when infection is acquired in the first trimester of pregnancy. Rubellao Rubella virus belongs to togavirus family - enveloped RNA virus. o Only one antigenic type of virus exists, o Source of infection - clinical or sub-clinical case. o A large number of rubella infections are sub-clinical, this represents one of the major differences between measles and rubella. o There is no known carrier state in postnatally acquired rubella, but infants bom with congenital rubella may shed virus for many months. o Infective period - A week before the onset of symptoms to about a week after rash appears, o Rubella is much less communicable than measles because of absence of coughing in rubella, o Age group -3-10 vears. o Transmission -Droplet infection by respiratory route. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus. o Incubation period - 2-3 weeks. o Clinical manifestations. Prodromal. Low grade fever, sore throat, coryza. Lymphadenopathy. Posterior auricular, cervical and sub-occipital. Rash. Begins on the face and spreads down the body. A petechial exanthem on the soft palate - Forschheimer spots. Complicationso Arthralgiao Encephalitiso Thrombocytopenic purpura. Congenital rubella syndromeo Maternal viremia associated with rubella infection during pregnancy may result in infection of the placenta and fetus. o The most important factor in the pathogenicity of rubella virus for the fetus is gestational age at the time of infection. The earlier in pregnancy infection occurs, the greater the damage to the fetus. Risk of damage to foetus by maternal rubella during pregnancy.

The classical triad of congenital rubella consists of cataract, deafness and congenital heart diseases, o Laboratory diagnosis. Isolation of virus in cell cultures of throat samples, urine or other secretions. Normally, maternal rubella antibodies in the form of IgG is transferred to infants and is gradually last over a period of 6 months.

Incubation period-10 days from exposure to onset of fever and 14 days of appearance of rash. 3 stages:- 1. Prodromal stage. Begins 10 days after infection. Lasts till 14 days. Characterised by fever, coryza with sneezing and nasal discharge, cough, redness of eyes, lacrimation and photophobia. A day or two before the appearance of rash, kopliks spots like table salt like crystal appear on buccal mucosa opposite the first and second lower molars. They are small, bluish white spots on a red base. 2. Eruptive phase Typical dusky red maculopapular rash which begins behind the ear and spreads rapidly in a few hours over the face and neck and extends down the body. Fever and lesion disappear in another 3/4 days signalling the end of disease. During the prodromal phase and first 2-5days of rash, virus present in tears, nasal & throat secretions, urine and blood. The rash appears as a result of interaction of immune T cells with virus infected cells Just as the rash appears- circulating antibodies appear- and fever falls. Diagnosis of measles is based on the typical rash and kopliks spots seen in oral mucosa. In developed countries, IgM antibodies are used for diagnosis. 3. Post measles stage Child lose weight, remain weak for a number of days. There may be a failure to recover and gradual deterioration into chronic illness.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e. AFP surveillance is done in all children < 5 years of age AFP surveillance is carried out in all children below 15 years of age AFP Surveillance. Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is carried out to identify all remaining infected areas, monitor progress towards eradication and target supplementary immunization appropriately. The term AFP means paralysis of acute onset involving limbs leading to flaccidity. Poliomylelitis is most important etiology of AFP, other are - GBS (Guillain-Barre syndrome), transverse myelitis and traumatic neuritis. AFP surveillance aims at detecting cases of AFP and reporting them immediately to district immunization officer. Surveillance is carried out for all cases of AFP and not just for poliomyelitis. All cases of AFP are reported, regardless of the final diagnosis. As paralytic poliomyelitis is one cause of AFP, maintaining a high sensitivity of AFP reporting will ensure that all cases of paralytic poliomyelitis are detected, reported and investigated, resulting in preventive central measures to interrupt the transmission of disease. The aim of AFP surveillance is to detect polio virus transmission, and the earlier the stool is collected, the greater the chance of detecting polio virus. WHO recommends the immediate reporting and investigation of every case of AFP in children less than 15 yrs (As AFP in a person > 15 yrs is unlikely to be polio. Still, AFP surveillance must be flexible enough to report any case of AFP in an adult, if suspected to be due to poliomyelitis). Cases of AFP are classified as Polio if: Wild polio virus is isolated from any stool specimen. Cases of AFP without isolation of wild polio virus may be classified as 'polio compatible' if: Stool specimens were inadequate and. Residual weakness was present 60 days after onset of paralysis or 60-day follow-up was not done (due to death or absence) and'Expert review' concludes that these cases could not be discarded as 'non-polio' based on available data. WHO recommends obtaining 2 stool samples from AFP cases within 14 days of paralysis onset and sent to WHO accredited laboratory using Reverse cold chain. AFP surveillance is evaluated by 2 key indicators: the sensitivity of reporting (target being non-polio AFP rate of at least 1 case per 100, 000 children aged less than 15 years, this is the 'background' rate of AFP among children. Non-polio causes of AFP such as GBS, transverse myelitis, & traumatic neuritis account for this background rate.)the completeness of specimen collection (target being 2 adequate stool specimens from at least 80 per cent of all AFP cases). Mop-up Activity. Mop-up activity is a house-to-house activity where two rounds of polio immunization, 4-6 weeks apart are conducted to limit the transmission of wild poliovirus. Under the mop-up activity, children below 5 years of age are covered in affected and neighbouring districts around every detected positive polio case. The basic strategy for eradicating polio consists of: High infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral polio vaccine in the first year of life; National Immunization Days during which every child below 5 years gets 2 additional doses of OPV on 2 days separated by 4 to 6 weeks. Surveillance of AFP to identify all reservoirs of wild polio virus transmission through reporting and laboratory testing of all cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children under fifteen years of age;.

WHO recommends the &; Danish 1331&; strain for vaccine production. Stable for several weeks at ambient temperature in a tropical climate and for upto 1 year if kept away from direct light and stored in a cool environment below 10 deg celcius. Vaccine must be protected from light ( wrapped up in a double layer of red/ black cloth). Normal saline is recommended as diluent for reconstituting the vaccine as distilled water may cause irritation. Reconstituted vaccine may be used within 3 hours. Dosage-0. 1 mg in 0. 1 ml volume. The dose of newborn below 4 weeks is 0. 05 ml. Administered intradermally using tuberculin syringe. Injected slightly above the inseion of left deltoid. If injected too high / too low adjacent lymph nodes may become involved and tender. The vaccine must not be contaminated with an antiseptic/detergent. If alcohol is used to swab the skin, it must be allowed to evaporate before the vaccine is given. Phenomenon after vaccination:/ 2-3 weeks after a correct intradermal injection of a potent vaccine, a papule develops at the site of vaccination. It increases slowly in size and reaches a a diameter of about 4-8 mm in 5 weeks. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow ulcer but usually seen covered by a crust. Healing occurs within 6-12weeks leaving a permanent, tiny, round scar (4-8 mm in diameter). This is a normal reaction. Normally the individual become mantoux postive after 8 weeks has elapsed. Adverse reactions: prolonged severe ulceration at the site of vaccination, suppurative lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis and disseminated BCG infection. Contraindications: BCG should not be given to patients with generalised eczema, infective dermatosis, hypogammaglobulinemia, those with history of deficient immunity, patients under immunosuppressive treatment and in pregnancy. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 196}</p>",

        "question": "Which of the following statements about lepromin test is not true -",
        "exp": "LEPROMIN TEST The test is performed by injecting intradermally 0. 1 ml of lepromin into the inner aspect of the forearm of the individual. As a routine, the reaction is read at 48 hours and 21 days. Two types of positive reactions have been described: (a) EARLY REACTION: The early reaction is also known as Fernandez reaction. An inflammatory response develops within 24 to 48 hours and this tends to disappear after 3 to 4 days. It is evidenced by redness and induration at the site of inoculation. If the diameter of the red area is more than 10 mm at the end of 48 hours, the test is considered positive. The early positive reaction indicates whether or not a person has been previously sensitized by exposure to and infection by the leprosy bacilli. In this sense, the early reaction is much superior to the late reactfon. The early reaction has been described as delayed hypersensitivity reaction to \"soluble\" constituents of the leprosy bacilli. The reaction corresponds to the Mantoux reaction in tuberculosis, caused by the soluble antigens (PPD) of the tubercle bacilli. (b) LATE REACTION: This is the classical Mitsuda reaction. The reaction develops late, becomes apparent in 7-10 days following the injection and reaching its maximum in 3 or 4 weeks. The test is read at 21 days. At the end of 21 days, if there is a nodule more than 5 mm in diameter at the site of inoculation, the reaction is said to be positive. The nodule may even ulcerate and heal with scarring if the antigen is crude. It may be noted that the diameter of the red area in the early reaction, and the diameter of the nodule in the late reaction are measured. The early reaction is induced by the soluble constituents of the leprosy bacilli; and the late reaction by the bacillary component of the antigen. It indicates cell-mediated immunity. In the first 6 months of life, most children are lepromin negative; some may become positive by the end of first year. Data obtained from different pas of the world indicate that in endemic areas, lepromin reaction is already positive in 20 per cent of children under 5 years of age, and this propoion increases to around 60 per cent or more in the 10-14 years age group, and to 80 per cent or more in persons over 19 years of age. BCG vaccination is capable of conveing the lepra reaction from negative to positive in a large propoion of individuals. Value of the lepromin test Lepromin test is not a diagnostic test. The two drawbacks that stand in the way of this test being used for diagnosis are: (i) positive results in non-cases, and (ii) negative results in lepromatous and near-lepromatous cases. The test has been generally accepted as a useful tool in evaluating the immune status (CMI) of leprosy patients. It is of considerable value in confirming the results ofclassification of cases of leprosy on clinical and bacteriological grounds. In other words, the test is widely used as an aid to classify the type of disease. The test is also of great value in estimating the prognosis in cases of leprosy of all types. The test is usually strongly positive in the typical tuberculoid cases, and the positivity getting weaker as one passes through the spectrum to the lepromatous end, the typical lepromatous cases being lepromin negative indicating a failure of CMI. It is known that lepromin negative individuals are at a higher risk of developing progressive multibacillary leprosy, but those who are lepromin positive either escape the clinical disease (the majority) or develop paucibacillary disease (the minority).
