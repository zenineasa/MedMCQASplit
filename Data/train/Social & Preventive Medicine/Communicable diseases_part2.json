Resveratrol, a phytoalexin, and Curcumin the natural yellow pigment in turmeric elicit striking inhibitory effects on diverse cellular events associated with the process of carcinogenesis. Lycopene, a carotenoid present in tomatoes is a powerful quencher of singlet oxygen. Epidemiological evidence strongly suggests that lycopene consumption and tomato products contribute to prostate cancer risk reduction. Kolaviron, a natural biflavonoid antioxidant has been extensively investigated for it hepatoprotective, radical scavenging and antigenotoxic properties in vitro and in vivo. Preventative anticarcinogens act by enhancing an organism's natural defences against cancer, by deactivating carcinogens or by blocking the mechanisms by which carcinogens act (such as free radical damage to DNA). Anticarcinoma agents participate in the selective destruction of cancer cells, or inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. There is epidemiological evidence that a diet rich in antioxidant vitamins andflavonoids is anticarcinogenic. Interest in many popular nutritional supplements, including essential antioxidant nutrients such as selenium compounds and hormones such as melatonin and DHEA, is partly motivated by evidence that these have significant anticarcinogenic effects in appropriate quantities. The major psychoactive component in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol, has been shown to have anticarcinogenic activity.",

With the increase in insecticide resistance, the older methods of mosquito control have now become promising. Some modern larvicides such as temephos which confer long effect with low toxicity are more widely used. However larviciding must be repeated at frequent intervals and for this reason it is a comparatively costly operation. (ii) Source reduction: Techniques to reduce mosquito breeding sites (often called source reduction) which include drainage or filling, deepening or flushing, management of water level, changing the salt content of water and intermittent irrigation are among the classical methods of malaria control to which attention is being paid again. Whenever practicable, measures for the improvement of the environment by the permanent reduction of sources should be instituted. {iii) Integrated control: In order to reduce too much dependance on residual insecticides, increasing emphasis is being put on \"integrated\" vector control methodology which includes bioenvironmental and personal protection measure. This approach is impoant because there is no single and simple method that would ensure control of transmission. By mid 1995 all malaria endemic countries in the region had adopted the revised malaria control strategy to reduce morbidity and moality and to reduce its area of distribution, paicularly of multidrug resistant malaria. The use of stratification approach by the majority of anti-malaria programmes in the Region has led to more cost-effective interventions. Vector resistance to insecticides has necessitated the use of more expensive pyrethroid, thereby limiting the coverage. Malaria control added impetus as Roll Back Malaria initiative was launched by WHO, UNICEF, UNDP and the World Bank in 1998.",

Clinically characterised by insidious onset with mild fever and an irritating cough, gradually becoming paroxysmal with the characteristic whoop often with cyanosis and vomiting. Also known as \"Hundred day cough\". AGENT FACTORS:- 1. Agent-B. peussis. Small percentage of case are caused by B. parapeussis, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus. 2. Source of infection- B. peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&; t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&; t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B. parapeussis. Mode of transmission:- Mainly by droplet infection and direct contact. Each time the patient coughs, sneezes or talks, the bacilli are sprayed into the air. The role of fomites in the spread of disease appears to be very small, unless they are freshly contaminated.

Hence, even in such individuals it is recommended to start the PEPThis case is classified under WHO- Category-III. Individuals with WHO category II or III exposures should receive PEP without delay. One ID dose is 0. 1 mL of vaccine and one IM dose is an entire vial of vaccine, irrespective of the vial size. Should a vaccine dose be delayed for any reason, the PEP schedule should be resumed (not restarted). Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG)RIG provides a passive immunization and is administered only once, as soon as possible after the initiation of PEP and not beyond 7 days after the first dose of vaccine. Vaccines should never be withheld regardless of the availability of RIG. Max dose: h. RIG- 20. IU/kg, e. RIG- 40. IU/kg. All of the rabies immunoglobulin, or as much as anatomically possible (but avoiding possible compartment syndrome), should be administered into or around the wound site or sites. The remaining immunoglobulin, if any, should be injected intramuscularly at a site distant from the site of vaccine administration. Rabies immunoglobulin may be diluted to a volume, sufficient for all wounds to be effectively and safely infiltrated. Prioritization of RIG allocation:#Multiple bites > Deep wounds > Bites to head, neck and hands > Patients with severe immunodeficiency > The biting animal is confirmed or probable rabies > Bites, scratches, and exposure of mucous membranes caused by a bat. Immunodeficient individuals: In the event of exposure a complete PEP course, including RIG is recommended irrespective of the Pr. EP status. (Pr. EP) Pre-exposure prophylaxis:#Pr. EP considered in remote, rabies- endemic areas where access to PEP is difficult, the dog bite incidence is 5% per year or vampire bat rabies is known to be present.#2 sites ID or a 1-site IM vaccine administration on days 0 and 7.#A routine Pr. EP booster or serology for neutralizing antibody titers is recommended only if a continued, high risk of rabies exposure remains.#Individuals with documented immunodeficiency should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and best receive an ID or IM Pr.

Multidrug Resistant TB - is defined by WHO as tuberculosis disease where the bacilli is resistant to Isonaiazid (H) and Rifampicin (R). with or without resistance to other drugs- Most common cause - Irregular consumption & frequent interruption in antitubercular treatment- In India 2-3% in new cases and 14%-17% in re-treatment cases - Estimated 99, 000 cases every year- Prevention of MDR-TB is given priority under RNTCP rather than its treatment. Management of MDR-TB is preferably undertaken at DOTS Plus site with experience, expertise and availability of required diagnostic and treatment facilities. Criteria for Identification of MDR-TB suspects:- A new smear positive patient remaining smear positive at the end of fifth month- A new smear negative patient becoming smear positive at the end of fifth month- A patient treated with regimen for previously treated remaining positive at fourth month- Smear positive contacts of an established / confirmed MDR-TB case. Diagnosis - Culture & drug susceptibility testing from a quality- assured laboratory. MDR - TB treatment regimen* Intensive Phase - 6-9 months, Comprises of 6 drugs (Kanamycin ), Levofloxacin (Ivx) Ethionamide, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol and Cycloserine.* Continuation Phase - 18 months. Comprises of 4 drugs (Ivx, Eto, E and Cs) p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) is a substitute drug if any of the bactericidal drug (Kanamycin / Ethonamide) is not tolerated.* Dosages of the drugs are based upon three weight bands * II patients receive drugs under direct observation on 6 days of the week. On the 7th day (Sunday), the oral drugs will be administered unsupervised and kanamycin will be omitted* If intolerance occurs to the drugs, ethionamide, cycloserine and PAS may be split into two dosages and the morning dose administered under DOT. The evening dose self - administered* The empty blister packs of the self -administered doses will be checked the next morning during DOT* 100 mg of pyridoxine is administered to all patients on the RNTCP MDR-TB treatment regimen.* If a patient gains at least 5 kg weight during treatment & crosses the weight- bands range, DOTS - plus site committee may consider moving the patient to higher weight-band drug dosages, whenever the patient is due for next 3-monthly supply of drugs in normal course of treatment. Follow-up schedule - Smear examination should be done monthly during IP and at least quarterly during CP. Culture examination should be done at least at 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of treatment. Extensively Drug Resistant TB (XDR-TB)Q - is a subset of MDR- TB* TB bacilli, in addition to being resistant to R and H, are also resistant to fluoroquinolones and any one of the 2nd line injectable drugs (namely Kanamycin, Capreomycin, or Amikacin).* XDR-TB has been reported in India",

Most patients with H5. N1 infection present with pneumonia. However, if antigenic recombination occurs between H5. N1 influenza and a strain of influenza, which is highly infectious for humans, sustained human-to-human transmission could give rise to a pandemic, similar to the Spanish pandemic of 1918. This concern has spurred efforts to develop a vaccine. '- Robbins 8/e p715. Avian Influenza. Avian influenza refers to strains of influenza, which primarily infect birdsQ. One such strain with the antigenic type H5. N1 is of greater concern because infection is frequently lethal in humans (approximately 60%) and since 2003 the virus is spreading throughout the world in wild and domestic birds. Also known as 'Bird flu' or 'Highly pathogenic avian influenza'Causative agentQ: H5. N1 (Type A Influenza virus). Avian Influenza is a Pandemic: Origin from Hong Kong (1997). Nearly all cases of H5. N1 influenza in humans have been acquired by close contact with domestic birdsQ. The severity of the disease results from the ability of the virus to cause widespread infection in the human body, instead of infection being limited to the lungQ. Pathophysiology: The tissue tropism of H5. N1 influenza is increased due to the unusual structure of its hemagglutinin protein. Cleavage of viral hemagglutinin by host proteases is required for the influenza virus to enter host cells. The hemagglutinin protein of H5. N1 influenza virus, and other highly pathogenic influenza viruses, is unusual in that it can be cleaved by ubiquitous proteases in the human, white the hemagglutinin of less virulent influenza virus stains can be cleaved by proteases found in limited organs, including the lung. Fortunately, the transmission of the current H5. N1 virus is inefficientQ. However, if antigenic recombination occurs between H5. N1 influenza and a strain of influenza, which is highly infectious for humans, sustained human-to-human transmission could give rise to a pandemic, similar to the Spanish pandemic of 1918.

It has been the experience of workers at Kolkata that as many as 90-95 per cent of all cases of cholera and acute diarrhoea can be treated by oral fluids alone.

Also known as \"Hundred day cough\". AGENT FACTORS:- 1. Agent-B. peussis. Small percentage of case are caused by B. parapeussis, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus. 2. Source of infection- B. peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&; t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&; t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B. parapeussis. Mode of transmission:- Mainly by droplet infection and direct contact. Each time the patient coughs, sneezes or talks, the bacilli are sprayed into the air.

WHO recommends the &; Danish 1331&; strain for vaccine production. Stable for several weeks at ambient temperature in a tropical climate and for upto 1 year if kept away from direct light and stored in a cool environment below 10 deg celcius. Vaccine must be protected from light ( wrapped up in a double layer of red/ black cloth). Normal saline is recommended as diluent for reconstituting the vaccine as distilled water may cause irritation. Reconstituted vaccine may be used within 3 hours. Dosage-0. 1 mg in 0. 1 ml volume. The dose of newborn below 4 weeks is 0. 05 ml. Administered intradermally using tuberculin syringe. Injected slightly above the inseion of left deltoid. If injected too high / too low adjacent lymph nodes may become involved and tender. The vaccine must not be contaminated with an antiseptic/detergent. If alcohol is used to swab the skin, it must be allowed to evaporate before the vaccine is given. Phenomenon after vaccination:/ 2-3 weeks after a correct intradermal injection of a potent vaccine, a papule develops at the site of vaccination. It increases slowly in size and reaches a a diameter of about 4-8 mm in 5 weeks. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow ulcer but usually seen covered by a crust. Healing occurs within 6-12weeks leaving a permanent, tiny, round scar (4-8 mm in diameter). This is a normal reaction. Normally the individual become mantoux postive after 8 weeks has elapsed. Adverse reactions: prolonged severe ulceration at the site of vaccination, suppurative lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis and disseminated BCG infection. Contraindications: BCG should not be given to patients with generalised eczema, infective dermatosis, hypogammaglobulinemia, those with history of deficient immunity, patients under immunosuppressive treatment and in pregnancy. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 196}</p>",

Infection after 16 weeks causes no major abnormalities. o The classical triad of congenital rubella consists of cataract, deafness and CHD. o Presence of IgM in blood at birth is diagnostic, as is the persistance of IgG after 6 months of age.

        "exp": "<p>ORS Aim of oral rehydration therapy is to prevent dehydration and reduce moality. Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 m. Osm/l improved the efficacy of ORS regimen for children with acute non cholera diarrhoea.

        "exp": "<p>ORS Aim of oral rehydration therapy is to prevent dehydration and reduce moality. Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 m.

(a) Anti-adult measures (i) Residual spraying: The discovery of DDT in 1940s and followed by other insecticides revolutionized malaria control. The spraying of the indoor surfaces of houses with residual insecticides (e. g., DDT, malathion, fenitrothion) is still the most effective measure to kill the adult mosquito. It has been observed that discontinuation of spraying has very often led to the resurgence of malaria. This implies that spraying once applied may need to be continued for an indefinite period. If indoor spraying is to have any effect, then exhaustive coverage is needed. Indoor house spraying Reduces the longevity of the vector. Malathion and fenitrothion are organophosphate insecticides which are being used with increasing frequency For malaria control following the development of vector resistance to DDT (ii) Space application: This is a major anti-epidemic measure in mosquito-borne diseases. It involves the application of pesticides in the form of fog or mist using special equipment. The ultra-low-volume method of pesticide dispersion by air or by ground equipment has proved to be effective and economical. Outdoor space sprays reduce vector population quickly. {iii) Individual protection: Man-vector contact can be reduced by other preventive measures such as the use of repellents, protective clothing, bed-nets* (preferably impregnated with safe, long-acting repellent insecticides), mosquito coils, screening of houses etc. The methods of personal protection are of great value when properly employed.

At least there are four serotypes of dengue virus (1, 2, 3 and 4)DHF is thought to be due to double infection with dengue viruses - the first infection probably sensitises the patient. While the second appears to produce an immunological catastrophe. Dengue fever is transmitted by Aedes mosquito. Transmission cycle is \"man- mosquito-man\" type. Bleeding manifestations are not seen in classical dengue fever. It is usually seen in Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and Dengue shock syndrome(DSS). There is haemoconcentration instead of hemodilution in DHF and DSS due to plasma leakage and thrombocytopenia which results in abnormal hemostasis. Usual rash seen in dengue fever is a maculopapular or scarlentiform rash seen on 3rd or 4th day of disease. lt is accompanied by itching and hyperaesthesia. lt last for 2 hrs to several days and may be followed by desquamation.

SEVERE PNEUMONIA Most impoant sign to consider when deciding if the child has pneumonia are the RR and chest indrawing. A child with chest indrawing may not have fast breathing if the child becomes exhausted. Then the breathing slows down. Un such cases chest indrawing may be the only sign in a child with severe pneumonia. Other signs: 1. Nasal flare 2. Grunting 3. Cyanosis 4. Wheezing Treatment:- Refer urgently to hospital. Give first dose antibiotics. Treat fever and wheeze if present. PMEUMONIA:- 1. Fast breathing 2. No chest indrawing Treatment:- Advice mother to give home care. Give an antibiotic. Treat fever and wheeze if present. Advice mother to return eith child in 2 days for reassessment, or earlier if child gets worse. No pneumonia:- 1. Simple cough or cold. Treatment:- Assess and treat ear problems or sore throat. Assess and treat other problems. Advice mother to give home care.

Maximum damage to the fetus occurs when infection is acquired in the first trimester of pregnancy. Rubellao Rubella virus belongs to togavirus family - enveloped RNA virus. o Only one antigenic type of virus exists, o Source of infection - clinical or sub-clinical case. o A large number of rubella infections are sub-clinical, this represents one of the major differences between measles and rubella. o There is no known carrier state in postnatally acquired rubella, but infants bom with congenital rubella may shed virus for many months. o Infective period - A week before the onset of symptoms to about a week after rash appears, o Rubella is much less communicable than measles because of absence of coughing in rubella, o Age group -3-10 vears. o Transmission -Droplet infection by respiratory route. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus. o Incubation period - 2-3 weeks. o Clinical manifestations. Prodromal. Low grade fever, sore throat, coryza. Lymphadenopathy. Posterior auricular, cervical and sub-occipital. Rash. Begins on the face and spreads down the body. A petechial exanthem on the soft palate - Forschheimer spots. Complicationso Arthralgiao Encephalitiso Thrombocytopenic purpura. Congenital rubella syndromeo Maternal viremia associated with rubella infection during pregnancy may result in infection of the placenta and fetus. o The most important factor in the pathogenicity of rubella virus for the fetus is gestational age at the time of infection.

Secondary attack rate-infection confers life long immunity as there is only one antigenic type. Incubation period-10 days from exposure to onset of fever and 14 days of appearance of rash. 3 stages:- 1. Prodromal stage. Begins 10 days after infection. Lasts till 14 days. Characterised by fever, coryza with sneezing and nasal discharge, cough, redness of eyes, lacrimation and photophobia. A day or two before the appearance of rash, kopliks spots like table salt like crystal appear on buccal mucosa opposite the first and second lower molars. They are small, bluish white spots on a red base. 2. Eruptive phase Typical dusky red maculopapular rash which begins behind the ear and spreads rapidly in a few hours over the face and neck and extends down the body. Fever and lesion disappear in another 3/4 days signalling the end of disease. During the prodromal phase and first 2-5days of rash, virus present in tears, nasal & throat secretions, urine and blood. The rash appears as a result of interaction of immune T cells with virus infected cells Just as the rash appears- circulating antibodies appear- and fever falls. Diagnosis of measles is based on the typical rash and kopliks spots seen in oral mucosa. In developed countries, IgM antibodies are used for diagnosis. 3. Post measles stage Child lose weight, remain weak for a number of days. There may be a failure to recover and gradual deterioration into chronic illness. There may be growth retardation, diarrhoea, pyogenic infection, candidiasis etc. {Reference: park&; s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no. 149}</p>",

Diphtheriao Diphtheria is an acute infectious disease caused by toxigenic strains of corynebacterium diphtheriae. o Source of infection - cases or carriers; carriers are common sources of infection, their ratio is estimated to be 95 carriers for 5 clinical cases. o Infective period-14-28 days from the onset of disease, o Age group-1 to 5 yearso Sex-Both sexeso Incubation period-2-6 dayso The period of infectivity may vary from 14 to 28 days from the onset of the disease, but carriers may remain infective for much longer period. o A case or carrier may be considered non-communicable when at least 2 cultures properly obtained from nose and throat, 24 hours apart, are negative for diphtheria bacilli. Control of diphtheriao Control diphtheria requires. Control in cases and carrier. Control for contacts (prophylaxis for contact). Prophylaxis for community ->> by vaccination. Control in cases and carrier1) Early diagnosis-By nose & throat examination and culture. 2) Isolation-For at least 14 days or until proved free of infection, i. e. at least 2 consecutive nose and throat swabs, taken 24 hours apart, should be negative before terminating isolation. Treatmenti) Cases-Diphtheria antitoxin plus penicillin or erythromycin. ii) Carrier-Erythromycin",

Man biting rate (biting density): It is defined as the average incidence of anopheline bites per day per person. It is determined by standardized vector cache on human bait. Sporozoite rate: It is percentage of female anopheles with sporozoites in the salivary gland. Inoculation rate: The man-biting rate multiplied by the infective sporozoite rate is called as Inoculation rate. Human blood index: It is the proportion of freshly fed female anopheline mosquitoes whose stomach contains human blood. It indicates the degree of anthrophilism. Mosquito density: It is usually expressed as the number of mosquitoes per man-hour-catch. Points to Remember. Pre-eradication era malariometric indicators: Parameters are based on clinical diagnosis (Spleen rate, average enlargement spleen, parasite rate, parasite density index, Infant parasite rate and proportional case rate). Eradication era malariometric indicators: Parameter based on microscopic diagnosis of malaria.#Annual parasite incidence#Annual blood examination rate#Annual falciparum incidence#Slide positive rate#Slide falciparum rate. Vector indices are:-#Human blood index, sporozoite rate, mosquito density#Man biting rate and inoculation rate. Some Important Indicator. Spleen rate: Endemically of malaria in a community.
