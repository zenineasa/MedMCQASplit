The WHO has recommended the following procedures for the prevention and control of air pollution : (a) Containment : That is, prevention of escape of toxic substances into the ambient air. Containment can be achieved by a variety of engineering methods such as enclosure, ventilation and air deaning. A major contribution in this field is the development of \"arresters\" for the removal of contaminants. (b) Replacement : That is, replacing a technological process causing air pollution, by a new process that does not. Increased use of electricity, solar power generation, natural gas, and central heating in place of coal have greatly helped in smoke reduction. There is a move now to reduce lead in petrol which is a cumulative poison. In India also deleaded petrol is being used. (c) Dilution : Dilution is valid so long as it is within the self- cleaning capacity of the environment. For example, some air pollutants are readily removed by vegetation. The establishment of \"green belts\" between industrial and residential areas is an attempt at dilution. The capacity for dilution is, however, limited and trouble occurs when the atmosphere is overburdened with pollutants. (d) Legislation: Air pollution is controlled in many countries by suitable legislation, e.g., Clean Air Acts. Legislation covers such matters as height of chimneys, powers to local authorities to carry out investigations, research and education concerning air pollution, creation of smokeless zones and enforcement of standard for ambient air quality. To prevent or reduce the usage of double engine. To decrease the nuisance of air pollution, the Government of India have enacted \"The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act\" in 1981. (e) International action : To deal with air pollution on a world-wide scale, the WHO has established an international network of laboratories for the monitoring and study of air pollution. The network consists of two international centres at London and Washington, three centres at Moscow, Nagpur and Tokyo and 20 laboratories in various pas of the world. These centres will issue warnings of air pollution where and when necessary. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 774",

During the 19th century their use spread throughout the world. Even today, they are generally accepted as the standard method of water purification. Elements of a slow sand filter Essentially these consists of : (1) supernatant (raw) water (2) a bed of graded sand (3) an under-drainage system; and (4) a system of filter control valves. Vital layer : When the filter is newly laid, it acts merely as a mechanical strainer, and cannot truly be considered as \"biological\". But very soon, the surface of the sand bed gets covered with a slimy growth known as \"Schmutzdecke\", vital layer, zoogleal layer or biological layer. This layer is slimy and gelatinous and consists of threadlike algae and numerous forms of life including plankton, diatoms and bacteria. The formation of vital layer is known as \"ripening\" of the filter. It may take several days for the vital layer to form fully, and when fully formed it extends for 2 to 3 cm into the top poion of the sand bed. The vital layer is the \"hea\" of the slow sand filter. It removes organic matter, holds back bacteria and oxidizes ammoniacal nitrogen into nitrates and helps in yielding a bacteria-free water. Until the vital layer is fully formed, the first few days filtrate is usually run to waste. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 751",

        "exp": "Dechlorination Add a reducing agent to containers intended for the collection of water having residual chlorine or other halogen unless they contain broth for direct incubation of sample. Sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) is a satisfactory dechlorination agent that neutralizes any residual halogen and prevents continuation of bactericidal action during sample transit. The examination then will indicate more accurately the true microbial content of the water at the time of sampling. For sampling chlorinated wastewater effluents add sufficient Na2S2O3 to a clean sample bottle to give a concentration of 100 mg/L in the sample. In a 120-mL bottle 0.1 mL of a 10% solution of Na2S2O3 will neutralize a sample containing up to 15 mg/L residual chlorine. For drinking water samples, the concentration of dechlorination agent may be reduced: 0.1 mL of a 3% solution of Na2S2O3 in a 120-mL bottle will neutralize up to 5 mg/L residual chlorine. See Table 9060:I for preparation of sodium thiosulfate solutions. Where possible, determine normal residual chlorine before sampling at a new site (e.g., pool water may contain a higher chlorine level than normal) to enable laboratory to prepare an adequate amount of dechlorination agent per sample bottle. Discard turbid (bacterial growth) 10% sodium thiosulfate stock solutions. Loosely cap bottle and sterilize by either dry or moist heat, as directed (Section 9040) and perform sterility checks as noted in Section 9020B.5d.

The indicators of pollution include the amount of total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) at 20 deg. C, concentration of chlorides, nitrates and phosphorus and absence of dissolved oxygen. Even if the source of water supply and its treatment are of a high standard, water pollution may still occur as often happens, due to corrosion of pipe lines, leaky joints and cross connections between water supply pipes and sewage drainage pipes. Surveillance has to be exercised at every point in the distribution system to ensure supply of safe water to the consumer. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 760",

Khesari dhal (lathyrus sativus), is consumed in pas of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, excessive consumption of which is associated with lathyrism. Pulses contain 20 to 25 per cent of proteins, which is double that found in wheat and three times that found in rice. II') fact, pulses contain more protein than eggs, fish or flesh foods. Biological fixation of nitrogen occurs. But in regard to quality, pulse proteins are inferior to animal proteins. Pulse proteins are poor in methionine and to a lesser extent in cysteine. On the other hand they are rich in lysine. Soyabean is exceptionally rich in protein, containing up to 40 per cent. In addition, pulses are rich in minerals and B-group vitamins such as riboflavin and thiamine. In the dry state, pulses do not contain vitamin C. Germinating pulses, however, contain higher concentration of vitamins, especially vitamin C and B vitamins. Fermentation also modifies the nutritive value of pulses .in that the vitamin content paicularly that of riboflavin, thiamine and niacin is enhanced. Although pulses are called \"poor man's meat\", they are eaten by the rich and poor alike in India. They give variety to the diet and make the food more palatable.

There is a veical spindle which is attached to the 'anemometer box'. The velocity of the wind is indicated on a counter called the cyclometer, placed in the anemometer box. Wind velocities are normally recorded in open flat country at a height of 10 m. Velocities are measured in metres per second (m/s.). When the wind speed is 0.5 m/s, it is described as complete calm with smoke rising veically; when it is 3.3 m/s, it is described as slight breeze with leaves rustling; when it is 10 m/s, it is described as strong wind with larger branches of trees moving; when it is 15-20 m/s, it is called storm; when it is 25-30 m/s, it is called gale; and over 30-50 m/s, it is called hurricane.

A healthful school environment therefore is necessary for thebest emotional, social and personal health of the pupils.Schools should also serve as demonstration centres of goodsanitation to the community. The following minimumstandards for sanitation of the school and its environs have been suggested in India (1) Location : The school should normally be centrally situated with proper approach roads and at a fair distance from busy places and roads, cinema houses, factories, railway tracks and market places. The school premises should be properly fenced and kept free from all hazards. (2) Site : The site should be on suitable high land, and not subject to inundation or dampness and can be properly drained. The School Health Committee {1961) had recommended that 10 acres of land be provided for higher elementary schools and 5 acres for primary schools with an additional one acre of land per 100 students. In congested areas, the nearest public park or playground should be made available to the students. {3) Structure : Nursery and secondary schools, as far as possible, be single storied. Exterior walls should have a minimum thickness of 10 inches and should be heat resistant. (4) Classroom : Verandhas should be attached to classrooms. No classroom should accommodate more than 40 students. Per capita space for students in a classroom should not be less than 10 sq. ft. (5) Furniture : Furniture should suit the age group of students. It is desirable to provide single desks and chairs. Desks should be of \"minus\" type. Chairs should be provided with proper back-rests, with facilities for desk-work. (6) Doors and windows: The windows should be broad with the bottom sill, at a height of 2'-6\" from the floor level; combined door and window area should be at least 25 per cent of the floor space; windows should be placed on different walls for cross-ventilation; the ventilators should not be less than 2 per cent of the floor area. (7) Colour : Inside colour of the classroom should be white and should be periodically white-washed. (8) Lighting : Classrooms should have sufficient natural light, preferably from the left, and should not be from the front. (9) Water supply : There should be an independent source of safe and potable water supply, which should be continuous, and distributed from the taps. (10) Eating facilities : Vendors other than those approved by the school authorities should not be allowed inside school premises; there should be a separate room provided for mid-day meals. (11) Lavatory : Privies and urinals should be provided one urinal for 60 students and one latrine for 100 students. Arrangements should be separately made for boys and girls.

Biomethane -- refined biogas from anaerobic digestion or landfills -- can be used. CNG is made by compressing natural gas, (which is mainly composed of methane, CH4), to less than 1% of the volume it occupies at standard atmospheric pressure.

Domestic fires, power generation and motor vehicles can also produce emissions containing sulphur dioxide. S02 can affect the respiratory system and the function of lungs, and causes irritation of eyes. Inflammation of the respiratory tract causes coughing, mucus secretion, aggravation of asthma and chronic bronchitis, and makes people more prone to infections of the respiratory tract. Hospital admissions for cardiac disease and moality increase on days with higher S02 levels. When S02 combines with water, it forms sulphuric acid; this is the main component of acid rain which is a cause of deforestation. It causes deterioration of leather items. A S02 concentration of 500 ug/m3 should not be exceeded over average periods of 10 minutes duration. Studies indicate that a propoion of people with asthma experience changes in pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms after periods of exposure to S02 as sho as 10 minutes.

The CRSP \"was staed in 1986 to provide sanitation facilities in rural areas. It was a supply driven, highly subsidy and infrastructure oriented programme\". The conditions also varied substantially across the country. An all-India survey on conditions of drinking water, sanitation and hygiene during the period January to June, 1998 was carried out by the National Sample Survey Organisation, and results showed significant disparities across rural and urban populations: The propoion of households repoing that they had no bathroom was much higher in rural areas (81 percent) than in urban areas (35 percent). As many as 83 percent of households in rural areas repoed using no latrines as against only 26 percent in urban areas. Only about 8 percent and 1 percent of rural households repoed using a septic tank and sewerage system, compared to 35 percent and 22 percent of urban households. Similarly, the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare repoed in 1998-99 that: On an average, 30 million persons in rural areas suffer from sanitation-related disease Five of the ten most dangerous fatal diseases of children aged from one to four in rural areas are related to water and sanitation Ref: Centre for public impact, GOI",
