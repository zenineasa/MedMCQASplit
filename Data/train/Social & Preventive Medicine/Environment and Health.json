        "question": "Which of the following will be useful control strategies to check outdoor pollution with the \"fine\" paiculate matter?",
        "exp": "Prevention and control of air pollution The control of air pollution is ultimately an engineering problem. The WHO has recommended the following procedures for the prevention and control of air pollution: (a) Containment: That is, prevention of escape of toxic substances into the ambient air. Containment can be achieved by a variety of engineering methods such as enclosure, ventilation and air deaning. A major contribution in this field is the development of \"arresters\" for the removal of contaminants. (b) Replacement: That is, replacing a technological process causing air pollution, by a new process that does not. Increased use of electricity, solar power generation, natural gas, and central heating in place of coal have greatly helped in smoke reduction. There is a move now to reduce lead in petrol which is a cumulative poison. In India also deleaded petrol is being used. (c) Dilution: Dilution is valid so long as it is within the self- cleaning capacity of the environment. For example, some air pollutants are readily removed by vegetation. The establishment of \"green belts\" between industrial and residential areas is an attempt at dilution. The capacity for dilution is, however, limited and trouble occurs when the atmosphere is overburdened with pollutants. (d) Legislation: Air pollution is controlled in many countries by suitable legislation, e. g., Clean Air Acts. Legislation covers such matters as height of chimneys, powers to local authorities to carry out investigations, research and education concerning air pollution, creation of smokeless zones and enforcement of standard for ambient air quality. To prevent or reduce the usage of double engine. To decrease the nuisance of air pollution, the Government of India have enacted \"The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act\" in 1981. (e) International action: To deal with air pollution on a world-wide scale, the WHO has established an international network of laboratories for the monitoring and study of air pollution. The network consists of two international centres at London and Washington, three centres at Moscow, Nagpur and Tokyo and 20 laboratories in various pas of the world. These centres will issue warnings of air pollution where and when necessary. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno: 774",

During the 19th century their use spread throughout the world. Even today, they are generally accepted as the standard method of water purification. Elements of a slow sand filter Essentially these consists of: (1) supernatant (raw) water (2) a bed of graded sand (3) an under-drainage system; and (4) a system of filter control valves. Vital layer: When the filter is newly laid, it acts merely as a mechanical strainer, and cannot truly be considered as \"biological\". But very soon, the surface of the sand bed gets covered with a slimy growth known as \"Schmutzdecke\", vital layer, zoogleal layer or biological layer. This layer is slimy and gelatinous and consists of threadlike algae and numerous forms of life including plankton, diatoms and bacteria. The formation of vital layer is known as \"ripening\" of the filter. It may take several days for the vital layer to form fully, and when fully formed it extends for 2 to 3 cm into the top poion of the sand bed. The vital layer is the \"hea\" of the slow sand filter. It removes organic matter, holds back bacteria and oxidizes ammoniacal nitrogen into nitrates and helps in yielding a bacteria-free water. Until the vital layer is fully formed, the first few days filtrate is usually run to waste. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno: 751",

The schemes follows from the Insecticides Act of 1968 and the Insecticides Rules of 1971. The labeling follows a general scheme as laid down in the Insecticides Rules, 1971, and contains information such as brand name, name of manufacturer, name of the antidote in case of accidental consumption etc. A major aspect of the label is a color mark, which represents the toxicity of the material by a color code. Thus the labelling scheme proposes four different colour labels: viz red. yellow, blue, and green. The toxicity classification applies only to pesticides, which are allowed to he sold in India. Some of the classified pesticides may be banned in some states of india, by decision of the state governments. Some of the red-label and yellow-label pesticides were banned in the state of Kerala following the Endosulfan protests of 2011. Name. Level of toxicity.

There are two main tribes of mosquitoes - Tribe anopheline and Tribe culicini.# The tribe anopheline contains only one genus:- Anopheles.# The tribe Culicini is represented in India by 15 genera, of which the important ones are:- Culex, - Aedes, and - Mansonia. Mansonia# They are big, black or brown with speckling on their wings and legs.# The common Indian species are:- M. annulifera, M. uniformis, M. indiana and M. longipalpis.# Breed in ponds and lakes containing aquatic plants, especially the floating ones like Pistia strtiotes and water hyacinth.# The eggs are laid on the undersurface of leaves.# The larvae and pupae are found attached to the rootlets of these plants by their siphon tubes; they obtain their air supply from these rootlets.# When about to become adults, the pupae come to water surface and fully formed adults emerge and escape. Control:-1. Biological. The best knowns are the Gambusia affinis, Lebister reticulates and Brabel fish. These fish were used successfully in eradicating guinea worm in parts of Kar state. 2. Chemical Control: The commonly used larvicides are: a) Mineral oils, b) Paris green and c) Synthetic insecticides.

This is the early sign of dental flourosis. Mottling is best seen on the incisors of the upper jaw. It is almost entirely confined to permanent teeth and develops only during the period of formation. Skeletal flourosis: This is associated with lifetime daily intake of 3. 0 to 6. 0 mg/1. Genu valgum: A new form of flourosis characterised by genu valgum and osteoporosis of the lower limbs in recent years. Intervention: Changing of water source: Running surface water contains lower quantity of flourides than ground water. Chemical treatment: Nalgonda technique for deflouridisation of water.

These impurities are derived from the atmosphere, catchment area and the soil. * A more serious aspect of water pollution is that caused by human activity - urbanization and industrialization. The sources of pollution resulting from these are: (a) sewage, which contains decomposable organic matter and pathogenic agents (b) industrial and trade wastes, which contain toxic agents ranging from metal salts to complex synthetic organic chemicals (c) agricultural pollutants, which comprise feilizers and pesticides, and (d) physical pollutants, viz heat (thermal pollution) and radioactive Substances. The indicators of pollution include the amount of total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) at 20 deg. C, concentration of chlorides, nitrates and phosphorus and absence of dissolved oxygen. Even if the source of water supply and its treatment are of a high standard, water pollution may still occur as often happens, due to corrosion of pipe lines, leaky joints and cross connections between water supply pipes and sewage drainage pipes. Surveillance has to be exercised at every point in the distribution system to ensure supply of safe water to the consumer. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno: 760",

        "question": "True about global warming is",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. C02 is the major greenhouse gas CO2 and water vapour are the two most important and major greenhouse gases. Global warming is a vast topic to be discussed in detail here. So we will deal with it briefly in context of the given options. Global warming: Global warming is the increase in the temperature of earth's near-surface air and oceans. The global surface temperature has increased approximately 0. 6 degC (1. 3 degF) since the mid 20th century. This increase in temperature is caused by increasing concentration of greenhouse gases. Effects of global warming. Warming is expected to affect the Arctic most, and would be associated with continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost and sea ice. Rising of sea level. Expansion of subtropical deserts. Changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (like flood, storm etc.). Species extinctions. Changes in agricultural yield. Greenhouse gases. In order, Earth's most abundant greenhouse gases are -Water vapour =60-70%Carbon dioxide = 55% (option a). Atmospheric methane. Nitrous oxide. Ozone. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC). The main sources of greenhouse gases d/t human activity are. Burning of fossil fuels & deforestation - | CO2. Enteric fermentation in ruminant animals, paddy rice farming and covered vented garbage landfill emissions, drilling for oil and natural gas- | methane. Use of CFCs in refrigerator & use of CFC & halons in fire suppression systems. Use of fertilizers in agriculture | N2O. Greenhouse effect'Greenhouse effect' is the heating of the Earth d/t presence of greenhouse gases. It is named this way because of a similar effect produced by the glass panes of a green house. The shorter wavelength radiation from sun, is absorbed by the surface of the earth, causing it to worm. Part of the absorbed energy is then re-radiated back to atmosphere as long wave infrared radiation. The greenhouse gases selectively transmit the infrared waves, allowing some to pass through into space and some are absorbed. The absorbed waves are re-emitted downward, causing the lower atmosphere to warm. The greenhouse effect is essential for living beings on earth, as it makes the earth warm enough to live. (Without the greenhouse effect the earth surface would be 33 degC colder than at present!!!). But it is the 'enhanced' greenhouse effect due to increased concentration of greenhouse gases that is causing global warming. The clouds are the major non-gas contributor to the Earth's greenhouse effect. Ozone layers of atmosphere. Stratosphere. It is the highest level of ozone. It is spread b/w 10 km and 50 km above the Earth surface. It contains 90% of ozone of the atmosphere. Stratosphere is beneficial as it filters out the harmful ultraviolet rays from sun (option b). Troposphere. It is the lower most atmospheric layer extending from the surface to 10 km (18 km at poles). The troposphere contains ~ 80% mass of atmosphere. The ozone present in this layer is an atmospheric pollutant & also produces greenhouse effect. In recent decades the amount of ozone in the stratosphere has been declining mostly because of emissions of CFCs and similar chlorinated & brominated organic molecules (option c). Kyoto protocol: It is a protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Aim is to stabilising greenhouse gas concentration to fight global warming. The protocol was initially adopted on 11th Dec 1997 in Kyoto, Japan & entered into force on 16th Feb 2005. By Nov 2009, 187 states have signed the protocol. Under this protocol 37 industrialised countries commit to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 5. 2% from the 1990 level by 2008-2012(option d). Rest of the member countries have given general commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emission. Also know. Global dimming, in simple words, is a phenomenon which produces forces opposite to global warming. Global dimming causes the amount of sun's rays reaching the earth's atmosphere to reduce & causes a drop of temperatures around the globe. It is thought to have been caused by an increase in atmospheric aerosols in the atmosphere due to human action.",

Biological fixation of nitrogen occurs. But in regard to quality, pulse proteins are inferior to animal proteins. Pulse proteins are poor in methionine and to a lesser extent in cysteine. On the other hand they are rich in lysine. Soyabean is exceptionally rich in protein, containing up to 40 per cent. In addition, pulses are rich in minerals and B-group vitamins such as riboflavin and thiamine. In the dry state, pulses do not contain vitamin C. Germinating pulses, however, contain higher concentration of vitamins, especially vitamin C and B vitamins. Fermentation also modifies the nutritive value of pulses. in that the vitamin content paicularly that of riboflavin, thiamine and niacin is enhanced.

During early age for 1-2 years. For lifetime exposure. Timingwhen the teeth are forming under the gums (<8 years age) Symptoms. Staining and pitting of the teeth, enamel damage. Stiffness and pain in the joints, bone structure may change and ligaments may calcify, impairment in muscle activity and pain. Acute high-level exposure to fluoride causes immediate effects of abdominal pain, excessive saliva, nausea and vomiting. Seizures and muscle spasms may also occur. Control: Removal of excessive fluoride from drinking- water is difficult and expensive. The preferred option is to find a supply of safe drinking-water with safe fluoride levels. Where access to safe water is already limited, de-fluoridation is the solution. Different de-fluoridation techniques: Use of bone charcoal, contact precipitation, use of Nalgonda (aluminum sulfate used) or activated alumina. Only water for drinking and cooking purposes should be treated as all methods produce sludge with very high concentration of fluoride.",

Discussion: OT test enables both free and combined chlorine in water. Add 0. 1ml of reagent to 1 ml of water. Yellow colour produced is matched against suitable standard colour. Modification is Orthotoludine Arsinite (OTA) test - to determine the free and combined chlorine separately. Also errors caused by the presence of interfering substances like nitrites, iron, manganese which also produce yellow colour to OT is overcome by OTA test. CHLORINATION# Chlorine kills pathogenic bacteria but it has no effect on spores and certain viruses (e. g., polio, viral hepatitis, protozoal cyst, helementhic).# The disinfecting action of chlorine is mainly due to hypochlorus acid. 0# Chlorine acts best as a disinfectant when pH of water is around 7, because of the predominance of hypochlorus acid.# When pH value exceeds 8. 5, it is unreliable as a disinfectant because about 90% of the hypochlorous acid gets ionized.# One tablet of chlorine, chlorinates 20 litres of water. 0# Principles of chlorination- Water should be clear and free from turbidity because turbidity impedes efficient chlorination.- The chlorine demand of the water should be estimated. If further chlorine is added to the water beyond break point, free chlorine begins to appear in the water.- The pesence of free residual chlorine for a contact period of at least one hour is essential to kill bacteria and viruses; the chlorine has no effect on spores, protozoal cysts and helminthic ovas.- The minimum recommended concentration of free chlorine is 0. 5 mg/L for one hour. The point at which the residual chlorine appears and all combined chlorines have been completely destroyed is the breakpoint and corresponding dosage is the break-point dosage. Presence of free residual chlorine for contact period of at least 1 hour. Orthotolidine Test# The yellow colour is produced by both free and combined chlorine residuals. The test is carried out by adding 0. 1 mL of the reagent to 1 mL of water. The colour produced after 15-20 minutes is due to the action of both free and combined chlorine.# In this test, 10 ml of chlorinated sample of water is taken after the required contact period, in a glass tube. To this 0. 1 mL of orthotolidine solution is added. The colour formed is observed after 5 minutes.# The formation of yellow colour normally indicates the presence of chlorine (either combined or free) in the water.# The more yellow the colour, the greater, is the chlorine residual.# The amount of residual chlorine can be ascertained by comparing the colour developed in the glass tube with the standard colours already kept in the laboratory.# This test, is therefore, very simple and does not require much technique or time. Under normal conditions, a lemon yellow colour is satisfactory for public water supply.# The orthotolidine test will normally give the total residual chlorine present in water. However, it may be adjusted so as to give separately the quantities of free residual as well as combined residual of chlorine.# The free residual chlorine forms the yellow colour during the first 5 seconds of the addition of orthotolidine, while the combined residual chlorine goes on forming the colour for about 5 minutes. Hence, the colour after 5 seconds will give the quantity of free residual chlorine, and the colour after 5 minutes will give the free and combined chlorine. The difference in value between the two values is the combined chlorine.# The orthotolidine test, however, is not accurate, because the impurities such as iron, manganese, nitrate etc., are likely to cause a false yellow colour, and indicating wrong and increased chlorine residual. To overcome this problem Orthotolidine - Arsenite (OT A) test is carried out. Now the different chlorine residuals can be easily determined as follows:# Free residual chlorine = (X2) - (XI)# Combine residual chlorine = (X3) - (X2)# In the orthotolidine test as well as in the OT A test, the temperature of water is to be controlled to room temperature.",

A healthful school environment therefore is necessary for thebest emotional, social and personal health of the pupils. Schools should also serve as demonstration centres of goodsanitation to the community. The following minimumstandards for sanitation of the school and its environs have been suggested in India (1) Location: The school should normally be centrally situated with proper approach roads and at a fair distance from busy places and roads, cinema houses, factories, railway tracks and market places. The school premises should be properly fenced and kept free from all hazards. (2) Site: The site should be on suitable high land, and not subject to inundation or dampness and can be properly drained. The School Health Committee {1961) had recommended that 10 acres of land be provided for higher elementary schools and 5 acres for primary schools with an additional one acre of land per 100 students. In congested areas, the nearest public park or playground should be made available to the students. {3) Structure: Nursery and secondary schools, as far as possible, be single storied. Exterior walls should have a minimum thickness of 10 inches and should be heat resistant. (4) Classroom: Verandhas should be attached to classrooms. No classroom should accommodate more than 40 students. Per capita space for students in a classroom should not be less than 10 sq. ft. (5) Furniture: Furniture should suit the age group of students. It is desirable to provide single desks and chairs. Desks should be of \"minus\" type. Chairs should be provided with proper back-rests, with facilities for desk-work. (6) Doors and windows: The windows should be broad with the bottom sill, at a height of 2'-6\" from the floor level; combined door and window area should be at least 25 per cent of the floor space; windows should be placed on different walls for cross-ventilation; the ventilators should not be less than 2 per cent of the floor area. (7) Colour: Inside colour of the classroom should be white and should be periodically white-washed. (8) Lighting: Classrooms should have sufficient natural light, preferably from the left, and should not be from the front. (9) Water supply: There should be an independent source of safe and potable water supply, which should be continuous, and distributed from the taps. (10) Eating facilities: Vendors other than those approved by the school authorities should not be allowed inside school premises; there should be a separate room provided for mid-day meals. (11) Lavatory: Privies and urinals should be provided one urinal for 60 students and one latrine for 100 students. Arrangements should be separately made for boys and girls.

Sulphur dioxide (S02) is a colourless gas with a sharp odour, results from the combustion of sulphur containing fossil fuel, the smelting of sulphur-containing ores, and other industrial processes. Domestic fires, power generation and motor vehicles can also produce emissions containing sulphur dioxide. S02 can affect the respiratory system and the function of lungs, and causes irritation of eyes. Inflammation of the respiratory tract causes coughing, mucus secretion, aggravation of asthma and chronic bronchitis, and makes people more prone to infections of the respiratory tract. Hospital admissions for cardiac disease and moality increase on days with higher S02 levels. When S02 combines with water, it forms sulphuric acid; this is the main component of acid rain which is a cause of deforestation. It causes deterioration of leather items. A S02 concentration of 500 ug/m3 should not be exceeded over average periods of 10 minutes duration. Studies indicate that a propoion of people with asthma experience changes in pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms after periods of exposure to S02 as sho as 10 minutes.

        "question": "Which among the following is the most effective form of Chlorine for water disinfection?",
        "exp": "(C) Hypochlorous acid[?]. Chlorination: o. Chlorination is one of the greatest advances in water purification. It is supplement, not a substitute to sand filtration. o. Action of chlorine: When chlorine is added to water, there is formation of Hydrochloric & Hypochlorous acids. o. Hydrochloric acid is neutralized by the alkalinity of the water. o. Disinfecting action of chlorine is mainly due to the hypochlorous acid, & to a small extent due to the hypochlorite ions. o. It is more effective (70-80 times) than the hypochlorite ion. o. Chlorine acts best as a disinfectant when the pH of water is around 7 because of the predominance of hypochlorous acid. o. When the pH value exceeds 8. 5 it is unreliable as a disinfectant because about 90 per cent of the hypochlorous acid gets ionized to hypochlorite ions. o. Principles of chlorination: Mere addition of chlorine to water is not chlorination. o. Rules to ensure proper chlorination:-First of all, the water to be chlorinated should be clear and free from turbidity. Turbidity impedes efficient chlorination-Secondly, \"chlorine demand\" of the water should be estimated.-Thirdly the contact period.-Presence of free residual chlorine for a contact period of at least one hour is essential to kill bacteria & viruses-Chlorine has no effect on spores, protozoal cysts and helminthic ova, except in higher doses.-The minimum recommended concentration of free chlorine is 0. 5mg/L for one hour.-Free residual chlorine provides a margin of safety against subsequent microbial contamination such as may occur during storage and distribution.-Sum of the chlorine demand of the specific water plus the free residual chlorine of 0. 5mg/L constitutes the correct dose of chlorine to be applied. [?]. Break Point Chlorination-Addition of chlorine to ammonia In water produces chloramines which do not have the same efficiency as free chlorine.-If chlorine dose in the water is increased, a reduction in the residual chlorine occurs, due to the destruction of chloramine by the added chlorine.-End products do not represent any residual chlorine.-Fall in residual chlorine will continue with further increase in chlorine dose and after a stage, the residual chlorine begins to increase in proportion to the added dose of chlorine.-This point at which the residual chlorine appears and when all combined chlorines have been completely destroyed is the breakpoint and corresponding dosage is the breakpoint dosage.-Breakpoint chlorination achieves the same results as superchlorination in a rational manner and can therefore be construed as controlled superchlorination. [?]. Super Chlorineo. Superchlorination followed by dechlorination comprises the addition of large doses of chlorine to the water, & removal of excess of chlorine after disinfection, this method is applicable to heavily polluted waters whose quality fluctuates greatly. [?]. Ortho Tolidine (OT) Test-Enables both free & combined chlorine in water to be determined with speed and accuracy.-Reagent consists Orthotolidine, dissolved in 10% solution of hydrochloric acid.-Reagent is added to water containing chlorine, it turns yellow & intensity of the colour varies with the concentration of the gas.-Yellow colour is produced by both free & combined chlorine residuals.-OT reacts with free chlorine instantaneously but reacts more slowly with combined chlorine.-Test is carried out by adding 0. 1 ml of the reagent to 1 ml of water.-Yellow colour produced is matched against suitable standards or colour discs.-It is essential to take the reading within 10 seconds after addition of reagent to estimate free chlorine in water-Colour that is produced after a lapse, say 15-20 minutes, is due to the action of both free and combined chlorine. [?]. Ortho Tolidine-Arsenite (OTA) Test-Modification of the OT test to determine free & combined chlorine residuals separately.-Errors caused by the presence of interfering substances such as nitrites, iron & manganese all of which produce a yellow colour with Orthotolidine, are overcome by the OTA test.",

Black. Plastic bag* Category 5: Discarded medicines and Cytotoxic drugs* Category 9: Incineration Ash (Ash from any biomedical waste)* Category 10: Chemical used in disinfectants* Disposal in secured landfill. Note: Recent amendment (2011) of the biomedical management rules says Red bin for Category 4 (sharps), but this amendment is yet to be implemented. Also, one of the options, blue white translucent is not there in new amendment. So, I assume the question was based on old BMM rules. So the best option is blue with white translucent. Main Features of the New Amendment: Scope of BMW rules extended to all health facilities (occupier) irrespective of number of patients attending. New rule says compulsory authorization from prescribed authority (CPCB) to start any new health facility is required with regard to its biomedical waste disposal plans. Earlier only facility which caters to more than 1000 patients per month was required to get authorization. There are only 8 categories (old 10 categories) (liquid waste and ash is removed, chemical waste is made as 8* category). New bins are yellow, red, blue and black. There is an overlapping of category 3 and 6 which can be put either red or yellow as per existing rule, but new amendment exclusively say 3 in red and 6 in yellow. Category 7 in overlap was there earlier, nut new rule says it should go to red bin. Sharps in red bin as per new rules. Black bin-general waste. New rules applies only to biomedical waste and not for other waste like radioactive and chemical waste. Note: Liquid waste generated from laboratory, washing, cleaning, house keeping and disinfecting activities shall be treated so as to meet the discharge standards stipulated under these rules. Incineration ash (Ash from incineration of any Biomedical waste) shall be disposed through secured landfill, if toxic or hazardous constituents are present beyond the prescribed limits as given in Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules (2008).",

Since the life cycle of a mosquito is about 8 days, its customary to apply oil once in a week on all breeding places. Other anti-larval measures include source reduction, using Paris green, and synthetic insecticides. Biological control with larvivorous fishes like Gambusia and Lebister.
