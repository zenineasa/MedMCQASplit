        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e. Panel Discussion Methods of group approaches in health communication: Chalk and talk (lecture): It is a carefully prepared oral presentation of facts organized thoughts and ideas by a qualified person. The chalk lends the visual component. The group should not be more than 30 and the talk should not exceed 15-20 minute. Group Discussion: A group is an aggregation of people interacting in a face to face situation. A group should not comprise less than 6 and not more than 12 members*. Panel Discussion: In a panel discussion, 4 to 8 qualified persons talk about a topic and discuss a given problem in front of a large group or audience. Symposium: A symposium is a series of speeches on a selected subject. There is no discussion among the symposium members like in panel discussion. Workshop: It consists of a series of meeting usually four or more, with emphasis on individual work, within the group, with the help of consultants and resource personnel. The total workshop may be divided into small groups and each group will solve and discuss a problem with the help of consultants. Role Playing: Role Playing is a socio-drama based on assumptions that many values in a situation cannot be expressed in words and the communication can be more effective if the situation is dramatised by the group. Demonstration: It is a carefully prepared presentation to show how to perform a skill or procedure. Here procedure (eg. disinfection of well, preparation of ORS) is carried out step by step before an audience or the target group. Teaching about ORS in slums is best done by demonstration. *Conferences and Seminars",
