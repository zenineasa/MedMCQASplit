Environmental control (Source reduction) Source reduction means elimination of the breeding places of mosquitoes. This is the most impoant step in controlling mosquitoes. Source reduction methods include: - Minor engineering methods such as filling, leveling and drainage of breeding places - Water management (such as intermittent irrigation) - Changing the salinity of water (this makes water unsuitable for mosquito breeding) b. Chemical control Chemical control methods are: i) Mineral oil- oil spreads on water forming a thin film, which cut off the air supply to the mosquito larvae and pupae ii) Paris Green- It is a stomach poison (that is it must be ingested in order to work). It mainly kills the Anopheles larvae because they are surface feeders. Bottom feeding larvae are also killed when Paris green is applied as a special granular formulation. iii) Synthetic insecticides? The common synthetic larvicides used are: Abate, Malathion, Fenthion, and Chloropyrifos The organochlorine compounds e. g. DDT, HCH are not used for larviciding operations because of their long residual effect, water contamination and increased risk of developing resistance in the vector mosquitoes. c. Biological control- it includes larva eating fishes such as Gambusia affinis and Lebister reticulates. Anti-adult measures a. Residual sprays- e. g. DDT. Lindane, Malathion, OMS-33. DDT is the insecticide of choice. b. Space sprays- Space sprays are those that are sprayed into the atmosphere in the form of a mist or fog to kill mosquitoes. e. g. Pyrethrum, Malathion, Fenitrothion c. Genetic control These include sterile male technique, cytoplasmic incompatibility, chromosomal translocations, sex distoion, and gene replacement.

Oneto one causal relationship - Two variables are causally related if a change in one variable is followed by a change in the other. So when the disease is present, the factor must also be present. In the given stud)' causative. factor is not being studied rather preventive factor is being studied. 2. Multifactorial causation - There can be multiple factors acting independently or cumulatively to produce a disease (non-communicable). As stated above causal. factors are not being observed in this study so both causal association and multtfactorial causation are ruled out. Common association is not an epidemiological term, it is just a casual term.",

Three such distributions are impoant in medicine; Binomial and Poisson distributions are discrete probability distributions of a variable that can have only two outcomes (yes or no). The associated random variable can take only integer values, 0, 1, 2, 3... n. Normal (Gaussian) distribution is continuous, so it can take on any values. The curve is inveed, bell shaped and smooth. The peak represents the mean, median and mode all of which coincide. The variation is measured by standard detion. The area under the curve is equal to 1(because it is a probability distribution). The area on the left half of the mean is equal to the area on the right half of the mean. We use the standard normal distribution curve, which has a mean of 0 and a standard detion of 1. It is also called the z-distribution. 68. 2% of all values lie between -1 and + 1 SD around the mean. 95. 4% of all values lie between -2 and +2 SD. Poisson's Distribution In probability theory and statistics Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a number of events occurring in a fixed period of time if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. It can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume. The distribution was discovered by Simeon Denis Poisson. The work focused on ceain random variables N that count, among other things, a number of discrete occurrences (sometimes called arrivals) that take place during a time interval of given length.

The collation of information allows the authorities to monitor the disease, and provides early warning of possible outbreaks. Many governments have enacted regulations for repoing of both human and animal (generally livestock) diseases. This usually happens during pandemics. The World Health Organization's International Health Regulations 1969 require disease repoing to the organization in order to help with its global surveillance and advisory role. The current (1969) regulations are rather limited with a focus on repoing of three main diseases: Cholera Plague Yellow fever Louse-borne typhus, relapsing fever, influenza, poliomyelitis, malaria, rabies and salmonellosis are subject to international surveillance.",

Specificity It is the ability of a test to identify correctly those who do not have the disease i. e., true negative In other words specificity measures the percentage of well people who are identified as not having the disease.

Dietary fibre absorbs water in the intestine, swells, increase bulk of stood by increasing water content of faeces and soften it, decreases transit time by facilitating colonic transit. \"The presence of fibre shoens the transit times and increases the stool bulk\" Dietary fibre is of two types: Soluble fibres: It absorbs upto 15 times its weight in water as it moves through GIT, producing softer stools. Its good sources are oat, flaxseeds, peas, beans, apple, citrus fruits, carrots, barley and psyllium. Insoluble fibre: It promotes movement of material through digestive system and increases stool bulk. Its good sources are wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts and vegetables. Advantages of fibres Dietry fibre contribute bulk by absorbing water 1-15 times of its own weight and thus hastens the passage through the gut, decreasing the transient time. By increasing the bulk, it provides a larger volume of indigestible material to colon. Dietary fibre is known to be associated with reduced incidence of coronary aery diseases. The mechanism of its action is attributed to its binding to bile salts and preventing its absorption and thus reducing cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) level in circulation. The fibre, paicularly the gum and pectin, when ingested with a diet, are repoed to reduce post-prandial glucose level in blood - helpful in DM. Dietary fibre reduce the incidence of diveiculitis, constipation, hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome and colon cancer.",

        "exp": "Ans. C: Commonly spreads by faeco-oral Poliomyelitis is caused by infection with a member of the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses prefers to inhabit the gastrointestinal tract. PV infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its structure is very simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified-poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)- each with a slightly different capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis. The virus may be rapidly inactivated by pasteurization. Individuals who are exposed to the virus, either through infection or by immunization with polio vaccine, develop immunity. In immune individuals, IgA antibodies against poliovirus are present in the tonsils and gastrointestinal tract and are able to block virus replication; IgG and IgM antibodies against PV can prevent the spread of the virus to motor neurons of the central nervous system. Infection or vaccination with one serotype of poliovirus does not provide immunity against the other serotypes, and full immunity requires exposure to each serotype Poliomyelitis is highly contagious and spreads easily by human-to-human contact. Incubation period is usually between 7 to 14 days, with a maximum range of 3 to 35 days. Virus paicles are excreted in the feces for several weeks following initial infection. The disease is transmitted primarily the fecal-oral route, by ingesting contaminated food or water. It is occasionally transmitted the oral-oral route, a mode especially visible in areas with good sanitation and hygiene. Polio is most infectious between 7-10 days before and 7-10 days after the appearance of symptoms, but transmission is possible as long as the virus remains in the saliva or feces Man is the only known reservoir of infection. Most infections are subclinical. They form the submerged poion of the iceberg. It is estimated that for every clinical case, there may be 1000 subclinical cases in children and 75 in adults.",

Anti-rabies vaccine is given for Category II and III exposures. Anti-rabies immunoglobin, or antibody, should be given for Category III contact, or to people with weaker immune systems. Post-exposure treatment should sta right away and only be stopped if the animal is a dog or cat and remains healthy after 10 days.",

Uses of Lepromin test 1)to evaluate the immune status (cell mediated immunity) of leprosy patients 2)in classifying the disease 3 )to estimate the prognosis of leprosy patients. Procedure and Inference This test is performed by injecting intradermally 0. 1 ml of lepromin into the inner aspect of the forearm. Reaction is read at 48 hrs and 21 days. Two types of positive reactions have been described. a). Early Reaction or Fernandez reaction - this appears as an area of redness and induration at the site of inoculation - it develops within 24 to 48 hrs and disappears after 3 to 4 days. - the reading is taken at 48 hrs, and if the area of redness is more than 10 mm, the test is considered positive. b). Late Reaction or Mitsuda reaction - this reaction develops late, becoming apparent in 7-10 days following the infection and reaches peak in 3 or 4 weeks. A nodule develops at the site of inoculation. - the reading is taken at 21 days and if the nodule is more than 5 mm in diameter, the reaction is said to be positive. The early reaction is induced by soluble constituents of the leprosy bacilli; and the late reaction by the bacillary component of the antigen. The early positive reaction indicates whether or not a person has been previously sensitized by exposure to an infection by leprosy bacilli. It is thus more superior to late reaction. The early reaction corresponds to the Mantoux reaction in tuberculosis. In the first 6 months of life, most children are lepromin negative; gradually with increasing age more and more persons become positive. BCG vaccination can conve lepra reactions, from negative to positive in large no. of individuals",

A) Disease to be screened The disease should be an important health problem with a recognizable latent or asymptomatic stage. There should be a test (screening test) which can detect the disease prior to clinical stage, with also availability of a diagnostic (confirmatory) test. There should be an effective treatment which should reduce morbidity and mortality if started early. B) Screening test to be applied The screening test to be applied should fulfil following criteria 1) Acceptibility The test should be acceptable to the people whom it is aimed. 2) Repeatability (reliability) The test must give consistent results when it is repeated more than once on the same individual under same condition, i. e. results of test must by precise (exact). Thus, repeatability is also known as precision, reliability or reproducibility. 3) Validity (accuracy) It refers to what extent the test accurately measures which is purports to measure. Validity has two componens: i) Sensitivity ii) Specificity. A test should have high sensitivity and specificity",

Following impoant points require specific mention here:? o Though qualitative (categorial) data do not have numerical value, some times numerical value is used to classify the limit of qualitative data. For example: - 1). All low bih weight children will have bih weight less than 2500 gm. So, a) Bih weight (which may be 2200 gm, 2500 gm, 2600 gm) is a continuous variable. b). Low bih weight (< 2500 gm) is a qualitative data because either a newborn have low bih weight or not. 2) Blood cholesterol level (which may be 70, 80, 90, 200 mg/dl) is a quantitative variable but when it comes high or low blood cholesterol level, it becomes qualitative variable because a preson may either have low or high cholesterol level. 3) Similarly blood sugar level is quantitative variable, while high or low blood sugar (presence or absence of diabetes) is a qualitative variable. 4) Blood hemoglobin is a quantitative variable, while high or low hemoglobin (Presence or absence of anemia) is a qualitative variable. Note: o Pulse rate (PR) is considered as a continuous variable. o Immediately question comes to mind that how can pulse rate be a continues variable when pulse rate can only be 70/71... beats per minute but not in between value (70. 1, 70. 5...). However, this is only true when we count pulse for only 1 minute. In other scenario, if the pulse rate is counted for 3 minutes and it comes 216, then the pulse rate will be 72. 3 beats per minute ---> Therefore, pulse rate is considered as a continuous variable. o If you still have doubt, read following statement? \"Body temperature, pulse rate, height, weight, and age are all continuous numerical variables\".. statistics for health care professional.",

C: 0. 5 to 3 microns Dust paicle within the range of 0. 5-3 micron, is a health hazard producing, after a variable exposure, a lung disease known as pneumoconiosis Common Occupational Lung Diseases Asbestosis, caused by exposure to asbestos paicles. Often found among people who worked in shipyards, asbestos mines, and factories that refined or used asbestos to manufacture products. Black lung (Coalworker's pneumoconiosis) which affects coal workers Chronic Beryllium disease (CBD), which affects workers in a variety of metallurgical occupations Byssinosis (brown lung disease), often occurs in cotton and textile workers when bacteria released from cotton or other materials is inhaled and grows with the lungs. This is often associated with poor ventilation systems. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, this can affect people who work in office buildings whose air-conditioning systems are contaminated by ceain fungi and bacteria. Occupational asthma, can affect people who work with a variety of materials. This includes animals (dander), carbamates (urethanes), dyes, epoxy resins and enzymes used in detergent, leather goods, latex, and automotive paints Silicosis often developed by people who worked with clay, sand and stone dust including miners, stone cutters and sandblasters. How Diseases Develop Pneumoconiosis is the classification of diseases that develop as the result of occupational exposure to dust. Occupational lung diseases develop based on the size and type of paicles inhaled and where the inhaled paicle end up. Larger paicles are more likely to get stuck in the nose and larger airways but smaller paicles can reach the alveoli where they can potentially be absorbed into the bloodstream. When inhaled paicles come in contact with the wall of the airway they do not become airborne again. This is called deposition and can occur in one of four ways: - Sedimentation: When gravity causes paicles to settle, tends to occur in larger airways. - Ineial impaction: Often occurs in the nose and larger airways, it happens when an airway changes direction - Interception: This form of deposition occurs with fibrous dust paicles (including asbestos fibers) or any other irregular shaped paicles. Due to their shape they often avoid deposition by sedimentation or ineial impaction but are deposited in the walls of the bronchioles which are lined with epithelial cells. - Diffusion: Behavior of small aerosol paicles which encounter and are affected by molecules of air. During regular breathing (at rest) about 10% of compact paicles of 0. 5 to 1 micron diameter are deposited in the alveoli with the vast majority being exhaled.",

It is the amount of chlorine that is needed to destroy bacteria and to oxidize all the organic matter and ammoniacal substances present in water. Chlorine demand of water is the difference between the amount of chlorine added to the water and the amount of residual chlorine remaining at the end of specific period of contact (usually 60 minutes) at a given temperature and pH of the water. The point at which the chlorine demand of the water is met is called break point chlorination. If further chlorine is added beyond break point, free chlorine begins to appear in water. The presence of free residual chlorine for a contact period of at least one hour is essential to kill bacteria and virus. The minimum recommended concentration of free chlorine is 0. 5mg/i for one hour. This free residual chlorine provides margin of safety against subsequent microbial contamination. The sum of the chlorine demand of the specific water plus the free residual chlorine of. 5 mg/L constitutes the correct does of chlorine to be applied. It is worth noting here that recommended residual chlorine level for drinking water is 0. 5 mg/ litre, while for swimming pool sanitation it is 1. 0 mg/ litre and for water bodies & post disaster it is 0. 7 mg/litre",

        "exp": "Risk B has the strongest association [Ref: http://www. thedoctorsdoctorcom/labtests/statistics. htm Odds ratio is a measure of the strength of the association between risk factor and the outcome. It is used to assess the risk of a paicular outcome (or disease) if a ceain factor (or exposure) is present. The odds ratio is a relative measure of risk, telling us how much more likely it is that someone who is exposed to the factor under study will develop the outcome as compared to someone who is not exposed. Odds ratio is the ratio of the odds that a case was exposed to the odds that a control was exposed. Odds ratio = = It can vary from 0 to infinity. For example: The data in the table below is information about infant bih weights and moality among white infants in New York City in 1974. Dead Alive Total Low bih wt. 618 4, 597 5, 215 Norm bih wt. 422 67, 093 67, 515 Total 1, 040 71, 690 72, 730 The odds ratio for death in one year is OR= This odds ratio illustrates that moality is far more likely in the low bih weight group Internreating Odd's Ratios In order to interperate the odds ratio we need to calculate a confidence interval. We can say that a proposed risk factor acts as a significant risk to disease if the odds ratio is greater than one and the lower bound of the confidence interval does not include 1. Confidence interval The 95% confidence interval (or 95% confidence limits) would include 95% of results from studies of the same size and design in the same population. This is close but not identical to saying that the true size of the effect (never exactly known) has a 95% chance of falling within the confidence interval. If the 95% confidence interval for a relative risk (RR) or an odds ratio (OR) includes 1, then this is taken as no evidence of an effect. The practical advantages of a confidence interval (rather than a P value) is that they present the range of likely effects. Odds Ratio 95% confidence interval does not include 1 Interpretation 1 Yes No association >1 Yes Positive association between exposure and outcome at the 5% significance level (the odds of exposure is greater in cases than in controls) <1 Yes Negative association between exposure and outcome at the 5% significance level (the odds of exposure is smaller in cases than controls) 95% confidence interval does include 1 Association of exposure and outcome is not proved by the study at the 5% significance level An odds ratio of 1 indicates that a person with the disease is no more likely to have been exposed to the risk factor than is a person without the disease, suggesting that the risk factor is not related to the disease.

        "exp": "According to Alma-Ata declaration (1978), \"Health education is a process aimed at encouraging people to want to be healthy to know how to stay healthy to do what they can individually and collectively to maintain health and seek help when needed\". Health education is the act of getting people to do something for themselves to attain better health. Health education involves teaching about reducing health risk factors, increasing a person's level of wellness and taking specific protective health measures. There are 4 well-known approaches to health education - 1. Regulatory approach (Managed prevention) There are occasions when people are indifferent to their own health thus endangering the health of the community, in which case the regulatory or legal approach seeks to protect the health of the public through the enforcement of laws and regulations. The regulatory approach involves governmental intervention designed to alter human behavior through regulations ranging from prohibition to imprisonment. This approach seeks change in health behavior and improvement in health through a variety of external controls or legislations. E. g. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, compulsory seat belts. 2. Service approach The service approach involves providing necessary health services needed by the people as and when required through the spirit of volunteerism or social obligation. This is mainly the responsibility of the health department and health workers both in government and non-government health agencies. The service or administrative approach aims at providing all the health facilities needed by the community so that the people will make use of them in order to improve their own health. The service approach will be a failure when it is not based on the \"felt needs\" of the people. 3. Health education approach The health education approach involves changing the behavioral patterns of the people through planned learning experiences without conflicting with the masses. It involves proper communication and motivation of the community to make the right decision in order to attain health. Though it is a good method, it is a slow perseverance to have permanent and enduring results. E. g. cessation of smoking, use of safe water supply, fertility control. 4. Primary health care approach The primary health care approach involves enabling individuals to become self-reliant in matters of health. This is a radically new approach starting from the people with their full participation and active involvement in the planning and delivery of health services based on principals of primary health care, viz community involvement and intersectoral coordination. The underlying objective is to help individuals become self-reliant in matters of health. Mass media is a method of health communication. (Park 20\"/e p. 766, 768)",

        "question": "Group of 4-8 expes talking in front of a large group of audience is known as: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. D: Panel Discussion In a panel discussion, 4-8 persons who are qualified to talk about the topic sit and discuss a given problem, or the topic, in front of a large group of audience Panel Discussion A panel consists of a small group of four or eight persons, who carry on a guided and informal discussion before an audience as if the panel were meeting alone. The proceedings of the panel should be the same as those described for informal discussion: volunteering of facts, asking questions, stating opinions-all expressed with geniality, with respect for the contributions of other members, without speech making, and without making invidious personal references. This primary function should occupy approximately two-thirds of the allotted time-say foy minutes of an hour's meeting. The secondary function of the panel is to answer questions from the audience. This discussion method is suitable for use when a relatively large audience is anticipated. The disadvantage of the method is that it confines most of the discussion to the panel itself. The audience listens and is given a chance to ask questions, but for the most pa is passive and receptive. Panel discussions, if well conducted, are usually more interesting to the audience than is the single-speaker forum. They provide sufficiently varied clash of opinion and presentation of facts to give even the quiet members of the audience a feeling of vicarious paicipation. Quality and tasks of leadership in panel discussion are similar to those described for informal discussion. The leader must in addition take special care to select panel members who can think and speak effectively. He must also be sure that they prepare themselves to discuss the subject. During the discussion by the panel the leader has substantially the same duties as in informal discussion except that he should keep himself more in the background as chairman of the panel. He can do so because each member of the panel is in reality an assistant to the leader and is responsible for specific contributions to the proceedings. When the subject is thrown open to the house, it is the leader's job to recognize appropriate questions and to reject those not bearing on the subject or involving personalities. Some questions he may answer himself, but usually he should repeat the question and call upon one of the panel to answer it. By preliminary announcement the leader may also tell the audience that they may direct questions at paicular members of the panel if they choose. In any case, during the question period the leader needs to maintain strict control. On many occasions this may be the toughest pa of his assignment to carry off efficiently and with good humor. While it is customary to confine audience questions to a specific period, some leaders permit questions from the floor at any time. Unless very carefully limited by the leader, this practice may interfere with effective discussion by the panel. Arranging the panel properly will lend effectiveness to this form of discussion. The members should face the audience. It is impoant that each panel member adjust his chair so that he can see every other member without effo the chairman will also find that the best places for his readiest speakers are at the extreme ends of the table. He should keep the more reticent members close to, him so that he can readily draw them out with direct questions. If the quieter ones sit on the fringes of the panel, the more voluble members are quite likely to monopolize the discussion.",

C: Escherichia coli Coliforms: Gram-negative, non spore-forming, oxidase-negative, rod-shaped facultative anaerobic bacteria that ferment lactose to acid and gas within 24-48h at 36+-2degC. Not specific indicators of fecal pollution. Thermotolerant coliforms: Coliforms that produce acid and gas from lactose at 44. 5+-0. 2degC within 24+-2h, also known as fecal coliforms due to their role as fecal indicators. Escherichia coli (E. coli): Thermophilic coliforms that produce indole from tryptophan. Most appropriate group of coliforms to indicate fecal pollution from warm-blooded animals. Fecal streptococci (FS): Gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci from selective media (e. g. azide dextrose broth or m Enterococcus agar) that grow on bile aesculin agar and at 45degC, belonging to the genera Enterococcus and Streptococcus possessing the Lancefield group D antigen. Enterococci: All fecal streptococci that grow at pH 9. 6, 10deg and 45degC and in 6. 5% Na. C1. Nearly all are members of the genus Enterococcus, and also fulfil the following criteria: resistance to 60degC for 30 min and ability to reduce 0. 1% methylene blue. The enterococci are a subset of fecal streptococci that grow under the conditions outlined above. Sulphite-reducing clostridia (SRC): Gram-positive, spore-forming, non-motile, strictly anaerobic rods that reduce sulphite to H2S.

In the example comparing the occurence of hepatitis B surface antigen in medical and dental students, use of chi square analysis is appropriate because the outcome variables are dichomatous. Students are classified by the presence or absence of HBs. Ag. Student t test is used when the outcome variable is normally distributed in population (for quantitative data) e. g blood pressure, blood glucose. In the example student t test is used to assess the difference between mean systolic pressure of pregnant and non pregnant women ( to know the effect of pregnancy on mean systolic blood pressure) because mean systolic blood pressure is normally distributed in the population. Every single lady has a mean systolic blood pressure. It may be low or high, but she has a value of mean systolic blood pressure. Students t test may be following types: Unpaired t test (Independent t test): It compares the mean of two small samples: The data is unpaired from two independent sample. for example, blood sugar concentration is measured in two different group (A group of 10 patients and other group of 8 patient). To test the significance of difference between the means of the two groups, unpaired t test is used. Paired t test: It compares the mean in paired data, before and after the intervention from same sample. For example, Blood sugar level in a sample of 10 patients is measure before giving and after giving the oral hypoglycemic. In this condition paired t test is used. Chi-square test Vs Student t test In the example student t test is used to assess the difference between mean systolic pressure of pregnant and non pregnant women ( to know the effect of pregnancy on mean systolic blood pressure) because mean systolic blood pressure is normally distributed in the population. Every single lady has a mean systolic blood pressure. It may be low or high, but she has a value of mean systolic blood pressure. But suppose we change the example in a way that we make a clear cut definition of hypertension ( such as mean systolic blood pressure over 140 mm of Hg will be taken to be hypertension) and then look for hypertension among pregnant and non-pregnant women. The test now used to analyse the outcome will be chi square test since the outcomes are now in the form of dichomatous data i. e yes or no (a woman is either hypeensive or not hypeensive. This is in contrast to mean systolic blood pressure which was normally distributed among ladies; every lady had one value of mean systolic blood pressure). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (F test/ F ratio) ANOVA is considered as an extension of the student t test for the significance of the difference between two sample means. The student t test can be used only for making just one comparison (between two sample means), or between a sample mean and hypothesized population mean. ANOVA is used when more than one comparison is to be made (When means of more than two groups are being compared). For example, BP is measured in more than two groups of men (married, unmarried, widowed, separated and divorced). In this situation ANOVA test is best.",

It is a specific granuloma of the skin, endemic within ceain limited areas in warm countries; characterized primarily by a papule, gradually enlarging by peripheral and subjacent infiltration, with scaling or crusting, and which usually, sometimes with an inter-vening furunculoid stage, slowly breaks down and develops into an indolent ulcer. The disease takes the form of a slow-healing open sore or ulcer, which sometimes becomes secondarily infected with bacteria. Leishmania donovani causes kala-azar. Leishmania braziliensis causes muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis",

The following epidemiological-indices are used in tuberculosis problem measurement and programme strategy:? 1. Prevalence of infection It is the percentage of individuals who show a positive reaction to the standard tuberculin test. 2. Incidence of infection (Annual infection rate) It is the percentage of population under study who will be newly infected by M. tuberculosis among the non-infected of the preceding survey during the course of one year. It reflects the annual risk of being infected (or reinfected) in a given community, i. e. it expresses the attacking force of tuberculosis in a community. It is also known as tuberculin conversion index. This parameter is considered one of the best indicators for evaluating the tuberculosis problem and its trend. 3. Prevalence of disease or case rate It is the percentage of individuals whose sputum is positive for tubercle bacilli on microscopic examination. It is the best available practical index to estimate the number of infectious cases or case load in a community. 4. Incidence of new cases It is the percentage of new TB cases (confirmed by bacteriological examination) per 1000 population occurring during one year. 5. Prevalence of suspected cases This is based on X-ray examination of chest. 6. Prevalence of drug resistant cases It is the prevalence of patient excreting tubercle bacilli resistant to anti-tubercular drugs. 7. Moality rate The number of deaths from tuberculosis every year per 1, 000 population. In this question Option a - Prevalance of infection. Option b - Incidence of infection (annual infection rate).

It occurs when the vaccination of a poion of the population (or herd) provides protection to unprotected (non-vaccinated) individuals. How does herd immunity provide protection to nonimmunized person? o Infection is spread from person to person. o If a large number of population are immune, it is more difficult to maintain a chain of infection. o The more immune individuals present in a population, the lower the likelihood that a susceptible person will come into contact with an infected individual. o For example, if person 'A' had a disease and exposed person 'B' who was immune because of vaccination, person `B' would not get ill and could not pass on the disease to person 'C' when he comes into contact with him. So, even if person 'C' is not vaccinated, He indirectly gets protection from the disease. o Hence herd immunity may be used to reduce spread of an infection and to protect a vulnerable, un-vaccinated subgroup.",

The objective is to prevent the transition of the disease proecess from impairment to handicap. The sequence of events leading to disability and handicap are: Disease ---> impairment -4 disability -4 handicap Impairment - is defined as any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological or anatomical structure or function eg. loss of foot, defective vision or mental retardation. Disability - it is inability to carry out ceain activities considered normal for human beings, because of his 'impairment'. Handicap means that the individual with 'disability' is not able to perform his duties and obligations expected of him in the society. For example: Accident is the disease (or disorder) Loss of foot is the impairment Cannot walk is the disability Unemployed is the handicap Lets see other Modes of intervention in the disease process. Modes of Intervention Modes of intervention can be defined as any attempt to interrupt the usual sequence of any disease process (right from the risk factors to handicap) There are 5 modes of intervention: Health promotion Specific protection Early diagnosis Disability limitation Rehabilitation I. Health promotion Health promotion is not directed against any paicular disease, but is intended to improve the health of people through a variety of interventions like: i) Health education ii) Environmental modifications - Like provision of safe water, installation of sanitary latrines, control of insects and rodents etc. iii) Nutritional interventions - Like food foification, child feeding programmes. iv) Lifestyle and behavioural changes 2. Specific protection is directed against specific disease through interventions such as: - Immunization - Chemoprophylaxis - Protection from carcinogens etc. 3. Early diagnosis and treatment It involves detecting and treating the disease while the biochemical morphological and functional changes are still reversible. Thus it prevents ove disease and disablement. Early diagnosis and treatment are the only effective mode of intervention in following diseases. - Tuberculosis - Leprosy - STD 4. Disability limitation - Already described 5. Rehabilitation It is the combined and coordinated use of medical, social, educational and vocational measures for enabling the handicapped persons to achieve social integration (social integration is defined as the active paicipation of disabled and handicapped people in the mainstream of community life) Option 'a' - Reducing occurence of polio by immunization is specific protection Option 'b' - Arranging for schooling of child suffering from PRPP is rehabilitation Option 'c' - Resting affected limbs in neutral position disability limitation Option 'd' - Providing calipers for walking rehabilitation",

The importance of society lies in the fact that it controls and regulates the behavior of the individual both by law and customs. It can exert pressure on the individuals to conform to its norms.

In contrast to socialism, Capitalism is an economic and social system in which most trade and industry are privately controlled for profit rather than by the state.

Mechanism of action of slow sand filter Slow sand filter work through the, formation of a gelatinous layer called vital layer or hypogeal layer or Schmutzdecke in the top few cm of sand layer. This layer is formed in the first 10-20 days of operation. The formation of vital layer is known as \"Ripening of the filter\". This vital layer consists of bacteria, fungi, Protozoa, and a range of aquatic insect larvae. As waste passes through vital layer, particles of foreign matter are trapped in the mucilaginous matrix and dissolved organic material is absorbed and metabolized by bacterial, fungi and protozoa -> Vital layer has mechanical (physical) as well as biological action.
