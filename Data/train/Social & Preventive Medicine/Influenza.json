Seasonal trendo Some diseases show seasonal variations. o These changes are related to environmental conditions e. g., rainfall, overcrowding, humidity etc. o Examples are -i) Measlesii) Varicella (chicken pox)}- Early springiii) Upper respiratory' tract infection - Winteriv) GIT infection (including polio)v) Cerebrospinal meningitisvi) Rubella - late winter and springvii) Dengue - (in India). Cyclic trendo Some diseases occur in cyclic spread over a short period of time which may be week, days, months or years, o This is due to naturally occuring variation in herd immunity. o A build up of susceptible is again required in the herd before there can be another attack, o It may be due to antigenic variations as occur in influenza, o Examples - Epidemic ofi) Measlesii) Rubellaiii) Pandemic of influenza- every 2-3 years- every 6-9 years- every 10-15 years. Long term or secular trendso The term secular trend implies changes in the occurrence of disease over a long period of time, generally several years or decades. o There may be progressive increase or decrease in the occurrence of disease, o Examples -CHD, lung cancer, and DM have shown a consistent upward trend in developed countries. TB, typhoid fever, diphtheria and polio have shown a declined trend in developed countries.",
