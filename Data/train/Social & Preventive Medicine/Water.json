Reasons why foliform organisms are chosen as indicators of fecal pollution rater than the water borne pathogens directly* Constant presence of coliform organisms in great abundance in human intestine. These organisms are foreign to potable water. Therefore their presence is looked upon as evidence of fecal contamination.* They are easily detected by culture methods* Longer survival as compared to other water borne pathogens* They have greater resistance to the forces of natural purification, as compared to water borne pathogens. Other Indicators Include* Faecal streptococci: Faecal streptococci regularly occur in faeces, but in much smaller numbers than E. coll. Their presence is regarded as important confirmatory evidence of recent faecal pollution of water.* Cl. perfringens: They also occur regularly in faeces and their spores are capable of surviving in water for a longer time than organisms of the coliform group. So, the presence of spores in the absence of the coliform group, suggests that faecal contamination occurred at some remote time.",

Explanation: The residual chlorine that remains at the end of one hour contact period is called the 'free residual chlorine'. The purpose of residual chlorine is to provide margin of safety against contamination during storage and distribution. The minimum concentration of free residual chlorine for drinking purpose should be 0. 5 mg/ litre or 0. 5 parts per million. Free residual chlorine is detected by ortho toludine test using chloroscope / chlorotex apparatus. During a threat of outbreak of water borne epidemic we do super chlorination when the free residual chlorine is more than 2mg/litre. Such high levels may irritate throat, nose and eye. Hence this is followed with dechlorination by controlled addition of sodium thiosulphate or activated carbon.",

ALSO KNOW: Most effective and cheapest method of chlorination of wells in rural India is by bleaching powder (chlorination). Bleaching powder contains 33 % of chlorine content, is unstable with rapid and brief action. PERCHLORON (High test hypochloride) is a calcium compound which contains 60-70 % available chlorine. Chlorine demand of well w. Tater is estimated by Horrock's Apparatus. Roughly 2. 5 gms of bleaching powder is required to disinfect 1000 lit of water. One tablet of chlorine (0. 5 gm) can disinfect 20 liters of water. Chlorine acts best as a disinfectant w. Then the pH of water is around 7 because of the predominance of hypochlorous acid. This wdll give an approximate dose of 0. 7 mg of applied chlorine per liter of water. A contact period of 1 hour is allowed before the w. Tater is drawn for use. At the end of 1 hour the residual chlorine is tested by \"ORTHOTOLIDINE ARSENITE TEST\" (modification of Orthotolidine test) Orthotolidine test = 0. 1 ml of reagent + 1 ml of water (read after 10 sec) Orthotolidine reagent = Orthotolidine + 10% solution of HCLIf free residual chlorine level is less than 0. 5mg/litre, the chlorination procedure should be repeated before any water is drawn.
