It is satisfactory means of disposing excreta & liquid wastes from individual dwellings, small groups of houses & institutions which have adequate water supplies but do not have access to a public sewerage system. Main design features of septic tank are: - Capacity : Depends on number of users. A capacity of 20-30 gallons or 2 and half to 5 c.ft. / person is recommended for household septic tanks. Minimum capacity of a septic tank= at least 500 gallons. - Length is usually twice the breadth. - Depth = 1.5 to 2 m (5-7 ft.). - Recommended liquid depth = 1.2 m (4 ft.). - There should be a minimum air space of 30 cm (12 in.) b/w level of liquid in tank & undersurface of cover. - There are submerged inlet & outlet pipes. - In some septic tanks, bottom is sloping towards inlet end, facilitating retention of solids as sludge. - Septic tank is covered by a concrete slab of suitable thickness & provided with manhole. - These are designed in this country to allow a retention period of 24 hours. Too long retention period will result in undue septicity of effluent.

These organisms are foreign to potable water. Therefore their presence is looked upon as evidence of fecal contamination.* They are easily detected by culture methods* Longer survival as compared to other water borne pathogens* They have greater resistance to the forces of natural purification, as compared to water borne pathogensOther Indicators Include* Faecal streptococci: Faecal streptococci regularly occur in faeces, but in much smaller numbers than E. coll. Their presence is regarded as important confirmatory evidence of recent faecal pollution of water.* Cl. perfringens: They also occur regularly in faeces and their spores are capable of surviving in water for a longer time than organisms of the coliform group. So, the presence of spores in the absence of the coliform group, suggests that faecal contamination occurred at some remote time.",
