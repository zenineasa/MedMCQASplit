Main design features of septic tank are: - Capacity: Depends on number of users. A capacity of 20-30 gallons or 2 and half to 5 c. ft. / person is recommended for household septic tanks. Minimum capacity of a septic tank= at least 500 gallons. - Length is usually twice the breadth. - Depth = 1. 5 to 2 m (5-7 ft.). - Recommended liquid depth = 1. 2 m (4 ft.). - There should be a minimum air space of 30 cm (12 in.) b/w level of liquid in tank & undersurface of cover. - There are submerged inlet & outlet pipes. - In some septic tanks, bottom is sloping towards inlet end, facilitating retention of solids as sludge. - Septic tank is covered by a concrete slab of suitable thickness & provided with manhole. - These are designed in this country to allow a retention period of 24 hours. Too long retention period will result in undue septicity of effluent.

Ref: Park 23eJ P 720-21* Ideally, drinking water shouldn't contain any organism known to be pathogenic.* The primary bacterial indicator recommended as a bacteriological indicator is the coliform group of organisms as a whole. These include both fecal and non-fecal organisms.* Typical example of the fecal group is E. coli (single best indicator) and of the non-faecal group, Klebsiella aerogens. Reasons why foliform organisms are chosen as indicators of fecal pollution rater than the water borne pathogens directly* Constant presence of coliform organisms in great abundance in human intestine. These organisms are foreign to potable water. Therefore their presence is looked upon as evidence of fecal contamination.* They are easily detected by culture methods* Longer survival as compared to other water borne pathogens* They have greater resistance to the forces of natural purification, as compared to water borne pathogens. Other Indicators Include* Faecal streptococci: Faecal streptococci regularly occur in faeces, but in much smaller numbers than E. coll. Their presence is regarded as important confirmatory evidence of recent faecal pollution of water.* Cl. perfringens: They also occur regularly in faeces and their spores are capable of surviving in water for a longer time than organisms of the coliform group. So, the presence of spores in the absence of the coliform group, suggests that faecal contamination occurred at some remote time.",

Explanation: The residual chlorine that remains at the end of one hour contact period is called the 'free residual chlorine'. The purpose of residual chlorine is to provide margin of safety against contamination during storage and distribution. The minimum concentration of free residual chlorine for drinking purpose should be 0. 5 mg/ litre or 0. 5 parts per million. Free residual chlorine is detected by ortho toludine test using chloroscope / chlorotex apparatus. During a threat of outbreak of water borne epidemic we do super chlorination when the free residual chlorine is more than 2mg/litre. Such high levels may irritate throat, nose and eye.

ALSO KNOW: Most effective and cheapest method of chlorination of wells in rural India is by bleaching powder (chlorination). Bleaching powder contains 33 % of chlorine content, is unstable with rapid and brief action. PERCHLORON (High test hypochloride) is a calcium compound which contains 60-70 % available chlorine. Chlorine demand of well w. Tater is estimated by Horrock's Apparatus. Roughly 2. 5 gms of bleaching powder is required to disinfect 1000 lit of water. One tablet of chlorine (0. 5 gm) can disinfect 20 liters of water. Chlorine acts best as a disinfectant w. Then the pH of water is around 7 because of the predominance of hypochlorous acid. This wdll give an approximate dose of 0. 7 mg of applied chlorine per liter of water. A contact period of 1 hour is allowed before the w. Tater is drawn for use. At the end of 1 hour the residual chlorine is tested by \"ORTHOTOLIDINE ARSENITE TEST\" (modification of Orthotolidine test) Orthotolidine test = 0. 1 ml of reagent + 1 ml of water (read after 10 sec) Orthotolidine reagent = Orthotolidine + 10% solution of HCLIf free residual chlorine level is less than 0. 5mg/litre, the chlorination procedure should be repeated before any water is drawn.

        "exp": "1. OHOTOLUIDINE (OT) TEST Gives value of free and total (combined + free) chlorine levels. Combined chlorine can be easily calculated by subtracting free chlorine from total chlorine. Reagent: Ohotoluidine dissolved in 10% solution of hydrochloric acid. Yellow color produced on reacting with chlorine. Reading within 10 seconds of addition of chlorine --> Free chlorine. Reading after a lapse of 15-20 mins --> Total chlorine. 2. OHOTOLUIDINE-ARSENITE (OTA) TEST Modification of OT test. Gives value of free and combined chlorine separately. Not affected by presence of nitrates/iron/manganese (Thus, superior to OT test).",
