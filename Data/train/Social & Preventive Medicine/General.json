Its good sources are oat, flaxseeds, peas, beans, apple, citrus fruits, carrots, barley and psyllium. ii) Insoluble fibre: It promotes movement of material through digestive system and increases stool bulk. Its good sources are wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts and vegetables. Advantages of fibreso Dietry fibre contribute bulk by absorbing water 1-15 times of its own weight and thus hastens the passage through the gut, decreasing the transient time. o By increasing the bulk, it provides a larger volume of indigestible material to colon. o Dietary fibre is known to be associated with reduced incidence of coronary artery diseases. The mechanism of its action is attributed to its binding to bile salts and preventing its absorption and thus reducing cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) level in circulation. o The fibre, particularly the gum and pectin, when ingested with a diet, are reported to reduce post-prandial glucose level in blood - helpful in DM. o Dietary fibre reduce the incidence of diverticulitis, constipation, hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome and colon cancer.",
