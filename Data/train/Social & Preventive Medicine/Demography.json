Also know. Total fertility rate: Total fertility rate represents the average number of children a woman would have if she were to pass through her reproductive years bearing children at the same rates as the women now in each age group. This measure gives the approximate magnitude of \"completed family size \"Gross reproduction rate (GRR): Average number of girls that would be bom to a married woman if she experiences the current fertility pattern throughout her reproductive span (15-44 or 49 year) assuming no mortality Net reproductive rate (NRR): NRR is defined as the number of daughters a newborn girl will bear during her lifetime assuming fixed age specific fertility and mortality rates. NRR is demographic indicator, the present level of NRR in India is 1. 5 (1990). NRR of 1 is equivalent to attaining approximately the 2-child norm. The govt, of India in 1983 adopted the policy of attaining a NRR of 1 by the year 1996 (now to be achieved by 2006).

The Hardy-Weinberg \"equilibrium\" refers to this stability of allele frequencies over time.

Explanation: General fertility rate (GFR):* The number of births in a year divided by the number of women aged 15-44, times 1000. It focuses on the potential mothers only, and takes the age distribution into account. Gross reproduction rate (GRR). It is the average number of daughters that would be bom to a woman (or a group of women) if she survived at least to the age of 45 and conformed to the age-specific fertility rate of a given year. It is often regarded as the extent to which the generation of daughters replaces the preceding generation of females. This rate is similar to the net reproduction rate but it ignores the fact that some women will die before completing their childbearing years. The GRR is particularly relevant where sex ratios are significantly affected by the use of reproductive technologies. Total fertility rate (TFR). Also called as fertility rate, period total fertility rate (PTFR) or total period fertility rate (TPFR) It is the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if: She were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) through her lifetime. She were to survive from birth through the end of her reproductive life. It is obtained by summing the single-year age- specific rates at a given time. Net reproduction rate (NRR). It is defined as the number of daughters a woman would have in her lifetime if she were subject to prevailing age-specific fertility and mortality rates in the given year. When the NRR is exactly one, then each generation of women is exactly reproducing itself. NRR is particularly relevant where the number of male babies born is very high. This is a significant factor in world population, due to the high level of gender imbalance in the very populous nations of China and India. The gross reproduction rate (GRR), is the same as the NRR, except that--like the TFR--it ignores life expectancy. Latest Indian Data (Census 2011). Crude birth rate24. 8. General Fertility rate95. 3.

Birth rate - Number of live births during the year per 1000 estimated mid-year population. General fertility rate (GFR) - Number of live births in an area during the year per 1000 midyear female population age 15-44 (or49) in the same year. Age specific fertility rate (ASFR)- Number of live births in a particular age group per 1000 midyear female population of the same age group. Total fertility rate - Average number of children a women would have if she were to pass through her reproductive years hearing children at the same rates as the women now in each age group. Gross reproductive rate - Average number of girl children a women would have if she were to pass through her reproductive years bearing children at the same rates as the women now in each age group* Net reproductive rate - Average number of daughters a newborn girl will bear during her lifetime assuming fixed age-specific fertility and mortality rates. Also Note. NRR = number of daughters a new born girl will bear during her lifetime assuming fixed age- specific fertility and mortatlity rates. TFR = 2. 1 is equivalent to two child norm. NRR = 1 is equivalent to two child norm, as in NRR we only take into account only female children. NRR = 1 means each women is replaced hut a women (her female child). If NRR is less than l. then reproductive performance of the population is said to be below' replacement level. NRR=1 can be achived only atleast 60% of eligible couples are effectively practising family planning. That is Couple Protection Rate of 60%",

Rule of 70: An old rule of thumb, called the rule of 70, is helpful in understanding growth rates and the effects of compounding. According to the rule of 70, if some variable grows at a rate of x% per year, then that variable doubles in approximately70/x years. Doubling time = 70/Growth rate.

Germany, Hungary, Russia. Park has wrongly placed china and Singapore in late expanding. They are now low stationary (updates from Wikipedia). Theoretically, when the TFR = 2, each pair of parents just replaces itself. Actually it takes a TFR of 2. 1 or 2. 2 to replace each generation -- this number is called the replacement rate -- because some children will die before they grow up to have their own two children.",
