These are called defence mechanisms. Psychologists have identified a number of such defence mechanisms, which include the following 1. Rationalization: Instead of accepting failure and correcting himself, the individual tries to make excuses and justifies his behaviour. It is like the proverbial fox declaring that the grapes were sour, when it could not reach them. This is called rationalization. It is a face-saving device. 2. Projection: Sometimes the individual blames others for his mistakes or failures. It is just like the student saying that he could not score good marks in the examination because, his teacher did. not like him. 3. Compensation: Many people make use of compensation to enhance their self-esteem and prestige. The familiar example is that the student who is not good in his studies may distinguish himself in spos or dramatics, music or other activities. 4. Escape mechanism: Some individuals adopt what is known as an \"escape mechanism\" to overcome failure or defeat. Some students pretend illness and do not appear for examinations. This is an escape phenomenon. Then there are others who take to alcohol or drugs trying to solve their problems. This is also an escape phenomenon. 5. Displacement: An office clerk badly snubbed by his superior takes it out on his wife and children on reaching home. This is like a rebound phenomenon. It is trying to escape from one situation and fixing blame on another situation. 6. Regression: Some people reso to childhood practices (e. g., weeping when something goes wrong} as a mode of adjustment.",
