Simplicity; safety, rapidity; ease of administration and cost are other considerations. Acceptability: Test should be acceptable to the people or whom it is aimed. In general, tests that are painful. discomforting or embarrassing (e. g.. rectal or vaginal examinations) are not likely to be acceptable to the population in mass campaigns. Repeatability: The test must give consistent results when repeated more than once on the same individual or material, under the same conditions. Validity (accuracy): The term validity refers to what extent the test accurately measures which it purports to measure. In other words, validity expresses the ability of a test to separate or distinguish those w! ho have the disease from those who do not. It has two components: Sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity: It has been defined as the ability of a test to identify correctly all those who have the disease that is \"true positive\". Specificity: It is defined as the ability of a test to identify correctly those who do not have the disease, that is, \"true negatives\".
