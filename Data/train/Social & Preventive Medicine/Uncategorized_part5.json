        "question": "Type of sampling, if random sample is taken from a characteristic population, eg. Hindus, Muslims, Christians etc?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Stratified random Stratified random sampling is paicularly useful where one is interested in analysing the data by a ceain characteristic of the population, viz Hindus, Muslims, Christians, age group etc, - as we know these groups are not equally distributed in the population. \"............... Park Simple random sampling Simple random sampling, also, known as 'unrestricted random sampling'; is applicable for small, homogenous, readily available population and is used in clinical trials. In simple random sampling each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance. So, each individual has the same probability of being chosen at any stage during the sampling process. For example:? Let us assume you had a school with 1000 students, divided equally into boys and girls, and you wanted to select 100 of them for fuher study. You might put all their names in a bucket and then pull 100 names out. Not only does each person have an equal chance of being selected, we can also easily calculate the probaility of a given person being chosen, since we know the sample size (n) and population (N) and it becomes a simple matter of division - n/N or 100/1000 = 0. 10 (10%). This means that every student in the school has a 10% or 1 in 10 chance of being selected using this method. Systematic random sampling In order to do systematic random sampling, the individuals in a population are arranged in a ceain way (for example, alphabetically). A random staing point is selected and then every nth (for example 10th or 15th) individual is selected for the sample. That is, after arranging the individuals in ceain pattern (e. g., alpabetically) a staing point is chosen at random, and choices thereafter at regular intervals. For example, suppose you want to sample 8 houses from a street of 120 houses. 120/8 = 15, So every 15th house is chosen after a random staing point between 1 and 15. If the random staing point is 11, then the houses selected are- 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 101, and 116. In contrast to simple random sampling, some houses have a larger selection probabily e. g., in this question 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 100 and 116. While the remaining number can not be selected. Stratified random sampling When sub-populations vary considerably, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently. Stratification is the process of grouping members of the population into relative hemogenous subgroups before sampling. The strata should be mutually exclusive, every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. Then systematic random sampling method is applied within each stratum. Population - Stratification - Systematic random sampling - Sample. This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error. For example, suppose in a population of 1000, sample of 100 is to be drawn for Hb estimation, first conve the population into homogenous striata (e. g., 700 males and 300 females), then draw 70 males and 30 females by doing systematic random sampling.",

Secular is influenced by population features e. g. - Change of degree of susceptibility e. g. by immunization - Socioeconomic - Environmental sanitation and - Nutritional status of a population. 2. Periodic (cyclic variation) Where disease occurrence for a period then increase again in cyclic pattern e. g. measles in prevaccination era occur every 2 - 3 years. 3. Seasonality By graphing the occurrence of a disease by week or month over the course of a year or more we can show its seasonal pattern.

Transmission by a vector may be of following types:? A. Mechanical transmission The infectious agent is mechanically transpoed by vector, e. g., through souling of feet of flying ahropod. There is no development or multiplication of infectious agent within the vector. B. Biological transmission The infectious agent undergoes replication (change in number) or development (change in form) or both in vector. So, inectious agent requires an incubation period (extrinsic incubation period) before vector can transmit it to host. This type of transmission is of three types: - i) Propagative Agent undergoes multiplication (change in number) in the vector. There is no development - No change in form. Example - Plague bacilli in rate fleas. ii) Cyclo-developmental Agent undergoes only development - Change in form. No multiplication - No change in number. Example - Micorfilaria in mosquito. iii) Cyclo-propagative Agent undergoes both development and multiplication - Change in form and number. Example - Malaria parasite (plasmodium sp.) in mosquito.",

These viruses are only distantly related to the human parainfluenza viruses, which are RNA viruses belonging to the paramyxovirus family that are a common cause of respiratory infections in children such as croup. Sore throat, fever and coughs are the most frequent symptoms. In more serious cases, influenza causes pneumonia, which can be fatal, paicularly for the young and the elderly. Typically, influenza is transmitted through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating aerosols containing the virus. Influenza can also be transmitted by direct contact with bird droppings or nasal secretions, or through contact with contaminated surfaces. Influenza viruses can be inactivated by sunlight, disinfectants and detergents. As the virus can be inactivated by soap, frequent hand washing reduces the risk of infection. Influenza pandemics show cyclical trend and are known to occur at intervals of 740 years, due to antigenic variations.",

The World Health Organization defines perinatal moality as the \"number of stillbihs and deaths in the first week of life per 1, 000 live bihs\", but other definitions have been used Fetal moality refers to stillbihs or fetal death. It encompasses any death of a fetus after 20 weeks of gestation or 500 gm. In some definitions of the PNM early fetal moality (week 20-27 gestation) is not included, and the PNM may only include late fetal death and neonatal death. Fetal death can also be divided into death prior to labor, antenatal (antepaum) death, and death during labor, intranatal (intrapaum) death Early neonatal moality refers to a death of a live-born baby within the first seven days of life, while late neonatal moality covers the time after 7 days until before 28 days. The sum of these two represents the neonatal moality. Some definitions of the PNM include only the early neonatal moality. Neonatal moality is affected by the quality of in-hospital care for the neonate. Neonatal moality and postneonatal moality (covering the remaining 11 months of the first year of life) are reflected in the Infant Moality Rate. The PNMR refers to the number of perinatal deaths per 1, 000 total bihs. It is usually repoed on an annual basis. It is a major marker to assess the quality of health care delivery.",

Cigarette consumption is inversely propoional to life expectancy o If there is a perfect linear relationship between the two variables so that it is possible to know the exact value of one variable from the knowledge of other variable, the correlation coefficient ( r) will be exactly + or - 1. 00 ( +1 or -1 ). o If there is absolutely no relationship between the two variables so that it is impossible to know anything about one variable on the basis of knowledge of the other variable. Then the coefficient will be 0. Strength of correlation o The strength of linear relationship between two random variables X and Y is based on the value of correlation coefficient and is often summarized according to the following guidelines:- For Positive Correlation For negative correlation Interpretation r<0. 30 - 0. 30 r very weak linear relationship 0. 30 5 r < 0. 50 - 0. 50 < r 5 - 0. 30 weak linear relationship 0. 50 _. r < or 0. 80 - 0. 80 <r - 0. 50 moderate linear relationship 0. 80 5.. r< 0. 90 - 0. 90 <r- 0. 80 strong linear relationship r 0. 90 1. 5.-0. 90 very strong linear relationship o If you have difficulty in interpreting above table, I am giving in very simple language:- A.

PE is method to analyze the involved tasks in completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete each task, and identifying the minimum time needed to complete the total project. The essence of PE is to construct an arrow diagram, which represents the logical sequence in which events must take place. It is possible with such a diagram to calculate the time by which each activity must be completed, and to identify those activities that are critical. Critical path method (CPM) The longest path of the network is called the critical path. Critical path method determines the activities of a project which are critical and are given longest path. Other activities are total float, i. e. they can be delayed without making the project longer. Any delay in activity on the critical path results in delay of the project. o In the above figure, the longest path is from equipment ordered to equipment installed.

        "exp": "Dropouts are excluded from the study [Ref: Epidemiology and health services By Haroutune K. Annenian, Sum Shapiro p63; http://www3. interscience. wiley. corn/ journa1/8901 1300/abstract? CRETRY =1 &SRETRY =0 Park 20/e p1 Repeat from Nov 08 Randomised controlled trials (RCT), are experimental studies where the effect of an intervention is assessed by collecting data before and after an intervention has taken place. RCT are used to compare an intervention with one or more other interventions or with no intervention. In RCT, an intervention is investigated by comparing one group of people who receive the intervention with a control group or control arm who do not. The control group receives the usual or no treatment and their outcome measure, or the change in measure from the staing point or baseline, is compared with that of the intervention group. RCT are designed to minimize bias: Subject variation or Performance bias: there may be bias on the pa of the paicipants, who may subjectively feel better or repo improvement if they may subjectively feel better or repo improvement if they knew they were receiving a new form of treatment. Observer bias: the investigator measuring the outcome of a therapeutic trial may be influenced if he knows beforehand the paicular procedure of therapy to which the patient has been subjected. Bias in evaluation: the investigator may subconsciously give a orable repo of the outcome of the trial, if he has beforehand knowledge of the group getting treatment. \"Randomization cannot guard against these sos of bias, nor the size of the sample. In order to reduce these problems, 'blinding' is adopted. \"- Park Blinding can be done in three ways: Single blinding- here the paicipants are not aware whether they belong to the study group or the control group. b. Double blinding- here neither the doctor nor the paicipant are aware of the group allocation and the treatment received. Triple blinding- here the paicipants, the investigator or person analyzing the data are all \"blind\". Ideally triple blinding should be used, but double blinding is the most common method used. Allocation bias Allocation bias occurs when the measured treatment effect differs from the true treatment effect because of how paicipants were selected into the intervention or control groups. In RCT, once the paicipants are entered into the study, they are randomised to either an intervention group or the control group. Randomisation ensures that characteristics that might affect the relationship between intervention and outcome measures will be roughly equal across all arms of the study, minimising potential bias. Random allocation of patients is preferable to other methods of allocation because only randomization has the ability to create truly comparable groups. All factors related to prognosis, whether or not they are known before the study takes place or have been measured, tend to be equally distributed in the comparison groups. Patients in one group are, on the average, as likely to possess a given characteristic as patients in another. In the long run, with a large number of patients in the trial, randomization usually works as described above. However, random allocation does not guarantee that the groups will be similar. Dissimilarities between groups can arise by chance alone, paicularly when the number of patients randomized is small. To assess whether this kind of 'bad luck' has occurred, authors of randomized controlled trials often present a table comparing the frequency of a variety of characteristics in the treated and control groups, especially those known to be related to outcome. These are called baseline characteristics because they are present before randomization and so should be equally distributed in the treatment groups. Attrition bias Attrition bias (also call loss-to-follow-up bias) occurs when patients drop out of the study from one or other of the study groups preferentially. For example, if halfway through a study the treatment has been successful paicipants may drop out, and information about the success of the treatment is then lost. Conversely, paicipants in the control group may be unhappy with their lack of progress and may drop out of the study in order to seek alternative help. Sample size The size of the sample required when carrying out RCT is dependent upon the power of the test and what size of intervention impact is considered meaningful. It also depends on the type of hypothesis the RCT is testing. The smaller the magnitude of difference between groups that is to be detected and the greater the variability in outcomes, the larger the sample size that will be required. Randomised controlled trials are the most rigorous way of determining whether a cause-effect relation exists between treatment and outcome, however they are generally more costly and time consuming than other studies. Now lets come to the last option that's our answer- \"Dropouts are excluded from the study. \" Though it sounds absurd but the truth is that the Dropouts are not excluded from the study. This is known as Intention to treat. The dropouts are included in the study. The aphorism is \"Once randomized, always analyzed\" Intention to treat (ITT) analysis (sometimes also called Intent to Treat) is an analysis based on the initial treatment intent, not on the treatment eventually administered. For example, if people who have a more refractory or serious problem tend to drop out at a higher rate, even a completely ineffective treatment may appear to be providing benefits if one merely compares those who finish the treatment with those who were enrolled in it. For the purposes of ITT analysis, everyone who begins the treatment is considered to be pa of the trial, whether they finish it or not. Rationale: Intention to treat analyses are done to avoid the effects of crossover and drop-out, which may break the randomization to the treatment groups in a study. Intention to treat analysis provides information about the potential effects of treatment policy rather than on the potential effects of specific treatment. If dropouts and noonadherent subjects are ignored, there is the possibility that bias will be introduced. For example consider two weight loss diets. one of which is effective while the other isn't. People on the effective diet lose weight and stay in the study. On the ineffective diet - Some will lose weight regardless and will stay in the study. - Those who fail to lose weight are more likely to drop out, if only to try something else. This will make the ineffective diet look better than it really is--and, by comparison, the effective diet looks worse than it really is--because the only subjects who remain in the study following the ineffective diet are those losing weight! A popular phrase used to describe ITT analyses is 'Analyze as randomized! \" Once subjects are randomized, their data must be used for the ITT analysis!",

Spurious association o Observed association between a disease and suspected factor is spurious, i. e., not real. o In other words there is an observed association when none actually exists. Indirect association o The indirect association is a statistical association between a variable of interest and a disease due to the presence of another factor, known or unknown, that is common to both the variable and the disease. o This third factor (i. e., the common factor) is also known as the confounding variable. o For example, endemic goitre (disease) is found at high altitudes (variable), showing thereby an association between altitude and endemic goitre. But it is due to iodine deficiency which is common at high altitude. So, iodine deficiency acts as a confounding factor as it is associated with both high altitude and endemic goitre.

International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of WHO, acknowledged dioxins cancer causing potential and classified it as human carcinogen. o To avoid dioxin production, no chlorinated plastic bags (and preferably no other chlorinated corn pounds) should be introduced into the incinerator.

If mercury-containing items are put into a red bag for infectious waste and sent to an incinerator or other waste treatment technology, mercury will contaminate the environment. o Airborne mercury then enters a global distribution cycle in the environment, contaminating fish and wildlife. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cross the blood- brain barrier as well as the placenta. Public concerns about incinerator emissions, as well as the creation of federal regulations for medical waste incinerators, are causing many health care facilities to rethink their choices in medical waste treatment. As stated by Health Care Without Harm, an international coalition of47() organizations in 52 countries, non-incineration treatment technologies are a growing and developing field. Some technologies are still essentially prototypes, while others, such as autoclave technology, have been used for decades.",

Transavarian transmission of the virus in mosquitoes has been shown to occur in adverse conditions (e. g., during extended dry seasons), in the absence of susceptible hosts. o There is no evidence that yellow fever has ever been present in Asia. Environmental factor for yellow fever. A temprature of 24degC or more is required for the multiplication of the virus in the mosquito. It should be accompnied by a relative humidity of over 60% for the mosquitoes to live long. Urbanization is leading to extension of yellow fever in Africa. Measures designed to restrict the spread of yellow fever are specified in the \"International health regulation\" of WHO. These are implemented by the Govt of India through stringent aerial and maritime traffic regulations. Broadly these comprise: - i. Travellers All travellers (including infants) exposed to yellow fever or passing through endemic zones of yellow fever must posses a valid international ceificate fo vaccination against yellow fever before they are allowed to enter yellow fever receptive areas like India. The validity of the ceificate begins 10 days after the date of vaccination and extends up to 10 years. Revaccination performed before the end of the validity of ceicicate renders the ceificate valid for a fuher period of 10 years staing on the day of revaccination. If no such ceificate fo vaccination is available, the travellar is placed on quarantine for 6 days from the date of leaving an infected area. ii. Mosquitoes The aircraft and ships arriving from endemic areas are subjected to aerosol spraying with prescribed insecticides. Airpos and Seapos are kept free from the breeding of insect vectors over an area extending at least 400 metres around their perimeters. The \"aedes aegypti index\" is kept below 1.",

In India, epidemic dropsy occurs as a food adulterant disease where use of mustard oil as cooking medium is common. When mustard oil is adulterated deliberately (as in most cases) or accidental contamination with argemone oil, proteinuria (specifically loss of albumin) occurs, with a resultant edema as would occur in nephrotic syndrome. Other symptoms are bilaterall pitting edema of extremities headache, nausea, loose bowels, erythema and breathlessness. In severe cases fatalities are repoed due to congestive heart failure. The toxic effects of argemone oil have been attributed to the presence of benzophenanthridine alkaloids, sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine. it has been repoed that the sanguinarine alkaloid content in argemone oil varies from 0. 44% to 0. 50%. Sanguinarine and Dihydrosanguinarine alkaloids, present in argemone oil are the responsible etiological agents of Epidemic dropsy. Though, epidemic dropsy is known in the country for the past hundred years still there are no established effective lines of treatment.",

        "exp": "Phase 2 blockade produced succinylcholine [Ref: Morgan's Anaesthesia 4/e p 112; Miller's Anaesthesia 6/e p 9851 Patients developing paralysis after prolonged and high dose of succinyl choline is highly suggestive of phase II succinyl choline block. Phase II block with succinylcholine occurs with prolonged and high dose of the drug. -(High dose for Sch is 7-10 mg/kg, 30-60 minutes of exposure is considered prolong). Morgan's Anaesthesia 4thie p. 112 The type of succinylcholine block may change into a non depolarizing block following prolonged administration of the drug (phase II block). Transition from a depolarizing to phase 11 block is gradual and usually occurs after administration of 7-10 mg/kg of succinylcholine. Recovery from a phase II block is much slower. Millers Anaesthesia 6thie p. 985 After administration of 7-10 mg/kg or 30-60 minutes of exposure to succinylcholine, nondepolarizing dual or phase II block occurs Prolonged paralysis with succinylcholine administration may also occur in pseudocholinesterase deficiency - But in pseudocholinesterase deficiency prolonged paralysis occurs with usual dose of succinylcholine. Succinylcholine is a noncompetitive muscle relaxant Normally muscles contract due to the action of acetylcholine released in the neuromuscular synaptic junctions Acetylcholine acts by activating its receptors present on motor end plate, and generates action potential Competitive Neuromuscular blockers act by blocking the action of acetylcholine and prevents the generation of action potential. On the other hand succinylcholine acts by depolarization of the motor end plate i. e. it activates the acetylcholine receptor present at the motor end plate. - At their,, first application voluntary muscle contracts but as they are not destroyed immediately like acetylcholine the depolarization persist. It might be expected that this prolonged depolarisation would cause muscles to remain contracted but this is not so. - With prolonged administration, a depolarization block changes to competitive block. Succinykholine produces neuromuscular block by overstimulation so that the end plate is unable to respond to fuher stimulation. Neuromuscular block with succinykholine occurs in two sequential phases An initial depolarization of the endplate produces muscle action potentials and. fasciculations. Maintained depolarization past the threshold for. firing produces Na+ channel inactivation so that muscle action potentials cannot be generated. This is called phase I or depolarization block In the continued presence of succinylcholine, the membrane becomes repolarized. Na+ channel inactivation is reversed and muscle membrane excitability is restored Nonetheless, the neuromuscular block persists because of desensitization of Acetylcholine receptors This is known as phase II or desensitization block -The mechanism for phase 11 block is not completely understood, a series of allosteric transitions in Acetylcholine receptor is suspected. Succinylcholine phase I block changes to phase II block after prolonged administration of the drug usually following 7-10 mg/kg of the drug or 700 nzg drug. Pseudocholinesterase deficiency Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine which is pharmacologically inactive. In ceain conditions metabolism of succinylcholine to the metabolically inactive succinylmonocholine cannot occur. These are:? Genetic determined inability to metabolize succinylcholine -Small propoion of patients have genetically determined inability to metabolize succinylcholine. -1n these patients either the plasma cholinesterase is absent or there is an abnormal fornz of the enzyme present. - The metabolism of sucinylcholine is reduced and the patient have prolonged paralysis. - An impoant point to note is that this prolonged paralysis occurs even with usual doses of succinylcholine. Other endogenous and exogenous causes Plasma cholinesterase activity can be reduced by a number of endogenous and exogenous causes such as: -- Pregnancy - Liver disease - Uremia - Malnutrition - Burns - Plasma pheresis - Oral contraceptives These conditions usually lead to a slight clinically unimpoant increase in the duration of action of succinylcholine.",

So, when disease occurs in expected frequency in the absence of epidemic --> Endemic disease. o When conditions are ourable for disease agent, it may occur in excess of expected occurrence, i. e., endemic disease bursts into epidemic. o If normal expectancy is zero, even one case is considered epidemics. That means occurence of new disease in a community is an epidemic. Similarly reoccurrence of an eradicated/eliminated disease is an epidemic. Statistically speaking, epidemic is said to occur when number of cases exceed 'twice the standard detion' Some times term outbreak is used. for a small, usually localized epidemic. o Diseases causing epidemics are measles, chickenpox, and cholera. o Besides these there is modern slow epidemic of non-communicable diseases like CHD. Pandemic o An epidemic usually affecting a large propoion of population over a large geographic area such as a nation, e. g., influenza, Cholera El Tor and acute hemorrhagic conjuctivitis. Ecdemic o Disease that originates outside the geographic area in which it occurs. Sporadic o The cases occur irregularly, haphazardly from time to time, and generally infrequently. o The cases are so few and separated widely in space and time that they show little or no connection with each other, nor a recognizable common source of infection. o Examples - Polio, Tetanus, meningococcal meningitis, Herpes Zoster.

Now a days Kuppuswamy's scale is widely used to measure the socio-economic status of an individual in urban community based on three variables namely education, occupation and income. The modification of Kuppuswamy scale is meant to determine the socioeconomic status of family based on education and occupation of head of the family and per capita income per month has also been widely used. Recently, Mishra et al have suggested an economic revision of Kuppuswami's scale in order to account for the devaluation of rupee. In the rural areas, Pareekh classification based on nine characteristics namely caste, occupation of family head, education of family head, level of social paicipation of family head, landholding, housing, farm power, material possessions and type of family.

This shows that money is not everything. PQLI might be regarded as an improvement but shares the general problems of measuring quality of life in a quantitative way.

It was first developed by Maurice Hilleman in the late 1960s The vaccine is a mixture of three live attenuated viruses. The MMR vaccine is administered by a subcutaneous injection. In the case of live vaccines, immunization is generally achieved with a single dose. The exception is polio vaccine which needs three or more doses. As per Indian Academy of Paediatrics, the vaccine is administered once to children around the age of 15 months. Few countries advocates a second dose also before staing of school (i. e. age 4/5). The second dose is not a booster; it is a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2-5%) who fail to develop measles immunity after the first dose. An inactivated vaccine (or killed vaccine) consists of virus paicles which are grown in culture and then killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde Types include: - Viral: polio vaccine (Salk vaccine) and influenza vaccine - Bacterial: typhoid vaccine, cholera vaccine, plague vaccine, and peussis vaccine Examples of live attenuated vaccines include: - Viral: polio vaccine (Sabin vaccine), measles vaccine, mumps vaccine, rubella vaccine, chicken pox vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, and nasal-spray flu vaccine. - Bacterial: BCG vaccine, typhoid vaccine A toxoid is a bacterial toxin (usually an exotoxin) whose toxicity has been weakened or suppressed either by chemical (formalin) or heat treatment, while other propeies, typically immunogenicity, are maintained. Toxoids are used in vaccines as they induce an immune response to the original toxin or increase the response to another antigen. For example, the tetanus toxoid (derived from the tetanospasmin produced by Clostridium tetani and causing tetanus) and diphtheria toxoid.",

        "question": "A person found some correlation between dietary factors and a disease; he did this by collecting data from the food manufacturers and hospitals respectively, such a study is?",
        "exp": "Ecological study. Observational studies allow nature to take its own course; the investigator measures but does not intervene. Descriptive studies are those that investigate the distribution of disease in a population Analytical studies analyse the relationship between the disease and the causative factors. Experimental or interventional studies involve an active attempt to change a disease determinant or the progress of a disease (similar in design to experiments in other sciences) Descriptive studies Descriptive studies are usually the first phase of an epidemiological investigation. These studies are concerned with observing the distribution of disease or health-related characteristics in human population and identify the characteristics with which the disease in question seems to be associated. These studies provide clues to disease etiology and help in formulation of an etiological hypothesis. Case repo - the simplest of the descriptive studies is the case repo, which is often seen in medical journals and describes an unusual feature or unusual association between the disease and some exposure factor. Case series - a case series is a sequence of case repos with common elements such as similar clinical features and suspected common exposures. They can be valuable early evidence for association between exposures and diseases which can be studied in more detail subsequently; however as they lack a control (comparison) group, the case series can result in false leads, wasted energy & resources. Cross-sectional or Prevalence study - in cross-sectional studies, we 'survey' several individuals at one point in time and collect information on health status, health-related behaviours, and other exposure factors. In this way we can estimate the burden of disease in a group of individuals and try to estimate whether a paicular exposure is linked to a disease or health outcome. Ecological or correlational study - an ecological or correlational study is one in which the unit of analysis is an aggregate of individuals and information is collected on this group rather than on individual members. The association between a summary measure of disease and a summary measure of exposure is studied. E. g., There is a positive correlation between fat consumption and breast cancer across many nations. Conclusion: Fat consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer. An error of reasoning (Ecological Fallacy) occurs when conclusions are drawn about individuals from data that are associated with groups, as relationships observed for groups may not necessarily hold for individuals. In the above example, it is not possible to infer that the women with breast cancer actually had a high fat consumption. Analytical studies Analytical studies are the second major type of epidemiological studies. In contrast to descriptive studies that look at the entire population, in analytical studies the subject of interest is the individual within the population. The object is not to formulate, but to test hypotheses. Case Control - Sometimes it is necessary to study individuals in whom a disease has already occurred in order to find out whether these individuals had been exposed to a paicular risk factor. This is called a case control study. The cases are compared to a group of individuals who do not have the disease in question and the same information on risk factors is collected from both groups. By doing this, we may be able to find out if a paicular risk factor is more common among the cases than controls and therefore suggest an association between the risk factor and disease. Coho study - In a coho study, a group exposed to a paicular factor and another group not exposed to this factor are followed up over time to determine occurrence of disease. The incidence of disease in the exposed group is compared to the incidence of disease in the unexposed group. This is called the relative risk and it allows us to make a judgment on whether the exposure factor and the disease are causally linked.",

D: Attributable risk can be Case-control is a type of epidemiological study design in which individuals with a defined characteristic (often, a specific diagnosis, perhaps lung cancer) are matched with people who do not have the condition but are otherwise similar (the 'controls'). Fuher data is then collected on those individuals and the groups are compared to find out if other characteristics (perhaps a history of smoking) are also different between the two groups. They have pointed the way to a number of impoant discoveries and advances, but their retrospective, non-randomized nature limits the strength of their conclusions. However, coho studies and randomized controlled trials, which provide stronger evidence, usually take much more time and money. Case-control studies are a relatively inexpensive and frequently-used type of epidemiological study that can be carried out by small teams or individual researchers in single facilities over a relatively sho period of time. Ethical approval is more easily obtained for an observational rather than an experimental study. One of the most significant triumphs of the case-control study was the demonstration of the link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. Case control generally yields only estimate of odd's ratio, whereas coho's study yields incidence rates, relative risk as well as attributable risk.",

        "exp": "Standard deviation measures the variation (dispersion) of an individual data from the mean. SD tells how tightly all the values are clustered around the mean in a set of data. High standard deviation indicates that the data is dispersed away from the mean. Low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to mean, i. e. data points are clustered close to the mean. For example, the average height for adult men in USA is about 70 inches, and standard deviation is 3 inches. Then - If dispersion of mean is 1 SD -> most men (about 68%) have a height within 3 inches of the mean (67-73) inches. If dispersion of mean is 2 SD -> almost all men (95%) have a height within 6 inches of the mean (64 - 76) inches. If dispersion is zero SD all men would be exactly 70 inches. That means greater the standard deviation greater will be the data spread away from standard deviation. Coming back to question Here all newborn babies has 2. 8 kgs of weight. That means there is no dispersion from mean. So, standard deviation is zero.",

Meta-analysis is a statistical technique for amalgamating, summarising, and reviewing previous quantitative research. By using meta-analysis, a wide variety of questions can be investigated, as long as a reasonable body of primary research studies exist. Selected pas of the repoed results of primary studies are entered into a database, and this \"meta-data\" is \"meta-analyzed\", in similar ways to working with other data - descriptively and then inferentially to test ceain hypotheses. The appeal of meta analysis is that it in effect combines all the research on one topic into one large study with many paicipants. The danger is that in amalgamating a large set of different studies the construct definitions can become imprecise and the results difficult to interpret meaningfully. In a meta-analysis, research studies are collected, coded, and interpreted using statistical methods similar to those used in primary data analysis. The result is an integrated review of findings that is more objective and exact than a narrative review. By accumulating results across studies, one can gain a more accurate representation of the population relationship than is provided by the individual study estimators.",

        "question": "Minimum duration of developing coal miner pneumoconiosis: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. D: More than 10 years Simple pneumoconiosis (first phase of anthracosis) requires 12 years of exposure Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP)/ Black lung disease It is caused by long exposure to coal dust. It is a common affliction of coal miners and others who work with coal, similar to both silicosis from inhaling silica dust, and to the long-term effects of tobacco smoking. Inhaled coal dust progressively builds up in the lungs and is unable to be removed by the body; that leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and in worse cases, necrosis. Coal workers' pneumoconiosis, severe state, develops after the initial, milder form of the disease known as anthracosis (anthrac - coal, carbon). This is often asymptomatic and is found to at least some extent in all urban dwellers due to air pollution. Prolonged exposure to large amounts of coal dust can result in more serious forms of the disease, simple coal workers' pneumoconiosis and complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis (or Progressive massive fibrosis, or PMF). More commonly, workers exposed to coal dust develop industrial bronchitis, clinically defined as chronic bronchitis (i. e. productive cough for 3 months per year for at least 2 years) associated with workplace dust exposure. Coal dust is not as fibrogenic as is silica dust. Coal dust that enters the lungs can neither be destroyed nor removed by the body. The paicles are engulfed by resident alveolar or interstitial macrophages and remain in the lungs, residing in the connective tissue or pulmonary lymph nodes. Coal dust provides a sufficient stimulus for the macrophage to release various products, including enzymes, cytokines, oxygen radicals, and fibroblast growth factors, which are impoant in the inflammation and fibrosis of CWP. Aggregations of carbon-laden macrophages can be visualised under a microscope as granular, black areas. In serious cases, the lung may grossly appear black. These aggregations can cause inflammation and fibrosis, as well as the formation of nodular lesions within the lungs. Simple CWP is marked by the presence of 1-2mm nodular aggregations of anthracotic macrophages, suppoed by a fine collagen network, within the lungs. Those 1-2mm in diameter are known as coal macules, with larger aggregations known as coal nodules. These structures occur most frequently around the initial site of coal dust accumulation - the upper regions of the lungs around respiratory bronchioles. The coal macule is the basic pathological feature of CWP, and has a surrounding area of enlargement of the airspace, known as focal emphysema. Continued exposure to coal dust following the development of simple CWP may progress to complicated CWP with progressive massive fibrosis (PMF), wherein large masses of dense fibrosis develop, usually in the upper lung zones, measuring greater than 1 cm in diameter, with accompanying decreased lung function. These cases generally require a number of years to develop. Grossly, the lung itself appears blackened. Pathologically, these consist of fibrosis with haphazardly-arranged collagen and many pigment-laden macrophages and abundant free pigment. Radiographically, CWP can appear strikingly similar to silicosis. In simple CWP, small rounded nodules predominate, tending to first appear in the upper lung zones. The nodules may coalesce and form large opacities (>1 cm), characterizing complicated CWP, or PMF There are three basic criteria for the diagnosis of CWP: - Chest radiography consistent with CWP - An exposure history to coal dust (typically underground coal mining) of sufficient amount and latency - Exclusion of alternative diagnoses (mimics of CWP) Symptoms and pulmonary function testing relate to the degree of respiratory impairment, but are not pa of the diagnostic criteria. Chest X-ray appearance for CWP can be viually indistinguishable from silicosis. Chest CT, paicularly high-resolution scanning (HRCT), are more sensitive than plain X-ray for detecting the small round opacities.",

A: Treatment is done by doctor Principles of primary health care are equitable distribution, community paicipation, intersectoral coordination and appropriate technology Primary health care The Alma Ata Conference defines Primary Health Care as essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally, accessible to individuals and families in the community by means of acceptable to them, through their full paicipation and at a cost that community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination. It forms an integral pa of both the country's health system, of which it is the central function and the main focus and of the overall social and economic development of the community Goal The global goal as stated in the Alma Ata Declaration is Health for All by the year 2000 through self-reliance. - Health begins at home, in schools and in the workplace because it is there where people live and work that health is made or broken. - It also means that people will use better approaches than they do now for preventing diseases and alleting unavoidable disease and disability and have better ways of growing up, growing old and dying gracefully. - It also means that here will be even distribution among the population of whatever resources for health are available. - It means that essential health services will be accessible to all individuals and families in an acceptable and affordable way. Principles and Strategies: Accessibility, Availability, Affordability and Acceptability of Health Services Strategies: - Health services delivered where the people are - Use of indigenous/resident volunteer health worker as a health care provider with a ratio of one community health worker per 10-20 households - Use of traditional (herbal medicine) with essential drugs. Provision of quality, basic and essential health services Strategies: - Training design and curriculum based on community needs and priorities. - Attitudes, knowledge and skills developed are on promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative health care. - Regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of community health workers performance by the community and health staff. Community Paicipation Strategies: - Awareness, building and consciousness raising on health and health-related issues. - Planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation done through small group meetings (10-20 households cluster) Selection of community health workers by the community. - Formation of health committees. Establishment of a community health organization at the parish or municipal level. - Mass health campaigns and mobilization to combat health problems. Self-reliance Strategies Community generates suppo (cash, labor) for health programs. - Use of local resources (human, financial, material) - Training of community in leadership and management skills. - Incorporation of income generating projects, cooperatives and small scale industries. Recognition of interrelationship of health and development Strategies: - Convergence of health, food, nutrition, water, sanitation and population services. Integration of PHC into national, regional, provincial, municipal and barangay development plans. - Coordination of activities with economic planning, education, agriculture, industry, housing, public works, communication and social services. Establishment of an effective health referral system. Social Mobilization Strategies - Establishment of an effective health referral system. - Multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary linkage. - Information, education, communication suppo using multi-media. - Collaboration between government and non-governmental organizations. Decentralization Strategies - Reallocation of budgetary resources. - Reorientation of health professional and PHC. Advocacy for political and suppo from the national leadership down to the barangay level. 8 Essential Health Services in Primary Health Care - E - Education for Health - L - Locally endemic disease control - C - Expanded program for immunization M - Maternal and Child Health including responsible parenthood - E - Essential drugs - N - Nutrition - T - Treatment of communicable and non-communicable diseases - S - Safe water and sanitation Remember ELEMENTS",

Information bias occurs due to people's curiosity and confusion of goals when trying to choose a course of action. It may be of following types i) Repoing bias Individual with severe disease tends to have complete records therefore more complete information about exposures and greater association found. ii) Recall bias (memory bias) Those who have disease (cases) have a greater sensitivity for recalling exposure than those who dont have disease (controls). iii) Interviewer bias Caused by the action of the interviewer, e. g., Interviewer generally devote more time to cases as compared to controls. iv) Hawthorne bias (Attention bias) It is caused by change in behavior of human subjects of an experiment, simply becasue they know that they are being observed. For example, if we want to study the smoking as a risk factor for lung carcinoma and we take 2 groups (50 smokers and 50 nonsmoker) and follow them for 10 years. It may be possible that over the time study subjects may change their behavior, e. g. 5 out of 50 smokers quit smoking behavior. This will cause Hawthorne bias.

Correlation quantifies how well the two variables X and Y are related together, but one can not predict one unit change of one variable will cause how much change of the other variable. For this regression equation is needed. o If two variables are highly correlated, it then becomes possible to predict the value of the dependent variable from the value of the independent variable by using regression teachnique. Regression analysis is the mathematical modelling to describe the effect that one or more independent variables have on a dependent variable. o So, when there is distinct relation between two variables, one has to perform both the calculations, i. e. correlation coefficient followed by regression. If no relationship is established in correlation coefficient, regression is not required at all. Types of Regression There are following types of regression:? 1. Linear Regression In Linear Regression the influence of independent (explanatory) variable on a dependent (response) variable is linear, i. e. change in the independent variable will cause a change in the dependent variable that can be depicted by a straight line. Linear regression may be of two types: i) Simple linear regression: - Expresses the effect of one independent (X) variable on dependent variable (Y)- y = a + bx where? a = is a constant Ida intercept constant b is the regression coefficient x is the independent variable. y = is the dependent variable whose value is to be found out. ii) Multiple linear regression:- Expresses the effect of more than one independent variables on a dependent variable. 2. Curvilinear regression In some situations, the influence of independent variable on the dependent variable is like a curve (instead of straight line). The suffix 'linear' is still there because the curve can be conveed to line after some mathematical transformation such as logarithm and square. Curvilinear regression, similar to linear regression, may be of two types: i) Simple curvilinear regression:- influence of one independent variable on a dependent variable, with some power on independent variable y = a + b(x)6 ii) Multiple Curvilinear regression: Influence of more than one independent variables on a dependent variable, with some power on independent variables. y = a + b (x, )2 + C(X2)3 + d(x3)3 3. Non-linear regression Third type of regression is called non-linear regression which has curve like relationship. However; this term is used only for the relationship that cannot be conveed to linear form by any transformation. Coming to the Question o In the regression equation there is no square or logarithm. That means it is linear regression. o There is only one independent variable (x). o Therefore, this is simple linear regression which can be depicted by a straight line.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Plague Bioterrorism A bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, or other germs (agents) used to cause illness or death in people, or plants. These agents are typically found in nature, but it is possible that they could be changed to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicine, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, through water, or in food. Terrorists may use biological agents because they can be extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Some bioterrorism agents, like the smallpox virus, can be spread from person to person and some, like anthrax, can not. Bioterrorism Agent Categories Bioterrorism agents can be separated into three categories, depending on how easily they can be spread and the severity of illness or death they cause. Category A agents are considered the highest risk and Category C agents are those that are considered emerging threats for disease. Category A These high-priority agents include organisms or toxins that pose the highest risk to the public and national security because: They can be easily spread or transmitted from person to person They result in high death rates and have the potential for major public health impact. They might cause public panic and social disruption They require special action for public health preparedness. Category B These agetns are the second highest priority because They are moderately easy to spread They result in moderate illness rates and low death rates They require specific enhancements of CDC's laboratory capacity and enhanced disease monitoring. Category C These third highest priority agents include emerging pathogens that could be engineered for mass spread in the future because: They are easily available They are easily produced and spread They have potential for high morbidity and moality rates and major health impact.",
