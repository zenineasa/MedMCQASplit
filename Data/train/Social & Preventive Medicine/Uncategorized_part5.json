A Sub-center provides interface with the community at the grass-root level, providing all the primary health care services. As sub-centers are the first contact point with the community, the success of any nation wide programme would depend largely on well functioning sub-centers providing services of acceptable standard to the people.

        "exp": "Ans. C: Hypochlorous acid During chlorination of water, hypochlorous acid (HOC1) has main role in disinfection Chlorination of water When chlorine is added to water, it reacts to form a pH dependent equilibrium mixture of chlorine, hypochlorous acid and hydrochloric acid: C12 + H20 HOC1 + HC1 Depending on the pH, hypochlorous acid paly dissociates to hydrogen and hypochlorite ions: HOC1 H+ + C10- In acidic solution, the major species are C12 and HOC1 while in alkaline solution effectively only C10- is present. Very small concentrations of C102-, 0103-, C104- are also found Disinfection by chlorination can be problematic, in some circumstances. Chlorine can react with naturally occurring organic compounds found in the water supply to produce compounds known as disinfection byproducts (DBPs). The most common DBPs are trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAS). Due to the potential carcinogenicity of these compounds, drinking water regulations across the developed world require regular monitoring of the concentration of these compounds in the distribution systems of municipal water systems. There are also other concerns regarding chlorine, including its volatile nature which causes it to disappear too quickly from the water system, and aesthetic concerns such as taste and odour.",

        "question": "Which of the following is not included in phase I clinical trial of medicine: March 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Epilepsy patients Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into four phases. Each phase of the drug approval process is treated as a separate clinical trial. The drug-development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years. If the drug successfully passes through Phases I, II, and III, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Phase IV are 'post-approval' studies. Before pharmaceutical companies sta clinical trials on a drug, they conduct extensive pre-clinical studies. Pre-clinical studies involve in vitro (i. e., test tube or laboratory) studies and trials on animal populations (in vivo) in order to obtain preliminary efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetic information and to assist pharmaceutical companies in deciding whether it is wohwhile to go ahead with fuher testing. Phase 0 trials are also known as human microdosing studies. Distinctive features of Phase 0 trials include the administration of single subtherapeutic doses of the study drug to a small number of subjects (10 to 15) to gather preliminary data on the agent's pharmacokinetics (how the body processes the drug) and pharmacodynamics (how the drug works in the body). A Phase 0 study gives no data on safety or efficacy, being by definition a dose too low to cause any therapeutic effect. Phase I trials are the first stage of testing in human subjects. Normally, a small (20-80) group of healthy volunteers will be selected. This phase includes trials designed to assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug. These trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. Phase I trials also normally include dose-ranging, also called dose escalation, studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. Phase I trials most often include healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances when real patients are used, such as patients who have end-stage disease and lack other treatment options. This exception to the rule most often occurs in oncology (cancer) and HIV drug trials. Once the initial safety of the study drug has been confirmed in Phase I trials, Phase II trials are performed on larger groups (20-300) and are designed to assess how well the drug works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers and patients. Phase IIA is specifically designed to assess dosing requirements (how much drug should be given). Phase IIB is specifically designed to study efficacy (how well the drug works at the prescribed dose(s). Phase III studies are randomized controlled multicenter trials on large patient groups (300-3, 000 or more depending upon the disease/medical condition studied) and are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the drug is, in comparison with current 'gold standard' treatment. Because of their size and comparatively long duration, Phase III trials are the most expensive, time-consuming and difficult trials to design and run, especially in therapies for chronic medical conditions. Phase IV trial is also known as Post Marketing Surveillance Trial. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance) and ongoing technical suppo of a drug after it receives permission to be sold. Phase IV studies may be required by regulatory authorities or may be undeaken by the sponsoring company for competitive or other reasons.",

A broader concept is emerging, that is, to develop an overall integrated programme for the Prevention and control of NCDs as part of primary health care systems, simultaneously attacking several risk factors known to be implicated in the development of NCDs. Such concerted preventive actions should reduce not only cardiovascular diseases but also other major NCDs. \" Prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs): 1. Population strategy: Focus on control of underlying causes (risk factors) in whole populations, 'not merely by individuals' Principle: Small changes in risk factor levels in total populations can achieve the biggest reduction in mortality, thus aim should be 'to shift the whole curve or risk factors towards biological normality' Specific interventions: 1. Dietary changes: Dietary modification is the principal preventive strategy in the prevention of CHD; WHO recommended changes (Prudent diet-dietary goals): i. Reduction of fat intake to < 20 - 30 % of total energy intake ii. Consumption of saturated fats < 10 % of total energy intake iii. Reduction in dietary cholesterol to < 100 mg/1000 kcal/day iv Increase in complex carbohydrate consumption v. Reduction of salt intake to <= 5 gms per day vi. Avoidance of alcohol consumption vii. Primordial prevention 2. High risk strategy: Identifying risk: by using simple tests for blood pressure, serum cholesterol measurement El Specific advice: to those identified at high risk 3. Secondary prevention: Aim: to prevent reoccurrence and progression of NCDs Most promising results have come from beta-blockers Following information has been added in 22nd /e of Park Recently, the WHO has developed a survey methodology know as \"the STEPS Non-communicable Disease Risk Factors Survey\" to help countries establish NCD surveillance system.

Coliform presence in a water sample does not necessarily mean that the water is hazardous to drink. The test is a screening technique, and a positive result (more than 1 colony per 100 ml water sample) means the water should be retested.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Lead time o In respect to screening test and diagnostic test, a disease passes through following phase, sequentially. i) Disease onset --> Disease process just staed. ii) First possible point of diagnosis The earliest point in disease process where a diagnosis can be made, i. e., before this point diagnosis can not be made by any test. iii) Final critical point of diagnosis --> The point after which even diagnosis and treatment will not change the outcome. iv). Usual time of diagnosis --> Time in disease process when most of the people are diagnosed by usual diagnostic procedure (not screening test). o So, by screening, the intention is to diagnosis the disease between:? i) First possible point Before that diagnosis cannot made by any test. ii) Final critical point After that treatment will not change the outcome. o The time period between these two points is called screening time and all screening tests are aimed to detect the disease during this period. Lead time o The lead time is the time period between diagnosis by early detection (i. e., earliest point of diagnosis by screening test) and diagnosis by standard diagnostic tests. o Lead time is the advantage gained by screening. Implications of lead time & Screening time o If the person is diagnosed in screening time (from first possible point to final critical point), the outcome can be improved/changed by early treatment. o If the person is diagnosed after screening time (after final critical point), the outcome will not change even with treatment. o So, though the lead time is the advantage gained by screening, only the earlier poion of lead time, i. e., screening time is impoant for screening tests. o For example if the usual outcome of a disease is death (without any intervention). Following may occur: - i) Person is diagnosed before final critical point in screening time ---> Person may survive or death may be postponed by treatment (outcome is altered/improved). ii) Person is diagnosed after final critical point, even if in lead time (i. e., poion of lead time after screening time) ----> Person will die even with treatment, at the same time (the time of death without any intervention). iii) Screening is not useful for the diseases, which do not have lead time (screening time is a poion of lead time) --> Because there is nothing to be gained by screening as the disease will be diagnosed at the usual time of diagnosis (as by standard diagnostic tests).",

        "question": "The number of girls a woman would bear if she passes through her reproductive age with the same feility rate gives: March 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Gross reproductive rate The net reproduction rate (NRR) measures the effective feility in a population, taking account not only of bihs but also of the fact that not all women born will survive to their own reproductive years. The NRR is the average number of daughters of reproductive age that a woman would have if she experienced over her lifetime the prevailing age-specific rates of feility and if her daughters experienced the prevailing rates of moality. The gross reproduction rate (GRR) for a paicular year is the average number of daughters that a woman would have if she experienced over her lifetime the age-specific feility rates of that year. In that it refers only to the number of daughters born to women, not the total number of children, it is a special case of the (period) total feility rate; in most circumstances (unless the sex ratio at bih is highly unequal) the GRR equals roughly half the TFR. The general feility rate is similar to the crude bih rate except that it uses a more restricted denominator, the female population of childbearing age, ages 15 to 49. Age-specific feility rates (also called age-specific bih rates) are similar to the crude bih rate but are calculated for specific age groups of women of childbearing age. The range of childbearing ages is conventionally considered to be ages 15 to 49 (sometimes 15 to 44 is used), and a full set of age-specific feility rates would span this interval-usually either in single-year age groups or, more commonly, in five-year groups: 15 to 19, 20 to 24,..., 45 to 49. Marital feility rates can be calculated either for the full range of reproductive ages (15 to 49 or 15 to 44) or as age-specific rates. The numerator is usually taken as the total number of live-bihs to women in the specified age range, regardless of the marital status of the mother; the denominator is the number of currently married women in the specified age range The total feility rate (TFR) at a given time (technically referred to as the period total feility rate) is the average number of children a woman would bear in her life if she experienced the age-specific feility rates prevailing at that time.",

Broadly these comprise: - i) Travellers All travellers (including infants) exposed to yellow fever or passing through endemic zones of yellow fever must posses a valid international ceificate fo vaccination against yellow fever before they are allowed to enter yellow fever receptive areas like India. The validity of the ceificate begins 10 days after the date of vaccination and extends up to 10 years. Revaccination performed before the end of the validity of ceicicate renders the ceificate valid for a fuher period of 10 years staing on the day of revaccination. If no such ceificate fo vaccination is available, the travellar is placed on quarantine for 6 days from the date of leaving an infected area. ii) Mosquitoes The aircraft and ships arriving from endemic areas are subjected to aerosol spraying with prescribed insecticides.

        "question": "Vector for Yellow fever is: September 2011, March 2013",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Aedes Aedes aegypti is the main vector for yellow fever across world Yellow fever/ \"Yellow Jack\" It is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease. The virus is a 40 to 50 nm enveloped RNA virus with positive sense of the Flaviviridae family. The yellow fever virus is transmitted by the bite of female mosquitoes (the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, and other species) and is found in tropical and subtropical areas in South America and Africa, but not in Asia. The only known hosts of the virus are primates and several species of mosquito. In the 19th century, yellow fever was deemed one of the most dangerous infectious diseases. Yellow fever presents in most cases with fever, nausea, and pain and it generally subsides after several days. In some patients, a toxic phase follows, in which liver damage with jaundice (giving the name of the disease) can occur and lead to death. Because of the increased bleeding tendency (bleeding diathesis), yellow fever belongs to the group of hemorrhagic fevers. A safe and effective vaccine against yellow fever has existed since the middle of the 20th century and some countries require vaccinations for travelers. Since no therapy is known, vaccination programs are, along with measures to reduce the population of the transmitting mosquito, of great impoance in affected areas. Since the 1980s, the number of cases of yellow fever has been increasing, making it a reemerging disease Yellow fever is caused by the yellow fever virus, a 40 to 50 nm wide enveloped RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae. The viruses infect amongst others monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. After entering the host cells, the viral genome is replicated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in the so-called vesicle packets. After transmission of the virus from a mosquito the viruses replicate in the lymph nodes and infect dendritic cells in paicular. From there they reach the liver and infect hepatocytes (probably indirectly Kupffer cells), which leads to eosinophilic degradation of these cells and to the release of cytokines. Necrotic masses (Councilman bodies) appear in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. If yellow fever is suspected, the virus cannot be confirmed until six to ten days after the illness. A direct confirmation can be obtained by Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction where the genome of the virus is amplified. Another direct approach is the isolation of the virus and its growth in cell culture using blood plasma; this can take one to four weeks. Serologically an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay during the acute phase of the disease using specific IgM against yellow fever or an increase in specific IgG-titer (compared to an earlier sample) can confirm yellow fever. Together with clinical symptoms, the detection of IgM or a fourfold increase in IgG-titer is considered sufficient indication for yellow fever. Since these tests can cross-react with other Flaviviruses, like Dengue virus, these indirect methods can never prove yellow fever infection. In a differential diagnosis, infections with yellow fever have to be distinguished from other feverish illnesses like malaria. Other viral hemorrhagic fever, such as Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Marburg virus or Junin virus have to be excluded as cause. For journeys into affected areas, vaccination is highly recommended since mostly non-native people are affected by severe cases of yellow fever. The protective effect is established 10 days after vaccination in 95% of the vaccinated people and lasts for at least 10 years (even 30 years later, 81% of patients retained the immunity). The attenuated live vaccine (stem 17D) was developed in 1937 by Max Theiler from a diseased patient in Ghana and is produced in chicken eggs. WHO recommends routine vaccinations for people living in endemic areas between the 9th and 12th month after bih.",

In contrast, measles vaccine is injected subcutaneously -> it immediately enters into circulation. So, measles vaccine has incubation period less (3 days) than natural infection.

An increase of nitrates in water is often associated with farming feilizer, pesticide or poor sanitary activities. The WHO guideline for nitrates in drinking water is established to prevent methemoglobinaemia (blue babies), which is lethal in babies. It can be potentially hazardous with health risks for considerable groups of people and depends on the conversion of nitrates to nitrites and wells which were shallow, dug of located on large farms, or springs were more likely to have elevated concentrations of nitrates. Contamination of drinking water by nitrates is an evolving public health concern since nitrates can undergo endogenous reduction to nitrites (nitrate (III)), and nitrosation of nitrites can form N-nitrose compounds, which are potent carcinogens.",

Some definitions of tuberculosis cases and treatment Case of tuberculosis: A patient in whom tuberculosis has been confirmed by bacteriology or diagnosed by a clinician. Sputum smear examination - Laboratory technique to screen sputum for tuberculosis, where acid fast bacilli (AFB) are stained red by the Ziehl Neelsen method, and then identified and counted using microscopy. Smear positive tuberculosis - At least one initial sputum smears positive for AFB or one AFB positive. Smear negative tuberculosis - At least two negative smears, but tuberculosis suggestive symptoms and X-ray abnormalities or positive culture. Adherence - Person takes appropriate drug regimen for required time (also known as compliance). New case - A patient with sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis who has never had treatment for tuberculosis or has taken anti - tuberculosis drugs for less than 4 weeks. Relapse - A patient who returns smear positive having previously been treated for tuberculosis and declared cured after the completion of his treatment. Failure case - A patient who was initially smear positive, who began treatment and who remained or became smear positive again at five months or later during the course of treatment. Return after default - A patient who returns sputum smear positive, after having left treatment for at least two months. Transfer in - A patient recorded in another administrative area register and transferred into another area to continue treatment (treatment results should be repoed to the district where the patient was initially registered). Transfer out - A patient who has been transferred to another area register and treatment results are not known. Cured - Initially smear positive patient who completed treatment and had negative smear result on at least two occasions (one at treatment completion). Treatment completed - Initially smear negative patient who received full course of treatment, or smear positive who completed treatment, with negative smear at the end of initial phase, but no or only one negative smear during continuation and none at treatment end. Coho - A group of patients in whom TB has been diagnosed, and who were registered for treatment during a specified time period (e. g. the coho of new smear-positive cases registered in the calender year 2003). This group forms the denominator for calculating treatment outcomes. The sum of the treatment outcomes, plus any case for which no outcome is recorded (eg. still on treatment) should equal the number of cases registered.

Cyclopropagative - The agent changes in form & multiplies in the body of ahropod e. g. malarial parasites in mosquito c.

Following impoant points require specific mention here:? o Though qualitative (categorial) data do not have numerical value, some times numerical value is used to classify the limit of qualitative data. For example: - 1). All low bih weight children will have bih weight less than 2500 gm. So, a) Bih weight (which may be 2200 gm, 2500 gm, 2600 gm) is a continuous variable. b). Low bih weight (< 2500 gm) is a qualitative data because either a newborn have low bih weight or not. 2) Blood cholesterol level (which may be 70, 80, 90, 200 mg/dl) is a quantitative variable but when it comes high or low blood cholesterol level, it becomes qualitative variable because a preson may either have low or high cholesterol level. 3) Similarly blood sugar level is quantitative variable, while high or low blood sugar (presence or absence of diabetes) is a qualitative variable. 4) Blood hemoglobin is a quantitative variable, while high or low hemoglobin (Presence or absence of anemia) is a qualitative variable. Note: o Pulse rate (PR) is considered as a continuous variable. o Immediately question comes to mind that how can pulse rate be a continues variable when pulse rate can only be 70/71... beats per minute but not in between value (70. 1, 70. 5...). However, this is only true when we count pulse for only 1 minute. In other scenario, if the pulse rate is counted for 3 minutes and it comes 216, then the pulse rate will be 72. 3 beats per minute ---> Therefore, pulse rate is considered as a continuous variable. o If you still have doubt, read following statement? \"Body temperature, pulse rate, height, weight, and age are all continuous numerical variables\".. statistics for health care professional.",

C: 0. 5 to 3 microns Dust paicle within the range of 0. 5-3 micron, is a health hazard producing, after a variable exposure, a lung disease known as pneumoconiosis Common Occupational Lung Diseases Asbestosis, caused by exposure to asbestos paicles. Often found among people who worked in shipyards, asbestos mines, and factories that refined or used asbestos to manufacture products. Black lung (Coalworker's pneumoconiosis) which affects coal workers Chronic Beryllium disease (CBD), which affects workers in a variety of metallurgical occupations Byssinosis (brown lung disease), often occurs in cotton and textile workers when bacteria released from cotton or other materials is inhaled and grows with the lungs. This is often associated with poor ventilation systems. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, this can affect people who work in office buildings whose air-conditioning systems are contaminated by ceain fungi and bacteria. Occupational asthma, can affect people who work with a variety of materials. This includes animals (dander), carbamates (urethanes), dyes, epoxy resins and enzymes used in detergent, leather goods, latex, and automotive paints Silicosis often developed by people who worked with clay, sand and stone dust including miners, stone cutters and sandblasters. How Diseases Develop Pneumoconiosis is the classification of diseases that develop as the result of occupational exposure to dust. Occupational lung diseases develop based on the size and type of paicles inhaled and where the inhaled paicle end up. Larger paicles are more likely to get stuck in the nose and larger airways but smaller paicles can reach the alveoli where they can potentially be absorbed into the bloodstream. When inhaled paicles come in contact with the wall of the airway they do not become airborne again. This is called deposition and can occur in one of four ways: - Sedimentation: When gravity causes paicles to settle, tends to occur in larger airways. - Ineial impaction: Often occurs in the nose and larger airways, it happens when an airway changes direction - Interception: This form of deposition occurs with fibrous dust paicles (including asbestos fibers) or any other irregular shaped paicles. Due to their shape they often avoid deposition by sedimentation or ineial impaction but are deposited in the walls of the bronchioles which are lined with epithelial cells. - Diffusion: Behavior of small aerosol paicles which encounter and are affected by molecules of air. During regular breathing (at rest) about 10% of compact paicles of 0. 5 to 1 micron diameter are deposited in the alveoli with the vast majority being exhaled.",

The \"waterline\" represents the demarcation between apparent and inapparent disease. Epidemiologist is concerned with Hidden poion of iceberg whereas clinician is concerned with tip of iceberg. Screening is done for Hidden poion of iceberg whereas diagnosis is done for tip of iceberg. Iceberg phenomenon of disease is not shown by rabies, tetanus and measles. The clinician concerned only with the tip of iceberg, i. e symptomatic cases that are seen in clinical treatment, this can result in inaccurate view of the nature and causes of a disease results because the minority of the cases are studied (hidden cases:- submerged poion of ice berg is not studied) -3 Clinician's Fallacy. iseases with a great deal of subclinical infection (therefore have iceberg phenomenon) are:- Rubella Polio Japanese encephalitis Influenza Mumps Hepatitis A and B Diphtheria",

        "question": "Group of 4-8 expes talking in front of a large group of audience is known as: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. D: Panel Discussion In a panel discussion, 4-8 persons who are qualified to talk about the topic sit and discuss a given problem, or the topic, in front of a large group of audience Panel Discussion A panel consists of a small group of four or eight persons, who carry on a guided and informal discussion before an audience as if the panel were meeting alone. The proceedings of the panel should be the same as those described for informal discussion: volunteering of facts, asking questions, stating opinions-all expressed with geniality, with respect for the contributions of other members, without speech making, and without making invidious personal references. This primary function should occupy approximately two-thirds of the allotted time-say foy minutes of an hour's meeting. The secondary function of the panel is to answer questions from the audience. This discussion method is suitable for use when a relatively large audience is anticipated. The disadvantage of the method is that it confines most of the discussion to the panel itself. The audience listens and is given a chance to ask questions, but for the most pa is passive and receptive. Panel discussions, if well conducted, are usually more interesting to the audience than is the single-speaker forum. They provide sufficiently varied clash of opinion and presentation of facts to give even the quiet members of the audience a feeling of vicarious paicipation. Quality and tasks of leadership in panel discussion are similar to those described for informal discussion. The leader must in addition take special care to select panel members who can think and speak effectively. He must also be sure that they prepare themselves to discuss the subject. During the discussion by the panel the leader has substantially the same duties as in informal discussion except that he should keep himself more in the background as chairman of the panel. He can do so because each member of the panel is in reality an assistant to the leader and is responsible for specific contributions to the proceedings. When the subject is thrown open to the house, it is the leader's job to recognize appropriate questions and to reject those not bearing on the subject or involving personalities. Some questions he may answer himself, but usually he should repeat the question and call upon one of the panel to answer it. By preliminary announcement the leader may also tell the audience that they may direct questions at paicular members of the panel if they choose. In any case, during the question period the leader needs to maintain strict control. On many occasions this may be the toughest pa of his assignment to carry off efficiently and with good humor. While it is customary to confine audience questions to a specific period, some leaders permit questions from the floor at any time. Unless very carefully limited by the leader, this practice may interfere with effective discussion by the panel. Arranging the panel properly will lend effectiveness to this form of discussion. The members should face the audience. It is impoant that each panel member adjust his chair so that he can see every other member without effo the chairman will also find that the best places for his readiest speakers are at the extreme ends of the table. He should keep the more reticent members close to, him so that he can readily draw them out with direct questions. If the quieter ones sit on the fringes of the panel, the more voluble members are quite likely to monopolize the discussion.",

C: Escherichia coli Coliforms: Gram-negative, non spore-forming, oxidase-negative, rod-shaped facultative anaerobic bacteria that ferment lactose to acid and gas within 24-48h at 36+-2degC. Not specific indicators of fecal pollution. Thermotolerant coliforms: Coliforms that produce acid and gas from lactose at 44. 5+-0. 2degC within 24+-2h, also known as fecal coliforms due to their role as fecal indicators. Escherichia coli (E. coli): Thermophilic coliforms that produce indole from tryptophan. Most appropriate group of coliforms to indicate fecal pollution from warm-blooded animals. Fecal streptococci (FS): Gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci from selective media (e. g. azide dextrose broth or m Enterococcus agar) that grow on bile aesculin agar and at 45degC, belonging to the genera Enterococcus and Streptococcus possessing the Lancefield group D antigen. Enterococci: All fecal streptococci that grow at pH 9. 6, 10deg and 45degC and in 6. 5% Na. C1. Nearly all are members of the genus Enterococcus, and also fulfil the following criteria: resistance to 60degC for 30 min and ability to reduce 0. 1% methylene blue. The enterococci are a subset of fecal streptococci that grow under the conditions outlined above. Sulphite-reducing clostridia (SRC): Gram-positive, spore-forming, non-motile, strictly anaerobic rods that reduce sulphite to H2S. Clostridium perfringens: As for SRC, but also ferment lactose, sucrose and inositol with the production of gas, produce a stormy clot fermentation with milk, reduce nitrate, hydrolyse gelatin and produce lecithinase and acid phosphatase.",

        "exp": "Ans. is `c' i. e., Chi-square test Observations in the given question are in the form of qualitative data (anemia present or not). Thus Chi-square test should be used. Chi square test Is used when the observation are in the form of propoions (for qualitative data) The outcome are in clear cut answers; yes or no. As in the example the HBs. Ag is either present or not present. In contrast when the observation is normally distributed in the population e. g blood pressure, blood sugar; student test is used. In the example comparing the occurence of hepatitis B surface antigen in medical and dental students, use of chi square analysis is appropriate because the outcome variables are dichomatous. Students are classified by the presence or absence of HBs. Ag. Student t test is used when the outcome variable is normally distributed in population (for quantitative data) e. g blood pressure, blood glucose. In the example student t test is used to assess the difference between mean systolic pressure of pregnant and non pregnant women ( to know the effect of pregnancy on mean systolic blood pressure) because mean systolic blood pressure is normally distributed in the population. Every single lady has a mean systolic blood pressure. It may be low or high, but she has a value of mean systolic blood pressure. Students t test may be following types: Unpaired t test (Independent t test): It compares the mean of two small samples: The data is unpaired from two independent sample. for example, blood sugar concentration is measured in two different group (A group of 10 patients and other group of 8 patient). To test the significance of difference between the means of the two groups, unpaired t test is used. Paired t test: It compares the mean in paired data, before and after the intervention from same sample. For example, Blood sugar level in a sample of 10 patients is measure before giving and after giving the oral hypoglycemic. In this condition paired t test is used. Chi-square test Vs Student t test In the example student t test is used to assess the difference between mean systolic pressure of pregnant and non pregnant women ( to know the effect of pregnancy on mean systolic blood pressure) because mean systolic blood pressure is normally distributed in the population. Every single lady has a mean systolic blood pressure. It may be low or high, but she has a value of mean systolic blood pressure. But suppose we change the example in a way that we make a clear cut definition of hypertension ( such as mean systolic blood pressure over 140 mm of Hg will be taken to be hypertension) and then look for hypertension among pregnant and non-pregnant women. The test now used to analyse the outcome will be chi square test since the outcomes are now in the form of dichomatous data i. e yes or no (a woman is either hypeensive or not hypeensive. This is in contrast to mean systolic blood pressure which was normally distributed among ladies; every lady had one value of mean systolic blood pressure). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (F test/ F ratio) ANOVA is considered as an extension of the student t test for the significance of the difference between two sample means. The student t test can be used only for making just one comparison (between two sample means), or between a sample mean and hypothesized population mean. ANOVA is used when more than one comparison is to be made (When means of more than two groups are being compared). For example, BP is measured in more than two groups of men (married, unmarried, widowed, separated and divorced). In this situation ANOVA test is best.",

The following epidemiological-indices are used in tuberculosis problem measurement and programme strategy:? 1. Prevalence of infection It is the percentage of individuals who show a positive reaction to the standard tuberculin test. 2. Incidence of infection (Annual infection rate) It is the percentage of population under study who will be newly infected by M. tuberculosis among the non-infected of the preceding survey during the course of one year. It reflects the annual risk of being infected (or reinfected) in a given community, i. e. it expresses the attacking force of tuberculosis in a community. It is also known as tuberculin conversion index. This parameter is considered one of the best indicators for evaluating the tuberculosis problem and its trend. 3. Prevalence of disease or case rate It is the percentage of individuals whose sputum is positive for tubercle bacilli on microscopic examination. It is the best available practical index to estimate the number of infectious cases or case load in a community. 4. Incidence of new cases It is the percentage of new TB cases (confirmed by bacteriological examination) per 1000 population occurring during one year. 5. Prevalence of suspected cases This is based on X-ray examination of chest. 6. Prevalence of drug resistant cases It is the prevalence of patient excreting tubercle bacilli resistant to anti-tubercular drugs. 7. Moality rate The number of deaths from tuberculosis every year per 1, 000 population. In this question Option a - Prevalance of infection. Option b - Incidence of infection (annual infection rate).

In order to fulfil these aims, three rather different classes of epidemiological studies may be mentioned: descriptive studies, analytical studies, and experimental or intervention studies.

The objective is to prevent the transition of the disease proecess from impairment to handicap. The sequence of events leading to disability and handicap are: Disease ---> impairment -4 disability -4 handicap Impairment - is defined as any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological or anatomical structure or function eg. loss of foot, defective vision or mental retardation. Disability - it is inability to carry out ceain activities considered normal for human beings, because of his 'impairment'. Handicap means that the individual with 'disability' is not able to perform his duties and obligations expected of him in the society. For example: Accident is the disease (or disorder) Loss of foot is the impairment Cannot walk is the disability Unemployed is the handicap Lets see other Modes of intervention in the disease process. Modes of Intervention Modes of intervention can be defined as any attempt to interrupt the usual sequence of any disease process (right from the risk factors to handicap) There are 5 modes of intervention: Health promotion Specific protection Early diagnosis Disability limitation Rehabilitation I. Health promotion Health promotion is not directed against any paicular disease, but is intended to improve the health of people through a variety of interventions like: i) Health education ii) Environmental modifications - Like provision of safe water, installation of sanitary latrines, control of insects and rodents etc. iii) Nutritional interventions - Like food foification, child feeding programmes. iv) Lifestyle and behavioural changes 2. Specific protection is directed against specific disease through interventions such as: - Immunization - Chemoprophylaxis - Protection from carcinogens etc. 3. Early diagnosis and treatment It involves detecting and treating the disease while the biochemical morphological and functional changes are still reversible. Thus it prevents ove disease and disablement. Early diagnosis and treatment are the only effective mode of intervention in following diseases. - Tuberculosis - Leprosy - STD 4. Disability limitation - Already described 5. Rehabilitation It is the combined and coordinated use of medical, social, educational and vocational measures for enabling the handicapped persons to achieve social integration (social integration is defined as the active paicipation of disabled and handicapped people in the mainstream of community life) Option 'a' - Reducing occurence of polio by immunization is specific protection Option 'b' - Arranging for schooling of child suffering from PRPP is rehabilitation Option 'c' - Resting affected limbs in neutral position disability limitation Option 'd' - Providing calipers for walking rehabilitation",

Read the mechanism of action of slow sand filter and there will be no confusion. Mechanism of action of slow sand filter Slow sand filter work through the, formation of a gelatinous layer called vital layer or hypogeal layer or Schmutzdecke in the top few cm of sand layer. This layer is formed in the first 10-20 days of operation. The formation of vital layer is known as \"Ripening of the filter\". This vital layer consists of bacteria, fungi, Protozoa, and a range of aquatic insect larvae. As waste passes through vital layer, particles of foreign matter are trapped in the mucilaginous matrix and dissolved organic material is absorbed and metabolized by bacterial, fungi and protozoa -> Vital layer has mechanical (physical) as well as biological action. So, the vital layer acts as the heart of slow sand filter.",
