Breast milk output is maximum at 5-6 months; approx. 730 ml/day thereafter it starts decreasing, at 12 months it is around 525 ml/day. Iron content of human milk is low but it's bioavailability is high. The coefficient of uptake is as high as 70% whereas it is only 30% for cow's milk & infant formulas. The calcium/phosphorus ratio of human milk is high so that the uptake of calcium is better then cow's milk. Egg protein is the reference protein but human milk protein is the best protein for infants therefore, human milk protein is considered a reference protein for infants, and other milk or formula feed are compared with it. For far and Arneil's textbook of pediatrics 6/e p400 writes-Protein quality can be expressed numerically either by essential 'amino acid score' or 'net protein utilization ', the proportion of ingested protein which is retained. Human milk is used as a reference protein in both cases. \" \"The reference protein composition is taken from breast milk for infants.... \" - Wild-type food in health promotion and disease prevention: the Columbus concept By Fabien De Meester, Ronald Ross Watson p94",
