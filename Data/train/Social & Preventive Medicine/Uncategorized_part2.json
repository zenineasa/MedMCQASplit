        "question": "Human milk as compared to cow's milk is: March 2011, March 2013 (b)",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Rich in lactose Lactose content of human milk is 7. 4g/100 gm whereas that of cows milk is 4. 4 g/100 grams Human milk The initial milk produced is often referred to as colostrum, which is high in the immunoglobulin IgA, which coats the gastrointestinal tract. This helps to protect the newborn until its own immune system is functioning properly, and creates a mild laxative effect, expelling meconium and helping to prevent the build up of bilirubin (a contributory factor in jaundice). During the first few days after delivery, the breasts produce colostrum. This is a thin yellowish fluid that is the same fluid that leaks from the breasts during pregnancy. It is rich in protein and antibodies that provide passive immunity to the baby (the baby's immune system is not fully developed at bih). Colostrum also helps the newborn's digestive system to grow and function properly. After 3 to 4 days, breasts will begin producing milk that is thin, watery, and sweet. This quenches the baby's thirst and provides the proteins, sugar, and minerals that the baby needs. Foremilk, the milk released at the beginning of a feed, is watery, low in fat, and high in carbohydrates relative to the creamier hindmilk, which is released as the feed progresses. The breast can never be truly \"emptied, \" since milk production is a continuous biological process. The level of Immunoglobilin A (IgA) in breast milk remains high from day 10 until at least 7. 5 months post-paum. Human milk contains 1. 1% protein, 3. 4% fat, 7. 4% carbohydrates, and 0. 1% ash (minerals). Carbohydrates are mainly lactose. The fat fraction contains specific triglycerides of palmitic and oleic acid (0-P-0 triglycerides), and also quite a large quantity of lipids with trans bonds. They are vaccenic acid, and Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) accounting for up to 6% of the human milk fat. The principal proteins are casein (homologous to bovine beta-casein), alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, IgA, lysozyme, and serum albumin. In an acidic environment such as the stomach, alpha-lactalbumin unfolds into a different form and binds oleic acid to form a complex called HAMLET. Non-protein nitrogen-containing compounds, making up 25% of the milk's nitrogen, include urea, uric acid, creatine, creatinine, amino acids, and nucleotides. It is now universally recognized that there is no commercial formula that can equal breast milk. In addition to the appropriate amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat, breast milk provides vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, and hormones - all of the things that a growing infant will require. Breast milk also contains antibodies and lymphocytes from the mother that help the baby resist infections. The immune function of breast milk is individualized, as the mother, through her touching and taking care of the baby, comes into contact with pathogens that colonize the baby, and, as a consequence, her body makes the appropriate antibodies and immune cells. This is the reason why breast milk contains very little iron, as iron is an essential precursor to the activation of micro bacteria and gut flora; providing iron in the milk would lead to infection. However, the internal iron supplies of the infant, held in the hepatic cells of the liver, are exhausted at 4-6 months, hence this is the time that complimentary feeding is introduced, as to prevent anemia (recommended by WHO). Whole cow's milk It does not contain sufficient vitamin E, iron, or essential fatty acids, which can make infants fed on cow's milk anemic. Whole cow's milk also contains excessive amounts of protein (3. 2 g/ 100 gram), sodium, and potassium, which may put a strain on an infant's immature kidneys. In addition, the proteins and fats in whole cow's milk are more difficult for an infant to digest and absorb than the ones in breast milk. A significant minority of infants are allergic to one or more of the constituents of cow's milk, most often the cow's milk proteins. These problems can also affect infant formulas derived from cow's milk.",

Epidermal nevus Epidermal nevi are hamaomas that are characterized by hyperplasia of the epidermis and adnexal structures. These nevi may be classified into a number of distinct variants which are based on clinical morphology, extent of involvement and the predominant epidermal structure in the lesion. Variants of the epidermal nevi are? - Verrucuous epidermal nevus - Nevus sebaceous - Nevus comedonicus - Eccrine nevus - Apocrine nevus - Becker's nevus - White sponge nevus Verrucuous epidermal nevus Verrucuous epidermal nevus consists of hyperplasia of the surface epidermis and typically appears as verrucuous papules that coalasce to. form well demarcated, skin colored to brown, papillomatous plaque. Most lesions are present at bih and develop during infancy. They enlarge slowly during childhood and generally reach a stable size at adolescence. Lesions may be localized or diffuse. Linear configurations are common especially on the limbs and may follow skin tension lines or Blaschko's lines. The salient histological features are? Perinuclear vacuolization of the cells in the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum. Irregular cellular boundaries peripheral to the vacuolization and increased number of irregularly shaped large keratohyaline granules. Compact hyperkeratosis in stratum corneum. Darner white disease Autosomal dominant disease. Males and. females are equally affected Darner white disease is not present at bih and usually begins in the first or second decade.

The relationship is sufficiently strong for infant moality rates on occasion to have been used as indicators of income levels when the requisite data for computing the latter are missing. Gordon et al. have suggested that the death rate of children in their second year of life may be a better indicator of general health levels than infant morality, which responds to a number of influences not present at other ages.

Screening may be Prescriptive screening: - people are screened for their own benefit. For example:- case detection by pap smear. Prospective screening: - people are screened for other's benefit. For example:- screening of immigrant for the disease which is not present in that area. Screening test Screening test is a test for a particular disease given to asymptomatic people.",

From above mentioned lines it is very difficult to understand that what the quaile is. I am trying to explain in very simple language:? o A quaile divides the data into four equal pas. o That means the data will have four equal pas i. e., 25 percent each. o So, the number of intercepts required will be 3, i. e., Q1, Q2, Q3. Q 1 is first (lowest) quale Q2 is second quaile Q3 is third (highest quaile) From above figure it is clear that: - i) Zero - Q I will cover 25% value ii) Zero - Q2 will cover 50 % value iii) Zero - Q3 will cover 75% value. iv) Zero - 100 will cover 100% value Zero - Ql, Ql- Q2, Q2-Q3 and Q3-100 all will cover 25% values among each of them.

Phase 1 no viruses circulating among animals have been repoed to cause infections in humans. In Phase 2 an animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans, and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat. In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassoant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassoant virus able to cause \"community-level outbreaks. \" Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion. Phase 5 is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. While most countries will not be affected at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent. Phase 6, the pandemic phase, is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5.

It involves provision of lunch free of cost to school-children on all working days. The key objectives of the programme are: protecting children from classroom hunger, increasing school enrolment and attendance, improved socialisation among children belonging to all castes, addressing malnutrition, and social empowerment through provision of employment to women. The scheme has a long history especially in the state of Tamil Nadu introduced statewide by the then Chief Minister K. Kamaraj in 1960s and later expanded by M. G. Ramachandran government in 1982 has been adopted by most of the states in India after a landmark direction by the Supreme Cou of India on November 28, 2001. The success of this scheme is illustrated by the tremendous increase in the school paicipation and completion rates in the state of Tamil Nadu. 12 crore (120 million) children are so far covered under the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, which is the largest school lunch programme in the world. Allocation for this programme has been enhanced from Rs 3010 crore to Rs 4813 crore (Rs 48 billion 1. 3 million) in 2006-2007 A mid day meal should provide at least one-third of the total energy requirement, and half of the protein need A mid day school meal consists of (g/day/ child): Cereals and millets: 75; Pulses: 30; Oils and fats: 8; Leafy vegetables: 30; Non-leafy vegetables: 30",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Pig In Japanese encephalitis, pigs are the amplifier host (they themselves didn't manifest ove symptoms but circulate the virus) Japanese encephalitis/ Japanese B encephalitis The Japanese encephalitis virus is a virus from the family Flaviviridae. Domestic pigs and wild birds (herons) are reservoirs of the virus; transmission to humans may cause severe symptoms. One of the most impoant vectors of this disease is the mosquito Culex tritaeniorhynchus. This disease is most prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Far East. Japanese encephalitis has an incubation period of 5 to 15 days and the vast majority of infections are asymptomatic Only 1 in 250 infections develop into encephalitis. Severe rigors mark the onset of this disease in humans. Fever, headache and malaise are other non-specific symptoms of this disease which may last for a period of between 1 and 6 days. Signs which develop during the acute encephalitic stage include neck rigidity, cachexia, hemiparesis, convulsions and a raised body temperature between 38 and 41 degrees Celsius. Moality of this disease varies but is generally much higher in children. Increased microglial activation following JEV infection has been found to influence the outcome of viral pathogenesis. Activated microglia secrete cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), which can cause toxic effects in the brain. Additionally, other soluble factors such as neurotoxins, excitatory neurotransmitters, prostaglandin, reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species are secreted by activated microglia. The causative agent Japanese encephalitis virus is an enveloped virus of the genus flavivirus and is closely related to the West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus. The positive sense single stranded RNA genome is packaged in the capsid which is formed by the capsid protein. The outer envelope is formed by envelope (E) protein and is the protective antigen. It aids in entry of the virus to the inside of the cell. Japanese Encephalitis is diagnosed by detection of antibodies in serum and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) by IgM capture ELISA. Viral antigen can also be shown in tissues by indirect fluorescent antibody staining.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: 10 days For measles, time period from exposure and development of first symptom (onset of fever) is 10 days Measles/ Rubedegla/ Morbilli It is an infection of the respiratory system caused by a virus, specifically a paramyxovirus of the genus Morbillivirus. Morbilliviruses, like other paramyxoviruses, are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a generalized, maculopapular, erythematous rash. Measles (also sometimes known as English Measles) is spread through respiration (contact with fluids from an infected person's nose and mouth, either directly or through aerosol transmission), and is highly contagious -- 90% of people without immunity sharing living space with an infected person will catch it. An asymptomatic incubation period occurs nine to twelve days from initial exposure and infectivity lasts from two to four days prior, until two to five days following the onset of the rash (i. e. four to nine days infectivity in total). An alternative name for measles in English-speaking countries is rubeola, which is sometimes confused with rubella (German measles); the diseases are unrelated The classical symptoms of measles include four-day fevers and the three Cs -- cough, coryza (head cold) and conjunctivitis (red eyes). The fever may reach up to 40 degC (104 degF). Koplik's spots seen inside the mouth are pathognomonic (diagnostic) for measles, but are not often seen, even in real cases of measles, because they are transient and may disappear within a day of arising. The characteristic measles rash is classically described as a generalized, maculopapular, erythematous rash that begins several days after the fever stas. It stas on the head before spreading to cover most of the body, often causing itching. The rash is said to \"stain\", changing color from red to dark brown, before disappearing. The measles rash appears two to four days after initial symptoms, and lasts for up to eight days. Complications Complications with measles are relatively common, ranging from relatively mild and less serious diarrhea, to pneumonia, Otitis media and acute encephalitis (and rarely subacute sclerosing panencephalitis); corneal ulceration leading to corneal scarring. Complications are usually more severe in adults who catch the virus.",

It is the weakest criteria of causal association because:? i) Most diseases are due to multiple factors with no possibility of one to one relationship, e. g., lung cancer is associated with smoking, asbestos, nickle and air pollution. ii) A single cause can give rise to more than one disease, e. g., smoking can cause, Ca lung, Bronchitis, Bladder Ca, CHD, peptic ulcer. So, o Requirement of specificity is the most difficult criteria to establish. o But lack of specificity does not negate the causal relationship because:? i) Though single cause can cause more than one disease, it may be associated in causation of disease under study, e. g., smoking is associated with so many diseases but it has been proved as the most impoant risk factor in causation of lung cancer. ii) Though most of the disease are due to multiple factor, disease under study may be associated with the risk factor under study, e. g., Lung cancer has multiple etiological risk factors, but smoking has been proved to be the most impoant risk factor. So, specificity suppo causal interpretation but lack of specificity does not negate it. Biological plausibility It implies biological credibility to the association, that is the association agrees with current understanding of the response of cells, tissues organs and system to stimuli. o For example, positive association of food intake with GI cancer is biological plausable (food enters it and causes cellular response), while positive association of food intake and skin cancer is not biological plausible.

C: Preserving traditional lifestyle Preserving traditional lifestyles is a primordial level of prevention Levels of Prevention Model This model, advocated by Leaven and Clark in 1975, has influenced both public health practice and ambulatory care delivery worldwide. This model suggests that the natural history of any disease exists on a continuum, with health at one end and advanced disease at the other. The model delineates three levels of the application of preventive measures that can be used to promote health and arrest the disease process at different points along the continuum. The goal is to maintain a healthy state and to prevent disease or injury. It has been defined in terms of four levels: Primordial prevention Prevention of the emergence or development of risk factors in population or countries in which they have not yet appeared. Effos are directed towards discouraging children from adopting harmful lifestyles. Primary prevention An action taken prior to the onset of disease, which removes the possibility that the disease will ever occur. It includes the concept of positive health, that encourages the achievement and maintenance of an \"acceptable level of health that will enable every individual to lead a socially and economically productive life. A holistic approach Secondary prevention Action which halts the progress of a disease at its incipient stage and prevents complications. The domain of clinical medicine An imperfect tool in the transmission of disease More expensive and less effective than primary prevention Teiary prevention All measures available to reduce or limit impairment and disabilities, minimize suffering caused by existing depaures from good health and to promote the patient's adjustment to irremediable conditions. Modes of intervention Health promotion Specific protection Early diagnosis and treatment Disability limitation Rehabilitation Health promotion The process of enabling people to in areas to control over and to improve health Health education Environmental modifications Nutritional interventions Lifestyle and behavioral changes Specific protection Immunization Specific nutrients Chemoprophylaxis Protection against occupational hazards Protection from carcinogens Avoidance of allergens Rehabilitation The combined and coordinated use of medical, social, educational and vocational measures for training and retraining the individual to the highest possible level of functional ability.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., 0. 7 mg/litre Principles of chlorination Water should be clear and free from turbidity. Turbidity impedes efficient chlorination. The chlorine demand of the water should be estimated. It is the amount of chlorine that is needed to destroy bacteria and to oxidize all the organic matter and ammoniacal substances present in water. Chlorine demand of water is the difference between the amount of chlorine added to the water and the amount of residual chlorine remaining at the end of specific period of contact (usually 60 minutes) at a given temperature and pH of the water. The point at which the chlorine demand of the water is met is called break point chlorination. If fuher chlorine is added beyond break point, free chlorine begins to appear in water. The presence of free residual chlorine for a contact period of at least one hour is esential to kill bacteria and virus.

Conclusion is that fat consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer. o Ecological studies are valuable because they can be done easily and quickly by using population data that has already been collecting and seeking correlations between potential risk factor and various outcomes. o Ecological studies may be more appropriate than other designs when studying the impact of an exposure on a community level. o An ecological study is normally regarded as inferior to non-ecological designs such as case-control and Coho studies because it is susceptible to ecological fallacy. o Ecological fallacy occurs when conclusion are drawn about individuals from the data that are associated with groups, as relationship observed for groups may not necessarily hold for individuals. In this question association between sale of antiarrhythmic drug and increase in death due to asthma is given for general population of `UK' (not for individuals), so it is an example of ecological study.

The simplest is the bih rate, more accurately the crude bih rate, which is the fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of bihs in a population during a given period and the denominator is the total number of person-years lived by the population during that period. The latter expression is generally approximated by the size of the population at the mid-point of the period multiplied by the length of the period in years. The rate is usually stated per 1, 000. Like other rates in which the population at the mid-point of the period is used as the denominator of the fraction this is sometimes called the central bih rate. Where the term \"bih rate\" is used without qualification, the live bih rate is generally meant and only live bihs appear in the denominator. The total bih rate based on live bihs and late foetal deaths is sometimes calculated. Legitimate bih rates and illegitimate bih rates with legitimate and illegitimate bihs respectively in the denominator are computed and the illegitimacy ratio, the number of illegitimate bihs per 1, 000 total bihs, is frequently used. These rates and ratios are generally based on live bihs. To compare the feility of different populations, standardized bih rates are often used to eliminate the effect on the bih rate of ceain differences in structure of the population (most commonly the age and sex structure). The child-woman ratio, most commonly the number of children aged 0 to 4 per 1, 000 women of childbearing age, i. e., 15 or 20 to 44 or 49, is used as an index of feility when reliable bih statistics are not available.",

Only history of risk factor exposure (smoking) is taken. Then outcome (effect on fetus) is followed in prospective. o This is classical prospective coho study. Types of coho studies Prospective coho study: Known as 'Current coho study' or 'Concurrent coho study' Outcome has not yet occurred when the study has begun: Only exposure has occurred; we look for development of same disease in both exposed and non-exposed groups Examples:- Framingham heart study, Doll & Hills prospective study on smoking & lung Cancer. Retrospective coho study: Known as 'Historical coho study' or 'Non-concurrent coho study' Combines advantages of both Coho study and Case control study Both exposure as well as outcome have occurred when the study has begun: First we go back in time and take only exposure into consideration (cohos identified from past hospital/ college records), then look for development of same disease in both exposed and non-exposed groups Sample size required is same as that of prospective coho study Usually used in occupational cancer studies Examples:- Effect of fetal monitoring on neonatal death; PVC exposure and angiosarcoma of liver. Combined prospective-retrospective coho study: Known as 'Mixed coho study' Combines designs of both prospective coho study and retrospective coho study Both exposure as well as outcome have occurred when the study has begun: First we go back in time and take only exposure into consideration (cohos identified from past hospital/ college records), then look for development of same disease in both exposed and non-exposed groups; later coho is followed prospectively into future for outcome Examples:- Cou-Brown & Doll Study on effects of radiation therapy.",

Deaths at this age are due to a peculiar set of diseases and conditions to which the adult population is less exposed or less vulnerable.

Reservoir o Any person, animal, ahropod, plant, soil or substance in which an infectious agent lives and multiplies & metabolizes. o Infectious agent is dependent on reservoir for survival. o It reproduces in reservoir in such manner that it can be transmitted to susceptible host. A reservoir acts as a source of infection when a person acquire infection directly from reservoir. So, a resrvoir may sometimes act as a source, i. e., source may be a pa of reservoir sometime (not always). Example o Source & reservoir are same --> Tetanus spores survive in soil (reservoir) and a person acquires infection directly from soil (source). So, soil acts as reservoir as well as source. o Source & reservoir different --> In typhoid, bacillus survives and multiplies inside human cases or carriers (act as reservoir), but immediate source of infection is feces or urine of patients, or contaminated food, water or milk (act as source). o So, source may or may not be a pa of reservoir. In other words reservoir may or may not act as a source. In simple words:? o Man acquires infection from source. o Infectious agent metabolizes and replicates in reservoir",

Objectives - Initial survey to identify magnitude of problem in the country; - Production and supply of iodized salt to the endemic regions; - Health Education and Publicity; - To undeake monitoring of the quality of iodized salt assessing urinary iodine excretion pattern and monitoring of Iodine Deficiency disorder; and - Re-survey in goiter endemic regions after five years continuous supply of iodized salt to assess the impact of the control programme. In 1992, the National Goiter Control Programme (NGCP) was renamed as National Iodine Deficiency Disorder Control Programme (NIDDCP). Policy On the recommendations of Central Council of Health in 1984, the Government took policy decision with the goal of \"Universal Iodization of Salt\" by 1992 and staing of Salt depament in the Ministry of Industry. Pilot Project against Micronutrient Malnutrition - Micronutrient malnutrition is a global public health problem. There is problem of iodine, iron, zinc, ad fluorine deficiency leading to many clinical manifestations in the population. - The pilot project programme against micronutrient malnutrition is being staed in the year 1995 in Assam along with four other states - Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal and Gujarat. - This project has been merged with NIDDCP. Objectives To access the magnitude of fluorosis and dental caries beside assessing the iron and Vitamin-A deficiency in the project area; To assess and improve iron and vitamin-A status in school going children, adolescent, boys and girls, non-pregnant women, adult males and geriatric population; To launch extensive information, education and communication strategy through mass media to improve the dietary habits of the populations; and To study zinc level in various food products and soil.

B: Hepatitis B Hepatitis B vaccine is a killed 'inactivated' vaccine Hepatitis B vaccine The vaccine contains one of the viral envelope proteins, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs. Ag). It is produced by yeast cells, into which the genetic code for HBs. Ag has been inseed. A course of three (3) vaccine injections are given with the second injection at least one month after the first dose and the third injection given six months after the first dose. The first vaccine became available in 1981. Presently recombinant DNA vaccines are available, which means they are produced by inseing the gene for HBV into common baker's yeast where it is grown, harvested, and purified. It is now believed that the hepatitis B vaccine provides indefinite protection. However, it was previously believed and suggested that the vaccination would only provide effective cover of between five and seven years, but subsequently it has been appreciated that long-term immunity derives from immunological memory which outlasts the loss of antibody levels and hence subsequent testing and administration of booster doses is not required in successfully vaccinated immunocompetent individuals. Hence with the passage of time and longer experience, protection has been shown for at least 25 years in those who showed an adequate initial response to the primary course of vaccinations, and guidelines now suggest that for initial responders who require ongoing protection, such as for healthcare workers, only a single booster is advocated at 5 years.",

Measurements of malaria in the pre eradication era Spleen rate: Defined as the percentage of children between 2 & 10 years of age showing enlargement of spleen. Spleen rate is widely used for measuring the endemicity of malaria in a community. Av. enlarged spleen: A refinement of spleen rate, denoting the average size of spleen. Parasite rate Defined as on the percentage of children between the ages of 2 & 10 yrs showing malarial parsites in their blood films. Parasite density index Average degree of parasitimia Infant parasite rate Percentage of infants showing malarial parasites in their blood films. It is the most sensitive index of recent transmission of malaria in a locality. If the infant parasite rate is zero for three consecutive years in a locality, it is regarded as absence of malaria transmission even though, the Anopheline vectors responsible for previous transmissions may remain. Eradication Era Annual Parasite Incidence (API)* = (Confirmed cases during one year / population under surveillance) x 1000 Annual Blood Examination Rate = (No. of slides examined/population) x 100 ABER is an index of operational efficiency.

Self care refers to those activities individuals undertake in promoting their own health, preventing their own disease, limiting their own illness, and restoring their own health. For example, measuring self BP, doing exercise, taking nutritious diet etc. 2. Community responsibility (Community participation) Health can never be adequately protected by health services without active understanding and involvement of the communities whose health is at stake. This makes community participation a very important aspect of health care. Therefore, emphasis has shifted from health care for the people to health care by the people. 3.
