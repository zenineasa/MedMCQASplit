Detects causes of voice problems, such as breathing voice, hoarse voice, weak voice, or no voice. Detects causes of throat and ear pain. Evaluates difficulty in swallowing: a persistent sensation of lump in the throat, or mucous with blood. Detects strictures or injury to the throat, or obstructive masses in the airway.
