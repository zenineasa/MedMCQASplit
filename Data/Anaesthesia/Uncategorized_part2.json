Equipment failure Disconnection Total occlusion Accidental extubation Inadequate mechanical ventilation increased (ETCO2) Bronchospasm paial - steep platen not flat capnogram (Flat capnograph is seen in severe bronchospasm). Capnography Capnography is the monitoring of the concentration or paial pressure of CO2 in the expired gases. Its main development has been as a monitoring tool for use during anaesthesia and intensive care. Capnographs usually work on the principle that CO2 absorbs infrared radiation. A beam of infrared radiation is passed across the gas sample to fall on to a sensor. The presence of CO, in the gas leads to a reduction in the amount of light falling on the sensor which changes the voltage in the circuit. A capnogram plots CO2 concentration over time and consists of four phases : The X axis measures time and the Y-axis shows the concentration of CO2. The phase I The phase I stas with exhalation. The first gases that pass over the capnography sensor usually do not contain carbon-di-oxide because they are the gases that fill the physiological dead spaces in the \"conducting airway\" (Lungs, bronchic, trachea, mouth and nose). This phase is the baseline of the capnograph. Phase II Phase II is known as the expiratory upstroke and trace steep rise in CO2 level. This phase measures a mixture of dead space (No CO2) and alveolar (CO2). Phase III This phase represents the expiratory platen which represents mostly alveolar gas exhalation. The plateu is indicative of the homeostasis of the patient. The gases released at the end of expiratory plateu have the highest concentration of CO2. This is also known as the end tidal point and is what is measured with calorimetry, capnometry or capnography. Phase IV This phase reflects the inhalational phase, which brings oxygenated gases into the lung, returning the gas levels and the capnograph waveform to the beginning of a new cycle and the baseline. Clinical applications Use of ETCO2 monitoring with intubated patients: ETCO2 monitoring is useful in gauging the severity of hypoventilation states such as drug and ethanol intoxication, diabetic ketoacidosis, congestive hea failure, stroke, head injury and/ sedation. Monitoring allows ongoing assessment of the perfusion's status, changes in ventilation status and changes in air movement as measured by ETCO2, can diagnose problems with asthma, COPD, airway edema, stroke or foreign body obstruction. Verification of Endotracheal tube placement There are several ways to evaluate the placement of an endotracheal tube which are :- auscultation of lungs for bit, breath sounds and absence of sounds in the belly, visual assessment of chest movement and clouding of endotracheal tube from the exhaled air. Displacement of the endotracheal tube Displacement of an endotracheal tube is most likely to occur when moving a patient, especially when moving the patient in or out of an ambulance or when dealing with an awake or agitated patient postoperatively. Continuous capnographic monitoring rapidly identifies the problem. The typical waveform for a displaced endotracheal tubes has the normal square like fonns that would gradually, reduce and tail off to the baseline (flat capnogratn). Adequacy of cardiopulmonary resuscitation ETCO37measurement during CPR can both assess effectiveness of the CPR and predict survivability as well. Levels of ETCO2 have predictive correlation to cardiac output. As pulmonary blood flow decreases during cardiac arrest, CO2 levels in the bloodstream are decreased which can be evaluated using a capnograph waveform. Studies have shown that without a return to ETCO2 levels of 10 mmHg or more after 20 minutes of CPR there is 100% moalio. rate. Return of spontaneous circulation ETCO2 monitoring is sensitive enough to register a rapid rise in CO2 production (indicates metabolism) well before either pulse or blood pressure is detectable. Evaluation during Asthma treatment A patient suffering bronchospasm or an asthma attack will have a characteristic \"shark fin\" waveform. This is because the bronchospasm alters the ascending phase and the platen phase with a slower rise in CO2. The effectiveness of treatment can be quickly evaluated by observation of the waveform as it returns to a more nonnal square or step shape. Severe asthma causes flat capnograph. Head injury patient Hyperventilation can increase blood pressure and with head injury patients increased blood pressure can exacerbate cerebral edema. Monitoring of ETCO2 can assist the clinician in maintaining stable CO2 levels thus avoiding secondary injury from accidental increased cerebral edema. Acute and critical care uses In addition to confirming correct Eli placements and predicting moality following cardiac arrest, capnography can play an impoant role in the critical care setting. Capnography offers a rapid alarm for ventilator disconnection, identified by a flat line on capnogram. It also assists with early identification of a dislodged tube in an awake or agitated patients.",

It is used for infiltration, nerve block, epidural and spinal anaesthesia of long duration. Epidural anaesthesia using bupivaine is very popular. Bupivacaine is drug of choice for labour analgesia. Bupivacaine is prone to prolong QTc interval and induce ventricular tachycardia or cardiac depression. So bupivacaine is contraindicated in IV regional anaesthesia. Maximum tolerable dose is 175 mg without epinephrine and 225mg with epinephrine. Commercial bupivacaine is a racemic mixture of 'R' & 'S' isomer. Levo bupivacine being 'S' isomer has less potential for toxicity and is as effective as racemic one. Bupivacaine is most potent & best agent for isobaric spinal anesthesia but cannot be used as surface (topical) anesthetic agent.Q Bupivacaine is contraindicated in regional IV anesthesia d/t fear of cardiac arrhythmiaQ. It can be used by following routes- IntrathecalQ - EpiduralQ - Peripheral nerve block All local anesthetics (LAs) bind & inhibit cardiac Na channels, but bupivacaine binds more avidly & longer than lignocaine. The bupivacaine R (+) isomer binds cardiac Na channels more avidly than S (-) isomer. This finding lead to development of levobupivacaine & ropivacaine. Inhibition of epinephrine - Stimulated CAMP formation by LAs could explain the refractoriness of bupivacaine cardiovascular toxicity to standard resuscitation measures. Programmed electrical stimulation elicit more arrythmias with bupivacaine & levobupivacaine then with lidocaine or ropivacaine. Bupivacaine is most cardiotoxic local anaesthetic, so it should not be used for Beir's block.Q It's cardiotoxicity is enhanced in pregnancy.

Spinal Anesthesia Spinal anesthesia blocks nerve roots as they course through the subarachnoid space. The spinal subarachnoid space extends from the foramen magnum to the S2 in adults and S3 in childrendeg.

Increased intra-abdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the epidural veins, thus decreasing CSF volume, are associated with higher blocksdeg.

For spinal anesthesia on a term paurient, the dosage of anesthetic can be reduced by one-third compared with a non-pregnant patientQ.

Its uses include the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, sedation for mechanically ventilated adults, and procedural sedation. Propofol is unrelated to barbiturates, and has largely replaced sodium thiopental (Pentothal) for induction of anaesthesia because recovery from propofol is more rapid and \"clear\" when compared with thiopental. Propofol is not considered an analgesic, so opioids such as fentanyl may be combined with propofol to allete pain and it is the agent of choice for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). It is used to produce sedation in ICU. It is the agent of choice for induction in susceptible individuals for malignant hypehermia.

If the inhaled Concentration of anaesthetic is high (eg N20), Substantial loss of alveolar gas volume will occur and it creates negative intralveolar pressure that leads to removal of more gas from cylinder to alveoli --> Concentration effect. If another inhalation agent is (eg Halothane) is being given at the same time, it also will be delivered to lung from the cylinder (due to negative intraalveolar pressure) --> Second gas effect. During recovery reverse occurs - N20 having low blood solubility, rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air --> paial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced. The resulting hypoxia is known as diffusion hypoxia. Diffusion hypoxia can be prevented by continuing 100% 02 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N20, instead of straight away switching over to air. Remember Concentration effect and secondary gas effect during induction. Diffusion hypoxia --> during recovering. All these occur with N20 only",

The tube in trachea can be put nose (nasotracheal), oral cavity (orotracheal) or trachea itself (tracheostomy). - Ideally tracheostomy should be performed under GA. And technically tracheostomy with an awake local anesthetic in a patient with severe airway compromise is difficult because the ideal positioning with an extended head and supine is often not tolerated by patient, and the procedure is to be undeaken in a semi upright sitting position. Because tracheostomy is a relatively time taking procedure in comparison to intubation, it does not have much role in emergency airway managementQ. Tracheostomy is usually done when immediate 02 requirements are taken care of by rapid intubation and prolonged intubation is plannedQ (>1 to 2-3 weeks). However, if intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an emergency procedure. So option D is excluded. Orotracheal intubation using rapid sequence induction is the technique of choice for resuscitationQ. And nasotracheal intubation is preferred in awake patients. But it is impoant to understand that in case of maxillary fracture, awake intubation is not possible. Nasotrached intubation is contraindica in severe mid facial injuryQ.

        "exp": "Air embolism [Ref Lee Synopsis of Anaesthesia 12rh/e p. 2741 Presence of Mill wheel murmur and decrease in End tidal CO2 during surgery suggests Air enzbolism:- \"If air enters the vein in sufficient amount, it will go to the right hea and lung causing on air-lock obstruction in the pulmonary aery. This may result in a found continuous precordial murmur, the so called \"Mill wheel murmur\". Two conditions must exist for venous air embolism to occur : - A direct communication between a source of air and the vasculature and - A pressure gradient ouring the passage of air into the circulation. Air embolism can occur whenever a blood vessel is open and a pressure gradient exists ouring entry of gas. Because the pressure in most aeries and veins is greater than atmospheric pressure an air embolus does not always happen when a blood vessel is injured. In the veins above the hea, such as in the head and neck, the pressure is less than atmospheric and an injury may let air in. This is one reason why surgeons must be paicularly careful when operating on the brain. The key factors determining the degree of morbidity and moality in venous air emboli are ? The volume of the gas entrapped. The rate of accumulation and The patient's position at the time of event. Generally small amounts of air are broken up in the capillary bed and absorbed from the circulation without producing symptoms. Traditionally it has been estimated that more than 5 ml/kg of air displaced into the intravenous space is required for significant injury (shock or cardiac arrest to occu). It a large amount of air gets lodged in the hea; it stops the flow of the blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. This results in significant rise in pulmonary aery pressures. This increase in pulmonary aery pressures can lead to right ventricular outflow obstruction and fuher compromise pulmonary venous return to the left hea. The diminished pulmonary venous return will lead to decreased left ventricular preload with resultant decreased cardiac output and eventual systemic cardiovascular collapse. In patients with patent foramen ovale the air entrapped can travel to the left side of the hea and on to the brain or coronary aeries. This can lead to most serious of air embolism symptoms. Diagnosis Dopple ultrasounddeg is the most sensitive noninvasive method to detect air embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than Doppler ultrasound but is also more invasivedeg and technically more difficult to place and to interpret. The pulmonary aery catheter is the next most sensitive monitor. Mass spectrometry.for end tidal nitrogen is as sensitive as the pulmonary aery catheter. End tidal carbon di-oxide measurement decreases during air embolism. - But decrease in ETCO2 is not specific for air embolism. Hypoventilatiorz, low cardiac output, other types of emboli and COPD can also decrease ETCO2. The least sensitive method to detect air embolism is the precordial or esophageal stethoscope. On stethoscope - \"mill wheel murmur\" is detected Clinical signs of Air embolism Abrupt fall in end tidal CO2 is usually the first sign Hypotension Tachycardia Cyanosis Mill wheel murmur Cardiovascular collapse",

Induction doses of etomidate typically produce a small increase in hea rate andl little or no decrease in blood pressure or cardiac output. Etomidate has little effect on coronary perfusion pressure while reducing myocardial O2 consumption. Hence it is best suited to maintain cardiovascular stability in patients with coronary aery disease, cardiomyopathy, cerebral vascular disease, or hypovolemia. Ref: Patel P.M., Patel H.H., Roth D.M.

        "exp": "Xenon [Ref: Morgan's Anaesthesia 4/e p 781, 166, 167; Miller's Anaesthesia p 626, 6491 Xenon seems to be the best answer because all other inhalational anaesthetics mentioned in the question produce some cardiovascular effects that may harm the patient with mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis is a disorder where cardiac output remains relatively fixed. Decrease in cardiac output should he avoided at any cost. - Any drug that increases the hea rate will reduce the cardiac output in patient with M.S. All the inhalational agents mentioned in the question decrease systemic vascular resistance and also increase the hea rate. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance leads to fall in blood pressure. Moreover, they may also decrease B.P. by their cardiodepressant action on myocardium. Therefore these drugs should not be used in patients with M.S. \"Xenon has no effects on cardiac output or cardiac rhythum and is not thought to have significant effect on systemic vascular resistance It also does not affect pulmonary function and is not known to have any renal or hepatic toxicity\". The main drawback of Xenon is its high cost and insufficient availability. -Xenon is an ine gas which is quite difficult to obtain and hence extremely expensive. - Xenon has received considerable interest in the last few years because it has many characteristics approaching those of an \"ideal\" inhaled anaesthetics. Mitral stenosis Due to mitral stenosis less blood .flows through the mitral valve to left ventricle. Left ventricle functions normally but is small and poorly.filled. Initially the left ventricle dilates keeping the pulmonary aery pressure low. As disease progresses pulmonary aery pressure increases and medial hyperophy develops resulting in chronic reactive pulmonary hypeension. The right hea hyperophies to pump against a pressure overload, then.fails. The pressure gradient across the narrow mitral orifice increase with the square of cardial output. Rapid hea rates, especially with atrial fibrillation decreases diastolic .filling time and markedly decreases cardiac output. Li / .filling is optimized by slow hea rate. Hemodynamic goals Low normal hea rate 50-70/min, treat tachycardia aggressively with /8 blockers. Maintain sinus rhythmus if possible. Maintain adequate preload Maintain high normal systemic vascular resistance Avoid hypercarbia, acidosis and hypoxia which may exacerbate pulmonary hypeension. The cardiac output is relatively fixed, maintain adequate afterload, slow the hea rate and avoid hypovolemia. Measure CVP and PAOP and maintain high preload. Avoid rapid decrease in afterload.",

In these cases emergency airway management is essential. The patient require immediate oxygen. - These patients needs to be intubated immediately. - But an impoant point to note is that severe maxillofacial trauma makes intubation very difficult. -Some believe that nasotracheal intubation is contraindicated in patients with severe maxillofacial injury because nasotracheal intubation in these patients can result in nasocranial intubation or severe nasal hemorrhage. - Nasotracheal intubation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with midfacial injury and C.S.F. rhinorrhoea. Orotracheal intubation in patients with severe maxillofacial injury In patients with severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation is also difficult. Presence of blood clots, .fractures make the passage of the tube quite difficult. Moreover when the surgeons perform operation for mandibular or maxillary fractures they wires both these together. If surgery is required with severe maxillofacial injury surgeons usually prefer nasotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Tracheostomy in patient with severe maxillofacial injury : ? Tracheostomy does not have much role in \"emergency airways management\". - Tracheostomy is a time taking procedure compared to intubation. - If the airways of the patient is severely compromised and he requires immediate oxygenation, tracheostomy has no role. - Immediate oxygenation can only be delivered by rapid intubation. In case, intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. -In emergency management of the airway, cricothyroidotomy is done if intubation is not possible. Tracheostomy is only done when immediate oxygen requirements are taken care of and a surgical procedure is planned. In the question the Sp02 of the patient is 80% when on oxygen. He requires immediate emergency management of the airway which can be achieved through intubation, If intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative.

Catheters capable of recording electrical activation in the hea are inseed the femoral vessels and manipulated under x ray guidance. Radiofrequency energy delivered a catheter is used to create small localised areas of scar. In AVN, the slow pathway is targeted with the aim of modifying conduction so that re-entrant tachycardia can no longer be sustained. Both acute and long term success rates for this procedure are high. AV is also amenable to catheter ablation. Focal atrial tachycardia can also be successfully treated with catheter ablation For re-entrant atrial tachycardias, radiofrequency ablation has high success rates and is often used as first line treatment Radiofrequency ablation is the treatment of choice for typical atrial flutter.

Epinephrine, in concentrations of 5 mcg/ml, is commonly used to decrease the absorption of local anesthetics. A 5 mcg/ml (1:200,000) dose of epinephrine will significantly reduce the peak blood levels of lidocaine and mepivacaine regardless of the site of administration. Epinephrine does not affect the vascular absorption of etidocaine and bupivacaine in the epidural space. However, the addition of epinephrine does significantly reduce the vascular absorption of etidocaine and bupivacaine when utilized for peripheral nerve blocks. Benefits of decreased absorption include increased neuronal uptake, enhanced quality of analgesia/anesthesia, prolonged duration of action, and decreased risk of toxicity.

We consider, however, that\nfurther conclusive trials are required before the manufacturer's weight-based recommendations are altered.\nJudging the correct size of LMA can be difficult since the relationship between gender, weight, height, and upper airway geometry appears inconsistent.\nNo factors have yet been identified that give an easy measurement of potential pharyngeal volume directly correlating with appropriate LMA size, and certainly, there is no known anatomical difference between the male and the female adult or child pharynx at a given weight.\nSome practitioners consider that the smaller sizes are satisfactory for spontaneous ventilation since a less effective seal is required. However, too small a mask may still result in local soft tissue damage due to poor fit around the laryngeal inlet or misplacement into the upper oesophagus or the glottic inlet.\nThe problems associated with insertion of too large a mask (airway obstruction, airway reflex activation) are probably fewer than those associated with insertion of too small a mask.",

        "exp": "The most efficient anaesthetic circuit which can used in this patient undergoing general anesthesia with spontaneous respiration is Mapelson A circuit. In Mapleson A or Magill circuit, free gas flow (FGF) enters the circuit near the reservoir bag and the APL valve is placed close to the patients face. This system is very efficient during spontaneous ventilation (SV), because the FGF needs to be only 0.7 to 1.0 times the patient's minute ventilation to avoid rebreathing. Use of this circuit is less efficient in case of rapid respiratory rate as in small children, and in controlled ventilation (CV). It should not be used in children less than 20kg because of the impoant apparatus dead space.

No consensus exists on the optimal perioperative management of patients receiving warfarin. The usual recommendation is to withhold warfarin staing 4 to 5 days preoperatively (if the INR is between 2.0 and 3.0) to allow the INR to decrease to less than 1.5, which is a level considered safe for surgical procedures and neuraxial blockade. If the INR is greater than 3.0, it is usually necessary to withhold warfarin longer than 4 to 5 days. If the INR is measured the day before the surgical procedure and remains higher than 1.8, a small dose of vitamin K (1 to 5 mg administrated orally or subcutaneously) can reverse anticoagulation. Vitamin K has an effect within 6 to 10 hours after oral or subcutaneous administration (more predictable with oral administration), and it peaks within 24 hours to 48 hours.
