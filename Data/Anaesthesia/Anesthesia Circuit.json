        "exp": "A nasal cannula is generally used wherever small amounts of supplemental oxygen are required, without rigid control of respiration, such as in oxygen therapy. Most cannulae can only provide oxygen at low flow rates--up to 5 litres per minute (L/min)--delivering an oxygen concentration of 28-44%. Rates above 5 L/min can result in discomfo to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L/min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5-6 L/min. The nasal cannula is often used in elderly patients or patients who can benefit from oxygen therapy but do not require it to self respirate. These patients do not need oxygen to the degree of wearing a non-rebreather mask. It is especially useful in those patients where vasoconstriction could negatively impact their condition, such as those suffering from strokes.",

        "exp": "Mapleson A or the Magill circuit is the circuit of choice for spontaneous ventilation. In all mapleson circuits, rebreathing of carbon dioxide is prevented by an adequate fresh gas flow and by the presence of adjustable pressure release valve. The exhaled carbon dioxide flows through the outer corrugated tube and out this valve from where it can be scavenged. Out of these, Mapleson A circuit is considered the best for spontaneous ventilation because it requires a fresh gas inflow rate of only 1 times minute ventilation to prevent rebreathing of carbon dioxide. In mapleson circuits D, E, and F, the amount of fresh gas flow required is 2.5 times a minute ventilation and in mapleson circuits B and C, it is much higher. But the disadvantage of mapleson circuit A is that it is not very useful in controlled ventilation because a minute ventilation as high as 20 L/minute (fresh gas flow rate should be greater than 3 times a minute ventilation) is needed to prevent rebreathing.",
