A fetus younger than 23 weeks has an extremely poor prognosis. Such instances of perimoem delivery are rare, and the chances of fetal survival are generally poor. The earlier the fetus is delivered following maternal arrest the better is the fetal survival. Delivery should be conducted in the mother's current location; transpoation to an operating room wastes valuable time.

It is added to local anesthetics to limit systemic absorption and the systemic side effects.

Epinephrine is also used to detect accidental intraaerial injection of a local anesthetic during the neuraxial block.

Vasopressin is not recommended for use as it has been associated with adverse outcomes in animal models. In the absence of rapid recovery following advanced life suppo measures and intravenous lipid emulsion therapy, early consideration should be given to cardiopulmonary bypass for circulatory suppo. The inotropic effect of lipid emulsion therapy only occurs once the myocardial LA levels are below a threshold that corresponds to ion channel blocking concentrations. This emphasizes the impoance of effective chest compressions to ensure coronary perfusion is sufficient to reduce LA tissue levels in order to obtain the benefit of lipid emulsion therapy. If cardiac output is maintained but there are deleterious CVS effects - such as arrhythmias, conduction block, progressive hypotension, and bradycardia - standard Advanced Cardiac Life Suppo algorithms should be followed with the omission of LA, such as lidocaine, for the treatment of arrhythmia. Amiodarone is the first-line antiarrhythmic in the event of ventricular dysrhythmia.",
