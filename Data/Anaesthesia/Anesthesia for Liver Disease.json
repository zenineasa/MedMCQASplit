MethoxyfluraneRemembero Nitric oxide is least potent inhalation agent (MAC - 105%).o Halothane is most potent inhalation agent-MAC - 0.75 (Methoxyflurane was the most potent inhalation agent hut it is not used now due to its nephrotoxic action).o Desflurane is fastest acting inhalation agent.o Diethyl ether is slowest acting (Previously it was methoxyflurane).o Ether has highest muscle relaxant action.o N2O has least muscle relaxant action.o N2O is least lipid soluble.o Halothane is most lipid soluble.o Most of the Inhaled anaesthetics are eliminated from lung, though some metabolism in liver may occur - In terms of the extent of hepatic metabolism, the rank of order is methoxyflurane > Halothane > enflurane > sevoflurane > isoflurane > desflurane > nitrous oxide.",
