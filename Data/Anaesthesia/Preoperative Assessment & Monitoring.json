Supplement analgesic action of anesthetics and potentiate them ->> Reduce the dose of anesthetic.4. Decrease secretions and vagal stimulation (undesirable reflex).5.

The oxygen content of the FRC filled with air is 21% i.e., at the end of the expiration oxygen content is 21 % in the air of lung. Normal FRC is 2.5 litres, therefore oxygen content is 500 ml (21% of 2.5 litres). Most of the remaining gas is nitrogen. This oxygen content will last only for 2 minutes (oxygen consumption is 250 ml/min).* By pre-oxygenation, we washout nitrogen (denitrogenation) with 100% O2 - O2 content of FRC is 2.5 litres (100%) - Lasts for 8 to 10 minutes.* Pre oxygenation is done for 3 minutes because 99% of denitrogenation (nitrogen wash out) takes place in 3 minutes.",
