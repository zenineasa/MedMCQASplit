        "exp": "Somatosensory evoked potential (SEP or SSEP) is the electrical activity of the brain that results from the stimulation of touch. SEP tests measure that activity and are a useful, noninvasive means of assessing somatosensory system functioning. By combining SEP recordings at different levels of the somatosensory pathways, it is possible to assess the transmission of the afferent volley from the periphery up to the coex. SEP components include a series of positive and negative deflections that can be elicited by viually any sensory stimuli. For example, SEPs can be obtained in response to a brief mechanical impact on the fingeip or to air puffs. However, SEPs are most commonly elicited by bipolar transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied on the skin over the trajectory of peripheral nerves of the upper limb (e.g., the median nerve) or lower limb (e.g., the posterior tibial nerve), and then recorded from the scalp. In general, somatosensory stimuli evoke early coical components (N25, P60, N80), generated in the contralateral primary somatosensory coex (S1), related to the processing of the physical stimulus attributes. About 100 ms after stimulus application, additional coical regions are activated, such as the secondary somatosensory coex (S2), and the posterior parietal and frontal coices, marked by a parietal P100 and bilateral frontal N140. SEPs are routinely used in neurology today to confirm and localize sensory abnormalities, to identify silent lesions and to monitor changes during surgical procedures. It is done mostly under General Anaesthesia to monitor neural pathway.",

The Oculocardiac reflex, also known as Aschner phenomenon, Aschner reflex, or Aschner-Dagnini reflex, is a decrease in pulse rate associated with traction applied to extraocular muscles and/or compression of the eyeball. The reflex is mediated by nerve connections between the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal cranial nerve the ciliary ganglion, and the vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system. Nerve fibres from the maxillary and mandibular divisionsof the trigeminal nerve have also been documented. These afferents synapse with the visceral motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, located in the reticular formation of the brain stem. The efferent poion is carried by the vagus nerve from the cardiovascular centerof the medulla to the hea, of which increased stimulation leads to decreased output of the sinoatrial node. This reflex is especially seen children, paicularly during strabismus correction surgery.However, this reflex may also occur with adults. Bradycardia,junctional rhythm and asystole, all of which may be life-threatening, can be induced through this reflex. This reflex has been seen to occur during many pan facial trauma surgeries due to stimulation of any of the three branches of trigeminal nerve.",

        "question": "Which is not a complication in surgery in sitting position?",
        "exp": "Bleeding is less when patient is placed in this position. This position is most commonly utilized for posterior fossa surgery and cervical laminectomy. Benefits: This position provides optimal surgical exposure for posterior fossa surgery because tissue retraction and risks of cranial nerve damage are reduced, cerebral venous drainage is improved and bleeding is less. The patient's airway is accessible to the anesthesiologist. Risks: Venous air embolism (VAE), paradoxical air embolism, bradycardia or cardiac arrest due to brain stem manipulations can occur. Macroglossia, upper airway obstruction, pneumocephalus, subdural hematoma, and quadriplegia have also been repoed. Despite well described risks involved with the sitting position, there is no evidence of increased moality rate. Relative contraindications to the sitting position include: open ventriculoatrial shunt, signs of cerebral ischemia when upright and awake, right-to-left shunt as with patent foramen ovale, and cardiac instability. venous air embolism in sitting craniotomy incidence highest 20-40% Hemodynamics and Ventilation. The classic sitting position causes postural hypotension in about 1/3 of patients, and 2-5% of patients suffer severe hypotension (decrease in blood pressure more than by half from baseline). The major hemodynamic consequence is decrease in venous return, leading to decrease in cardiac output and hypotension. Therefore, hemodynamic instability and cardiac disease are relative contraindications for prone positioning. Wrapping of the legs with elastic bandages (e.g. ACE bandage) prevents pooling of blood in the lower extremities and should be applied in every case. Ventilation in sitting position is improved compared to the supine position due to downward shift of the diaphragm, which decreases intraabdominal pressure, improves ventilation of the dependent zones, and decreases ventilation-perfusion mismatch. However, low perfusion pressure secondary to decreased venous return may affect oxygenation. Therefore, preventing hypovolemia and maintaining normal pulmonary perfusion pressure are crucial for maintaining an adequate oxygen delivery in sitting position. Venous Air Embolism (VAE) The mechanisms of VAE include negative venous pressure and exposure of veins and bony venous sinuses to air. When the site of surgery is exposed to air and located above the level of the hea, air may be entrained in the veins and bony venous sinuses, and air may enter the pulmonary circulation. A large VAE may decrease cardiac output by creating an airlock and decreasing left ventricular output. The incidence of VAE in sitting position may approximate 20-50% when precordial Doppler monitoring is used for detection and 76% with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is used for detection. Patent foramen ovale should be excluded before every case as it is a source of paradoxical air embolism. Therefore, preoperative \"bubble test\" in awake patients using TEE or transthoracic echocardiography is advocated by some authors if the sitting position is considered. In addition to standard monitoring, precordial transthoracic Doppler is recommended for early detection of VAE. Although TEE is more sensitive in detecting VAE, precordial Doppler is inexpensive, readily available, easy to use, and noninvasive. Optimal placement of the precordial probe should be guided by the recognizing the highest pitch over the right upper sternal border with the intravenous injection of agitated saline. When precordial Doppler or TEE are unavailable, VAE should be considered when end tidal CO2 suddenly decreases in the presence of hypotension, not explained by other causes. An atrial catheter (multiorifice or single orifice) placed at the high level of the right atrium may be helpful for air aspiration. Correct positioning may be verified using intravenous electrocardiography, chest radiography, or TEE. However, the therapeutic value of the right atrial catheter may be limited. The most impoant treatment for VAE include irrigation of the surgical site with saline, rescue head-down tilt or left lateral positioning, and cardiovascular suppo with administration of inotropes. Other Complications The incidence of postoperative pneumocephalus in sitting position may reach 100% , and may be due to negative cerebral spinal fluid pressure and/or residual air during closure of the dura. Therefore, nitrous oxide should be discontinued 20-30 minutes before completion of the procedure. However, pneumocephalus can develop even without the use of nitrous oxide and may persist for weeks after surgery. Life-threatening tension pneumocephalus is rare (3%). Quadriplegia is a rare but devastating complication and results from cervical spine ischemia with neck and head hyperflexion. Elderly patients with cervical spine deformities and vascular pathologies have higher risk. During positioning, sufficient distance between chin and neck (at least 2 finger-breadth) is recommended to avoid neck hyperflexion.",

        "exp": "Entropy monitoringis a method of assessing the effect of ceain anaesthetic drugs on the brain's EEG. It was commercially developed by Datex-Ohmeda, which is now pa of GE Healthcare. Entropy is a quantitative EEG device which captures a single-lead frontal EEG a 3-electrode sensor applied to the patient's forehead. The system relies on a method of assessing the degree of irregularity in electroencephalogram(EEG) signals. The principle is that the irregularity of an EEG signal decreases with increasing brain levels of anaesthetic drugs and that the entropy is a measure of that irregularity. Entropy monitors generate two numbers that are derived from different to frequency bands used. The State Entropy (SE) is calculated from the 0.8Hz to 32Hz range, whereas the Response Entropy (RE) uses frequencies up to 47Hz. Electromyogram activity is more predominant in those higher frequencies, and so the Response Entropy may respond more quickly when muscle activity is present. Published studies show that Entropy values do relate to clinical levels of anaesthetic depth. Most of the commonly-used anaesthetic drugs are detectable by Entropy monitoring, a notable exception being nitrous oxide, in common with BIS monitoring. Other vital signs such as pulse, hea rate, blood pressure, and movement are indirect indicators of consciousness, but are unreliable. When these are combined with expired gas analysis of inhalational anaesthetic agents, an experienced anaesthetist can be confident a patient is unconscious and not aware of their surroundings.",

        "exp": "Aschners reflex is called oculocardiac reflex. TheOculocardiac reflex, also known asAschner phenomenon, Aschner reflex, or Aschner-Dagnini reflex, is a decrease in pulse rate associated with traction applied to extraocular muscles and/or compression of the eyeball. The reflex is mediated by nerve connections between the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal cranial nerve the ciliary ganglion, and the vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system. Nerve fibres from the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve have also been documented. These afferents synapse with the visceral motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, located in the reticular formation of the brain stem. The efferent poion is carried by the vagus nerve from the cardiovascular centerof the medulla to the hea, of which increased stimulation leads to decreased output of the sinoatrial node. This reflex is especially sensitive in neonates and children, paicularly during strabismus correction surgery.However, this reflex may also occur with adults. Bradycardia, junctional rhythm and asystole all of which may be life-threatening,can be induced through this reflex. This reflex has been seen to occur during many pan facial trauma surgeries due to stimulation of any of the three branches of trigeminal nerve.",
