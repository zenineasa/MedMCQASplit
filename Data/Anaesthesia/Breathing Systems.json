A beam of infrared light is passed across the gas sample to fall on to a sensor. The presence of CO2 in the gas leads to a reduction in the amount of light falling on the sensor which changes the voltage in the circuit.Uses of CapnographyIt is the surest confirmatory sign of correct intubation in trachea.
