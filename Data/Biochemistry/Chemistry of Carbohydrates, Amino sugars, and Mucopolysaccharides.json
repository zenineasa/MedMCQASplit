        "exp": "Ans is 'd' i.e. Malonyl CoA \"Malonyl-CoA, the initial intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis formed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the fed state, is a potent inhibitor of CPT-I\"Carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT-I) is the rate limiting enzyme in the process of beta-oxidation of fatty acids.Beta-oxidation is the process by which fatty acids, in the form of Acyl-CoA molecules, are broken down in mitochondria to generate Acetyl-CoA.Under normal conditions, acetyl-CoA is further oxidized in the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) to produce energy. However, if the amounts of acetyl-CoA generated in fatty-acid b-oxidation challenge the processing capacity of the TCA cycle or if activity in the TCA cycle is low due to low amounts of intermediates such as oxaloacetate, acetyl-CoA is then used instead in biosynthesis of ketone bodies via acetoacyl-CoA and b-hydroxy-b-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG- CoA).Beta-oxidation of fatty acids is caused when there is low blood glucose levels in the blood, after exhaustion of cellular carbohydrate stores, such as glycogen. In well fed state fatty acids are esterified.The entry of fatty acids into the oxidative pathway is regulated by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I).In a well fed state the CPT-I activity is low, leading to depression of fatty acid oxidation. In state of starvation, CPT-I activity is high, leading to fatty acid oxidation.CPT-I is inhibited by Malonyl-CoA.Malonyl-CoA is the initial intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis formed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the fed state.In well fed state, free fatty acids are nearly all esterified to acylglycerols.In starvation Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is inhibited directly by acyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA decreases, releasing the inhibition of CPT-I and allowing more acyl-CoA to be beta-oxidized.Thus, beta-oxidation from free fatty acids is controlled by the CPT-I gateway into the mitochondria, and the balance of the free fatty acid uptake not oxidized is esterified.Role of Carnitine palmitoyl transferase I in fatty acid oxidation: The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to fatty acids. CPT-I helps in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria.",

For glucose in solution, more than 99% is in the pvranose form.Alpha and beta anomers:The ring structure of an aldose is a hemiacetal, since it is formed by combination of an aldehyde and an alcohol group.Similarly, the ring structure of a ketose is a hemiketal.Crystalline glucose is a-D-glucopyranose.Epimers:Isomers differing as a result of variations in configuration of the -OH and -H on carbon atoms 2, 3, and 4 of glucose are known as epimers. Biologically, the most important epimers of glucose are mannose and galactose, formed by epimerization at carbons 2 and 4, respectively.a-D-Gaiactose a-D-Glucose a-D-MannoseALdose-ketose isomerism:# Fructose has the same molecular formula as glucose but differs in its structural formula, since there is a potential keto group in position 2, the anomeric carbon of fructose , whereas there is a potential aldehyde group in position 1, the anomeric carbon of glucose.",

GLUT-4 transporters will usually not present on the membranes they will be inside the cells.After insulin binds to the receptors on the membrane of these tissues there will be translocation of these GLUT 4s to the membrane to allow entry of glucose in to the cells.

For glucose in solution, more than 99% is in the pyranose form.Alpha and beta anomers:The ring structure of an aldose is a hemiacetal, since it is formed by combination of an aldehyde and an alcohol group.Similarly, the ring structure of a ketose is a hemiketal.Crystalline glucose is a-D-glucopyranose.Epimers:Isomers differing as a result of variations in configuration of the -OH and -H on carbon atoms 2, 3, and 4 of glucose are known as epimers. Biologically, the most important epimers of glucose are mannose and galactose, formed by epimerization at carbons 2 and 4, respectively.Aldose-ketose isomerism:# Fructose has the same molecular formula as glucose but differs in its structural formula, since there is a potential keto group in position 2, the anomeric carbon of fructose , whereas there is a potential aldehyde group in position 1, the anomeric carbon of glucose.",

For example, glucose is oxidized to gluconic acid.ii) Saccharic acid:- Oxidation of aldoses with nitric acid convert both aldehyde and terminal primary alcohol groups to carboxyl group, formic saccharic acid. For example, glucose is oxidize to glucosaccharic acid.iii) Uronic acid:- When an aldose is oxidized in such a way that the terminal primary alcohol is converted is to carboxyl without oxidation of aldehyde group, a uronic acid is produce.
