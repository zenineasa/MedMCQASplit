        "question": "Per TCA with 3 NADH and 1 FADH2, generates how many ATP-",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., 9 o One N ADH produces 2.5 ATP and one FADH2 produces 1.5 ATP. Thus 3 NADH and 1 FADH2 will produce 9 ATP.o There is production of ATP at substrate level also. Thus total 10 ATP molecules are produced per cycle.Energetics of TCA cycles iKreb's cycle)o One turn of the TCA cycle, starting with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the starting molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2[?]5 ATPs and therefore, 12[?]5 ATPs are produced when starting compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle,o Note : Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from starting. Recent experiments shoiv that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2[?]5 ATPs and FADH produces T5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.o Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per moleeule of glucose wrhen it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows :- Method ofATP formationNo of ATPs gained perglucose (new calculation)No of ATPs As per old calculationPathwayStepEnzymeSource Glycolysis1 Hexokinase.Minus 1Minus 1Do3Pbosphofructoki nase-Minus 1Minus 1Do5Glyceraldehyde-3-p DHNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2 = 53x2=6Do61,3-BPG kinaseATPSubstrate level1x2= 21x2=2Do9Pyruvate kinaseATPSubstrate level1x2= 21x2=2Pyruvate to-PyruvateNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2= 53x2=6Acetyl CoA Dehydrogenase TCA cycle3Isocitrate DHNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2= 53x2=6Do4Alpha keto giutarate DHNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2= 53x2=6Do5Succinate thiokinaseGTPSubstrate level1x2= 21x2=2Do6Succictnate DHFADH2Respiratory chain1-5x2= 32x2=4Do8Malate DHNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2= 53 x 2= 6Net generation in glycolytic pathway 9 minus 2=710 minus 2=8Generation in pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction=5 =6Generation in citric acid cycle=20 =24Net generation of ATP from one glucose mole=32 =38",

        "exp": "ANSWER: (D) Succinate thiokinaseREF: Murray pp 130-135, Scriver, pp 1521-1552, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substratelevel_ phosphorylationSubstrate-level phosphorylation is a type of metabolism that results in the formation and creation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by the direct transfer and donation of a phosphoryl (PO3) group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or guanosine diphosphate (GDP) from a phosphorylated reactive intermediate. Note that the phosphate group does not have to directly come from the substrate. By convention, the phosphoryl group that is transferred is referred to as a phosphate group.Once the pyruvate product of glycolysis is moved to the mitochondrial matrix, the pyruvate is converted to acetate and binds Coenzyme A to form Acetyl CoA to enter the Krebs cycle. While the Krebs cycle is oxidative respiration, one more instance of substrate-level phosphorylation occurs as Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is created from GDP by transfer of a phosphate group during the conversion of Succinyl CoA to Succinate. This phosphate is transferred to ADP in another substrate-level phosphorylation event. The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme Succinyl- CoA synthetase.A molecule of guanosine triphosphate is synthesized from guanosine diphosphate and phosphate at the cost of hydrolyzing succinyl-CoA to succinate and CoA. This constitutes substrate-level phosphorylation, and, in contrast to oxidative phosphorylation, this is the only reaction in the citric acid cycle that directly yields a high-energy phosphate bond. The sequence of reactions from a ketoglutarate to succinate is catalyzed by the a ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and succinyl-CoA synthetase, respectively. Succinate thiokinase is the only enzyme that generates ATP directly by substrate-level phosphorylation.a ketoglutarate + NAD+ + acetyl-CoA - succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADHsuccinyl-CoA + Pi + GDP - succinate + GTP + acetyl-CoA",
