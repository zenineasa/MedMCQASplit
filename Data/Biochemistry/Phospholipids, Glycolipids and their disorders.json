They are commonly referred to as glycosphingo lipids because presence of sphingosine backbone (within ceramide).o Depending on the nature of carbohydrate component attached, four types of glycosphingolipids are recognized: Cerebrosides, Sulfatids, globosides and gangliosides1) Cerebrosides (Ceramide + monosaccharide):-# Cerebrosides are the simplest + glycolipids in which a monosaccharide is attached to ceramide.# The monosaccharide is commonly either glucose (glucocerebroside) or galactose (galactocerebroside).# Galactocerebroside is the most common cerebroside found in nerve tissue membrane, whereas glucocerebroside is the predominant glycolipid in extraneural tissues, where it serves as a precursor for synthesis of more complex glycolipids, e.g. gangliosides.2) Sulfatides:-# Sulfatides are are cerebrosides in which the monosaccharide (mostly galactose) contains a sulfate ester.3) Globosides (Ceramide + oligosaccharide):-# They contain two or more sugars (oligosaccharide chain) attached to ceramide.4) Gangliosides (Cerebroside + oligosaccharides + N-acetylneuromic acid NANA):-# Gangliosides are complex glycolipids, derived from glucocerebroside.# Ganglioside contain oligosaccharides and one or more molecules of sialic acid which is usually N-acetyl neuramic acid (NANA) attached to ceramide.# Several types of gangliosides such as GM1, GM2, GM3 etc have been isolated from brain and other tissues.",
