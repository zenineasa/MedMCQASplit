        "exp": "=Diabetic situation is same like fasting or starvation i.e. catabolic situation in the body. =There is relative or absolute deficiency of insulin. =This leads to increased Glucagon, increased cAMP & increased Blood Glucose. Insulin dependent GLUT-4 is not working in Diabetes, so blood glucose cannot enter peripheral tissues. Plasma free fatty acid levels will be raised as catabolic enzyme - Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL) will be active in adipose tissues, which breaks down TGs into fatty acid & glycerol. Fatty acids travel to blood and liver, where beta oxidation of fatty acids takes place. In a chronic diabetes patient, plasma TG and VLDL will also be raised. Pathways which are activated in diabetes are : Beta oxidation of fatty acids Gluconeogenesis Ketone body synthesis Lipolysis of adipose tissues",

But there is only one enzyme in Adipose tissues for the synthesis of Glycerol-3-P and that is Glycerol-3-P Dehydrogenase which synthesize Glycerol-3-P from DHAP. This DHAP is derived from Glucose. So Glucose entry is must in Adipose tissues for TG synthesis. This occurs with the help of glucose channel - GLUT-4. In liver, there are two enzymes for TG synthesis : 1.
