        "exp": "Glycogen Synthase is enzyme of Glycogen Synthesis, which is an Anabolic pathway. So this enzyme is active in Dephosphorylated state. Rest all enzymes are involved in Catabolic pathways, so they are active in Phosphorylated state. Pyruvate Carboxylase is involved in Gluconeogenesis, which is a Catabolic pathway. Glycogen Phosphorylase is involved in Glycogenolysis, which is a Catabolic pathway. PEPCK- Phospho Enol Pyruvate Carboxy Kinase, is also involved in Gluconeogenesis, which is a Catabolic pathway.
