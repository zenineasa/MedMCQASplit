Ferritin is an acute phase reactant protein that is elevated in inflammatory diseases. Estimation of ferritin is also indicated in chronic kidney disease to assess the extent of anemia. v. Synthesis of TfR and ferritin and that of ferritin are reciprocally controlled. Both are controlled by the iron content. When iron levels are high, ferritin is synthesized to store the iron; but the TfR synthesis is blocked. When iron levels are high, iron binds to iron-response-element- binding-protein (IREBP), preventing it from binding to IRE. This will result in synthesis of new ferritin, and suppression of synthesis of TfR. Transferrin receptors (TfR) are present on most of the body cells, especially on cells which synthesize heme. The iron-transferrin complex is taken up by the body cells by the receptor mechanism. The transferrin receptor has a molecular weight of 200 kD. It binds two molecules of transferrin. The iron-transferrin- receptor is internalized. Iron is taken in by the cells, and receptor molecules are externalized. vii. Transferrin is a glycoprotein.

Avoiding sunlight and using sunscreen ointment will be beneficial. Patients with XP have a 1000-fold greater chance of developing skin cancer than do normal persons.
