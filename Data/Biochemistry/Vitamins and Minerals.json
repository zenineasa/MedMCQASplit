        "question": "Which dietary deficiency of a vitamin can cause Pellagra.",
        "exp": "Some amino acids (isoleucine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) are both glucogenic and ketogenic because their degradation pathway forms multiple products.a. Amino acids that are converted to pyruvate (see Figure I).(1). The amino acids that are synthesized from the intermediates of glycolysis (serine, glycine, cysteine, and alanine) are degraded to form pyruvate.(a). Serine is converted to 2-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate of glycolysis, or directly to pyruvate and NH4+ by serine dehydratase, an enzyme that requires PLP.(b). Glycine, in a reversal of the reaction utilized for its synthesis, reacts with methylene-FH4 to form serine.1. Glycine also reacts with FH4 and NAD+ to produce CO2 and NH4+ (glycine cleavage enzyme).2. Glycine can be converted to glyoxylate, which can be oxidized to CO2 and H2 O or converted to oxalate.(c). Cysteine forms pyruvate. Its sulfur, which was derived from methionine, is converted to H2 SO4 , which is excreted by the kidneys.(d). Alanine can be transaminated to pyruvate.b. Amino acids that are converted to intermediates of the TCA cycle (see Figure II).(1). The carbons from the four groups of amino acids form the TCA cycle intermediates: a-ketoglutarate, succinyl-CoA, fumarate, and oxaloacetate.(a). Amino acids that form a-ketoglutarate (see Figure III).1. Glutamate can be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminated to form a- ketoglutarate.2. Glutamine is converted by glutaminase to glutamate with the release of its amide nitrogen as NH4+ 3. Proline is oxidized so that its ring opens, forming glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to glutamate.4. Arginine is cleaved by arginase in the liver to form urea and ornithine. Ornithine is transaminated to glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to glutamate.5. Histidine is converted to formiminoglutamate (FIGLU). The formimino group is transferred to FH4, and the remaining five carbons form glutamate.(b). Amino acids that form succinyl-CoA (see Figure IV)1. Four amino acids are converted to propionyl-CoA, which is carboxylated in a biotin requiring reaction to form methylmalonyl-CoA, which is rearranged to form succinyl-CoA in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 (seen previously in the metabolism of odd-chain number fatty acids).a). Threonine is converted by a dehydratase to NH4+ and a-ketobutyrate, which is oxidatively decarboxylated to propionyl-CoA.In a different set of reactions, threonine is converted to glycine and acetyl-CoA.b). Methionine provides methyl groups for the synthesis of various compounds; its sulfur is incorporated into cysteine; and the remaining carbons form succinyl-CoA.i. Methionine and ATP form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which donates a methyl group and forms homocysteine.ii. Homocysteine is reconverted to methionine by accepting a methyl group from the FH4 pool via vitamin B12 .iii. Homocysteine can also react with serine to form cystathionine. The cleavage of cystathionine produces cysteine, NH4+ , and a-ketobutyrate, which is converted to propionyl-CoA.c). Valine and isoleucine, two of the three branched-chain amino acids, form succinyl-CoA (see Figure IV).i. The degradation of all the three branched-chain amino acids begins with a transamination followed by an oxidative decarboxylation catalysed by the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (Figure V). This enzyme, like pyruvate dehydrogenase and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, requires thiamine pyrophosphate, lipoic acid, CoA, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and NAD+.ii. Valine is eventually converted to succinyl-CoA via propionyl-CoA and methyl malonyl-CoA.iii. Isoleucine also forms succinyl-CoA after two of its carbons are released as acetyl-CoA.(c). Amino acids that form fumarate1. Three amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and aspartate) are converted to fumarate (see Figure II).a). Phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase in a reaction requiring tetrahydrobiopterin and O2 (Figure VI).b). Tyrosine, obtained from the diet or by hydroxylation of phenylalanine, is converted to homogentisic acid. The aromatic ring is opened and cleaved, forming fumarate and acetoacetate.c). Aspartate is converted to fumarate via reactions of the urea cycle and the purine nucleotide cycle.d). Aspartate reacts with IMP to form AMP and fumarate in the purine nucleotide cycle.(d). Amino acids that form oxaloacetate (see Figure II)1. Aspartate is transaminated to form oxaloacetate.2. Asparagine loses its amide nitrogen as NH4+ , forming aspartate in a reaction catalyzed by asparaginase.c. Amino acids that are converted to acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate (see Figure VI).(1). Four amino acids (lysine, threonine, isoleucine, and tryptophan) can form acetyl-CoA, and phenylalanine and tyrosine form acetoacetate. Leucine is degraded to form both acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate.Pellagra is caused by a dietary deficiency of niacin, beriberi is caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B-,), scurvy caused by a lack of vitamin C, and rickets from a lack of vitamin D.I. Amino acids derived from the intermediates of glycolysis. These amino acids can be synthesized from glucose and can be reconverted to glucose in the liver.II. The degradation of amino acids. A. Amino acids that produce pyruvate or the intermediates of the TCA cycle. These amino acids are considered glucogenic because their carbons can produce glucose in the liver. B. Amino acids that produce acetyl-CoA or ketone bodies. These amino acids are considered ketogenic. CoA, coenzyme A; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.III. Amino acids related through glutamate. These amino acids contain carbons that can be converted to glutamate, which can be converted to glucose in the liver. All of these amino acids except histidine can be synthesized from glucose.IV. Amino acids that can be converted to succinyl-CoA. The amino acids methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and valine, which form succinyl-CoA via methyl malonyl-CoA, are all essential. Because succinyl-CoA can form glucose, these amino acids are glucogenic. The carbons of serine are converted to cysteine and do not form succinyl-CoA by this pathway. A defect in cystathionine synthase causes homocystinuria. A defect in cystathionase causes cystathioninuria. B12-CH3, methyl cobalamin; N5-CH3-FH4, N 5- methyl tetrahydrofolate; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.V. The degradation of the branched-chain amino acids. Valine forms propionyl-CoA. Isoleucine forms propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Leucine forms acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA. CoA, coenzyme A; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA.VI. A. Ketogenic amino acids. Some of these amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) also contain carbons that can form glucose. Leucine and lysine are strictly ketogenic; they do not form glucose. B. A deficiency in various steps leads to the diseases indicated. CoA, coenzyme A; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; PKU, phenylketonuria; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.",

        "exp": "Functions of vitamin B12 a. Vitamin B12 contains cobalt in a corrin ring that resembles a porphyrin.(1). Vitamin B12 is the cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which catalyzes the rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (see Fig below).(a). This reaction is involved in the production of succinyl-CoA from valine, isoleucine, threonine, methionine, and the propionyl-CoA formed by the oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of carbons.(2). Vitamin B12 is involved in the transfer of methyl groups from FH4 to homocysteine to form methionine (see Figure below).A vitamin B12 deficiency results in a megaloblastic anemia plus demyelination of nerves, because of reduced levels of SAM in the nervous system. These cells are large because the vitamin deficiency interferes with DNA synthesis, and the cells double in size without being able to replicate their DNA. Once the anemia begins, the large blast cells are released by the marrow in an attempt to control the anemia. A hypochromic, microcytic anemia can result from the lack of iron, or lack of pyridoxal phosphate. Both conditions lead to a reduction in the synthesis of heme, so the red cells cannot carry as much oxygen (which gives them the pale color). The cells are small in order to maximize the concentration of hemoglobin present in the cells. Hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane fragments, which can occur with pyruvate kinase deficiencies or a lack of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (which results in reduced NADPH levels). Sickle cell anemia is caused by a point mutation in the b-globin gene, substituting a valine for a glutamic acid.The transfer of a 1-carbon unit from serine to deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to form deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). FH4 is oxidized to FH2 in this reaction. FH2 is reduced to FH4 by dihydrofolate reductase. The rectangles indicate the steps at which the antimetabolites methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil act.

        "question": "The active form of vitamin A is:",
        "exp": "Ans. B. Retinol. (Ref. Harper's Biochem 27th/Ch. 44; Harrison 18th/Ch. 74; Robbin's fig.9-22).Vitamin A, in the strictest sense, refers to retinol. However, the oxidized metabolites, retinaldehyde and retinoic acid, are also biologically active compounds. The term retinoids includes all molecules (including synthetic molecules) that are chemically related to retinol. Retinaldehyde (11-cis) is essential form of vit A that is required for normal vision, whereas retinoic acid is necessary for morphogenesis, growth, and cell differentiation. Retinoic acid does not function in vision and, in contrast to retinol, is not involved in reproduction. Vitamin A also plays a role in iron utilization, humoral immunity, T cell-mediated immunity, NK cell activity, and phagocytosis. Vitamin A is commercially available in esterified forms (e.g., acetate, palmitate) since it is more stable as an ester.Retinol, perhaps the most important form of vitamin A, is the transport form and, as the retinol ester, also the storage form. It is oxidized in vivo to the aldehyde retinal (the form used in visual pigment) and the acid retinoic acid. Important dietary sources of vitamin A are animal derived (e.g., liver, fish, eggs, milk, butter). Yellow and leafy green vegetables such as carrots, squash, and spinach supply large amounts of carotenoids, many of which are provitamins that can be metabolized to active vitamin A in vivo; the most important of these is beta-carotene. Retinoids, refers to both natural and synthetic chemicals that are structurally related to vitamin A but do not necessarily have vitamin A activity.As with all fats, the digestion and absorption of carotenes and retinoids require bile, pancreatic enzymes, and some level of antioxidant activity in the food. Retinol, whether derived from ingested esters or from beta-carotene (through an intermediate oxidation step involving retinal), is transported in chylomicrons to the liver for esterification and storage. More than 90% of the body's vitamin A reserves are stored in the liver, predominantly in the perisinusoidal stellate (Ito) cells. In normal persons who consume an adequate diet, these reserves are sufficient for at least 6 months' deprivation. Retinoic acid, on the other hand, can be absorbed unchanged; it represents a small fraction of vitamin A in the blood and is active in epithelial differentiation and growth but not in the maintenance of vision.In the retina, retinaldehyde functions as the prosthetic group of the light-sensitive opsin proteins, forming rhodopsin (in rods) and iodopsin (in cones). Any one cone cell contains only one type of opsin, and is sensitive to only one color. In the pigment epithelium of the retina, all-trans-retinol is isomerized to 11-cis-retinol and oxidized to 11-cis-retinaldehyde. This reacts with a lysine residue in opsin, forming the holoprotein rhodopsin. The absorption of light by rhodopsin causes isomerization of the retinaldehyde from 11-cis to all-trans, and a conformational change in opsin. This results in the release of retinaldehyde from the protein, and the initiation of a nerve impulse. The formation of the initial excited form of rhodopsin, bathorhodopsin, occurs within picoseconds of illumination. There is then a series of conformational changes leading to the formation of metarhodopsin II, which initiates a guanine nucleotide amplification cascade and then a nerve impulse. The final step is hydrolysis to release all-trans-retinaldehyde and opsin. The key to initiation of the visual cycle is the availability of 11-cis-retinaldehyde, and hence vitamin A. In deficiency, both the time taken to adapt to darkness and the ability to see in poor light are impaired.VitaminsVitaminActive derivative or co-factor formClinical FindingDietary Level per Day Asso with Overt Deficiency in AdultsContributing Factors to DeficiencyThiamineThiamine pyrophosphateBeriberi; neuropathy, muscle weak- ness and wasting, cardiomegaly, edema, ophthalmoplegia, confabulation<0.3 mg/1000 kcalAlcoholism, chronic diuretic use, hyperemesisRiboflavinFMN and FADMagenta tongue, angular stomatitis, seborrhea, cheilosis<0.6 mg--NiacinNADp and NADPellagra: pigmented rash of sun- exposed areas, bright red tongue, diarrhea, apathy, memory loss, disorientation<9.0 niacin equivalentsAlcoholism, vitamin B6 deficiency, riboflavin deficiency, tryptophan deficiencyVitamin B6Pyridoxal phosphateSeborrhea, glossitis, convulsions, neuropathy, depression, confusion, microcytic anemia<0.2 mgAlcoholism, isoniazidFolatePolyglutamte forms of trtrahydrofolate with C-unitMegaloblastic anemia, atrophic glossitis, depression, homocysteine<100 mcg/dAlcoholism, sulfasalazine, pyrimethamine, triamtereneVitamin B12Methylcobalamine AdenosylcobalaminMegaloblastic anemia, loss of vibratory and position sense, abnormal gait, dementia, impotence, loss of bladder and bowel control, homocysteine, methylmalonic acid<1.0 mcg/dGastric atrophy (pernicious anemia), terminal ileal disease, strict vegetarianism, acid-reducing drugs (e.g., H2 blockers)Vitamin CAscorobic acid and dehydroascorbic acidScurvy: petechiae, ecchymosis, coiled hairs, inflamed and bleeding gums, joint effusion, poor wound healing, fatigue<10 mg/dSmoking, alcoholismVitamin ARetinol, retinal- dehyde, and retinoic acidXerophthalmia, night blindness,Bitot's spots, follicular hyperkeratosis, impaired embryonic development, immune dysfunction<300 mcg/dFat malabsorption, infection, measles, alcoholism, protein- energy malnutritionVitamin D1,25-Dihydroxy- vitamin DRickets: skeletal deformation, rachitic rosary, bowed legs; osteomalacia<2.0 mcg/dAging, lack of sunlight exposure, fat malabsorption, deeply pigmented skinVitamin ETocopherols and tocotrienolsPeripheral neuropathy, spinocere- bellar ataxia, skeletal muscle atrophy, retinopathyNot described unless underlying contributing factor is presentOccurs only with fat malabsorption or genetic abnormalities of vitamin E metabolism/ transportVitamin KVitamin K hydroquinone useElevated prothrombin time, bleeding<10 mcg/dFat malabsorption, liver disease, antibiotic",

        "exp": "Ans. A. CretinismCretinism is a condition of severely stunted physical and mental growth owing to untreated congenital deficiency of thyroid hormone (congenital hypothyroidism) usually owing to maternal hypothyroidism.PathophysiologyCongenital hypothyroidism can be endemic, genetic, or sporadic. If untreated, it results in mild to severe impairment of both physical and mental growth and development.Poor length growth is apparent as early as the first year of life. Adult stature without treatment ranges from 100 to 160 cm (3 ft 3 in to 5 ft 3 in), depending on severity, sex, and other genetic factors. In adults, Cretinism results in mental deterioration, swelling of the skin, loss of water and hair. Bone maturation and puberty are severely delayed. Ovulation is impeded and infertility is common.Neurological impairment may be mild, with reduced muscle tone and coordination, or so severe that the person cannot stand or walk. Cognitive impairment may also range from mild to so severe that the person is nonverbal and dependent on others for basic care. Thought and reflexes are slower.Other signs may include thickened skin, enlarged tongue, or a protruding abdomen.Dwarfism may also be caused by malnutrition or other hormonal deficiencies, such as insufficient growth hormone secretion, hypopituitarism, decreased secretion of growth hormone-releasing hormone, deficient growth hormone receptor activity and downstream causes, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) deficiency.TreatmentSporadic and genetic cretinism results from abnormal development or growth of the foetal thyroid gland. This type of cretinism has been almost completely eliminated in developed countries by early diagnosis by newborn screening schemes followed by lifelong treatment with thyroxine (T4).Thyroxine must be dosed as tablets only, even to newborns, as the liquid oral suspensions and compound forms cannot be dependent on for reliable dosing. In the case of dosing infants, the T4 tablets are generally crushed and mixed with breast milk, formula milk or water. If the medication is mixed with formulas containing iron or soya products, larger doses may be required, as these substances may alter the absorption of thyroid hormone from the gut. Frequent monitoring (every 2-3 weeks during the first months of life) is recommended to ensure that infants with congenital hypothyroidism remain within the high end of normal range or euthyroid.",

Purines are required for DNA and RNA synthesis.(2). dUMP forms dTMP by accepting a 1-carbon group from FH4 (Figure II). This reaction produces the thymine required for DNA synthesis.(a). The methylene group is reduced to a methyl group in this reaction, and FH4 is oxidized to FH2 .(b). FH2 is reduced to FH4 in the NADPH-requiring reaction catalyzed by FH2 reductase.(3). Glycine obtains a 1-carbon group from FH4 to form serine.(4). Vitamin B12 obtains a methyl group from 5-methyl-FH4 . The methyl group is transferred from methyl-B12 to homocysteine to form methionine (see Figure III, reaction 8). This is the only fate of 5-methyl-FH4 .Folate deficiency results in a megaloblastic anemia because of decreased production of purines and the pyrimidine thymine. Thus, lack of folate causes decreased DNA synthesis. In contrast with a vitamin B12 deficiency, neurologic problems do not occur in a folate deficiency. A hypochromic, microcytic anemia can result from the lack of iron, or lack of pyridoxal phosphate. Both conditions lead to a reduction in the synthesis of heme, so the red cells cannot carry as much oxygen (which gives them the pale color). The cells are small in order to maximize the concentration of hemoglobin present in the cells. Hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane fragments, which can occur with pyruvate kinase deficiencies or a lack of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (which results in reduced NADPH levels).

Commercially available retinoid derivatives are also toxic, including 13-cis-retinoic acid, which has been associated with birth defects. As a result, contraception should be continued for a least 1 year, and possibly longer, in women who have taken 13-cis retinoic acid.Vitamin A# In the strictest sense, refers to retinol.# However, the oxidized metabolites, retinaldehyde and retinoic acid, are also biologically active compounds. The term retinoids includes all molecules (including synthetic molecules) that are chemically related to retinol.# Retinaldehyde (11-cis) is the essential form of vitamin A that is required for normal vision, whereas retinoic acid is necessary for normal morphogenesis, growth, and cell differentiation. Retinoic acid does not function in vision and, in contrast to retinol, is not involved in reproduction.# Vitamin A also plays a role in iron utilization, humoral immunity, T cell-mediated immunity, natural killer cell activity, and phagocytosis. Vitamin A is commercially available in esterified forms (e.g., acetate, palmitate) since it is more stable as an ester.# ?-Carotene is the most prevalent carotenoid in the food supply that has provitamin A activity. It is now estimated that 12 ?g or greater of dietary ?-carotene is equivalent to 1 ?g of retinol, whereas 24 ?g or greater of other dietary provitamin A carotenoids (e.g., cryptoxanthin, ?-carotene) is equivalent to 1 ?g of retinol.# Retinoic acid is a ligand for certain nuclear receptors that act as transcription factors. Two families of receptors (RAR and RXR receptors) are active in retinoid-mediated gene transcription.# Vitamin A is needed to form the visual pigments and, therefore, to prevent night blindness.# Vitamin A is also necessary for normal growth of most cells of the body and especially for normal growth and proliferation of the different types of epithelial cells. When vitamin A is lacking, the epithelial structures of the body tend to become stratified and keratinized.# Vitamin A deficiency manifests itself bx:(1) scaliness of the skin and sometimes acne;(2) failure of growth of young animals, including cessation of skeletal growth;(3) failure of reproduction, associated especially with atrophy of the germinal epithelium of the testes and sometimes with interruption of the female sexual cycle; and(4) keratinization of the cornea, with resultant corneal opacity and blindness.# In vitamin A deficiency, the damaged epithelial structures often become infected, for example, the conjunctivae of the eyes, the linings of the urinary tract, and the respiratory passages. Vitamin A has been called an \"anti-infection\" vitamin.# Toxicity# Acute toxicity of vitamin A was first noted in Arctic explorers who ate polar bear liver and has also been seen after administration of 150 mg in adults or 100 mg in children.# Acute toxicity is manifested by increased intracranial pressure, vertigo, diplopia, bulging fontanels in children, seizures, and exfoliative dermatitis; it may result in death. In children being treated for vitamin A deficiency according to the protocols outlined above, transient bulging of fontanels occurs in 2% of infants, and transient nausea, vomiting, and headache occur in 5% of preschoolers.# Chronic vitamin A intoxication is largely a concern in industrialized countries and has been seen in normal adults who ingest 15 mg/d and children who ingest 6 mg/d of vitamin A over a period of several months. Manifestations include dry skin, cheilosis, glossitis, vomiting, alopecia, bone demineralization and pain, hypercalcemia, lymph node enlargement, hyperlipidemia, amenorrhea, and features of pseudotumor cerebri with increased intracranial pressure and papilledema. Liver fibrosis with portal hypertension and bone demineralization may result from chronic vitamin A intoxication. When vitamin A is provided in excess to pregnant women, congenital mal- formations have included spontaneous abortions, craniofacial abnormalities, and valvular heart disease.# High doses of carotenoids do not result in toxic symptoms but should be avoided in smokers due to an increased risk of lung cancer. Carotenemia, which is characterized by a yellowing of the skin (creases of the palms and soles) but not the sclerae, may be present after ingestion of >30 mg of ?-carotene daily. Hypothyroid patients are particularly susceptible to the development of carotenemia due to impaired breakdown of carotene to vitamin A. Reduction of carotenes from the diet results in the disappearance of skin yellowing and carotenemia over a period of 30-60 days.Human teratogenic drugsDrugAbnormalityThalidomidePhocomelia, Multiple defectsAnticancer drugs (methotrexate)Cleft palate, hydrocephalus, multiple defects, foetal deathAndrogensVirilization; limb, esophageal, cardiac defectsProgestinsVirilization of female foetusStiboestrolVaginal carcinoma in teenage female offspringTetracyclinesDiscoloured and deformed teeth, retarded bone growthWarfarinDepressed nose; eye and hand defects, growth retardationPhenytoinHypoplastic phalanges, sleft lip/palate, microcephalyPheenobarbitoneVariousmalformationsCarbamazepineNeural tube defects, other abnormalitiesValproate sodSpina bifida and other neural tube defectsAlcoholLow IQ baby, growth retardation, foetal alcohol syndromeACE inhibitorsHypoplasia of organs, growth retardation, foetal lossLithiumFoetal goiter, cardiac and other abnormalitiesAntithyroid drugsFoetal goiter and hypothyroidismIndomethacin/aspirinPremature closure of ductus arteriosusIsotretinoinCraniofacial, heart and CNS defects.",

        "question": "A deficiency of substance Intrinsic factor can result in an anemia. Choose the type of anemia that would occur if the substance were deficient.",
        "exp": "We will illustrate, in addition, how biochemical measurements can pinpoint a disorder and allow one to determine which enzyme is functioning improperly.a. Mouth(1). Salivary glands produce a-amylase, which cleaves a-1,4 bonds between glucose residues in dietary starch. (Pancreatic a-amylase catalyzes the same reaction.)b. Stomach(1). Chief cells produce the proteolytic enzyme pepsin, as its inactive precursor pepsinogen. Pepsin digests proteins.(2). Parietal cells produce hydrochloric acid (HCl) and intrinsic factor.(a). HCl causes pepsinogen (the precursor of pepsin) to cleave itself (autocatalysis), producing pepsin.(b). Intrinsic factor binds dietary vitamin B12 and aids in its absorption.(c). Vitamin B12 is the cofactor for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine and methyl malonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoAc. Gallbladder(1). Bile salts, synthesized in the liver from cholesterol, pass through the gallbladder into the intestine, where they aid in lipid digestion.(2). Bilirubin diglucuronide, produced in the liver from bilirubin (the excretory product of heme degradation), passes through the gallbladder into the intestine.d. Pancreas(1). The pancreas produces bicarbonate (HCO3- ), which neutralizes stomach acid as it enters the intestinal lumen. The subsequent increase in pH in the lumen allows more extensive ionization of bile salts (so they serve as better detergents) and increases the activity of digestive enzymes.(2). The pancreas produces digestive enzymes (e.g., trypsin, chymotrypsin, the carboxypeptidases, elastase, a-amylase, lipase).(3). The B (or b) cells of the endocrine pancreas produce insulin (the hormone that stimulates the storage of fuels in the fed state) and the A (or a) cells produce glucagon (the hormone that stimulates the release of stored fuels during fasting).e. Intestine(1). The enzymes from the exocrine pancreas digest food in the intestinal lumen.(2). The intestinal digestive enzymes are bound to the brush borders of intestinal epithelial cells (aminopeptidases, dipeptidases and tripeptidases, lactase, sucrase, maltases, and isomaltases).(3). The absorption of digestive products occurs through the intestinal epithelial cells.(4). The intestinal epithelial cells produce chylomicrons from the digestive products of dietary fat (fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerols) and secrete the chylomicrons into the lymph.(5). Most bile salts are resorbed in the ileum and recycled by the liver. Only 5% are excreted in the feces. This excretion of bile salts, along with cholesterol secreted by the liver into the gut via the gallbladder, is the major means by which the body disposes of the cholesterol ring structure (sterol nucleus).f. Liver (the enzymic regulation of liver function is summarized in Tables below)(1). Functions of the liver include:(a). Storage of glycogen produced from dietary carbohydrate.(b). Synthesis of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), mainly from dietary carbohydrate.(c). Production of high-density lipoprotein, which transfers CII and E apolipoproteins to chylomicrons and VLDL, converts cholesterol to cholesterol esters (via the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase reaction), and reduces blood by which cholesterol and cholesterol esters are transported from tissues to the liver (reverse cholesterol transport).(d). Maintenance of blood glucose levels during fasting via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.(e). Production of urea from nitrogen derived, in part, from amino acids because they are being converted to glucose (via gluconeogenesis) during fasting.(f). Production of ketone bodies from fatty acids derived from lipolysis of adipose triacylglycerols during fasting.(g). Synthesis of cholesterol (which is also made in other tissues).(h). Conversion of cholesterol to bile salts.(i). Production of many blood proteins (e.g., albumin, blood-clotting proteins).(j). Production of purines and pyrimidines, which are transported to other tissues via red blood cells.(k). Degradation of purines (to uric acid) and pyrimidines (to CO2 , H2 O, and ammonia).(l). Oxidation of drugs and other toxic compounds via the cytochrome P450 system.(m). Conjugation of bilirubin and excretion of bilirubin diglucuronide into the bile.(n). Oxidation of alcohol via alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases and the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS).(o). Synthesis of creatine (from guanidinoacetate), which is used to produce creatine phosphate, mainly in the muscle and brain.(p). Conversion of dietary fructose to glycolytic intermediates.(2). If liver cell function is compromised (e.g., in viral hepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis):(a). NH4+ , which is toxic (particularly to the central nervous system), increases in the blood.(b). The BUN level decreases because the liver has a decreased capacity to produce urea.(c). Blood glucose decreases because of decreased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.(d). Blood cholesterol levels decrease owing to an inability to produce and secrete VLDL.(e). The production of bile salts decreases.(f). Bilirubin levels increase in the body (causing jaundice) because of reduced conjugation with glucuronic acid.(g). Lysis of damaged liver cells allows enzymes to leak into the blood.1. Lactate dehydrogenase increases.2. Alanine aminotransferase increases.3. Aspartate aminotransferase increases.4. Alkaline phosphatase increases.(h). Chronic liver problems result in decreased protein synthesis.1. Serum proteins (e.g., albumin) decrease.2. VLDL production decreases because of decreased apolipoprotein B-100 and triacylglycerols accumulate in the liver. A fatty liver results.g. Brain(1). Glucose is the major fuel for the brain.(2). The brain can use ketone bodies, but only after 3 to 5 days of fasting when blood ketone body levels are elevated.(3). The brain needs energy to think (i.e., memory involves RNA synthesis), conduct nerve impulses, synthesize neurotransmitters, and so on.h. Red blood cells(1). Red blood cells lack mitochondria, so they have no TCA cycle, b-oxidation of fatty acids, electron transport chain, and other pathways that occur in the mitochondria.(2). Glucose is the major fuel for red blood cells.(a). Glucose is converted to pyruvate and lactate.(3). Red blood cells carry bases and nucleosides from the liver to other tissues.(4). The major function of red blood cells is to carry O2 from the lungs to the tissues and to aid in the return of CO2 from the tissues to the lungs.i. Adipose tissue(1). The major fuel of adipose tissue is glucose.(2). Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose into adipose cells.(3). The function of adipose tissue is to store triacylglycerol in the fed state and release it (via lipolysis) during fasting.(a). In the fed state, insulin stimulates the synthesis and secretion of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which degrades the triacylglycerols of chylomicrons and VLDL in the capillaries. Fatty acids from these lipoproteins enter adipose cells and are converted to triacylglycerols and stored. Glucose provides the glycerol moiety. (Glycerol is not used because adipose cells lack glycerol kinase.)(b). During fasting, adipocyte triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase (phosphorylated and activated via a cAMP-mediated mechanism) initiate lipolysis in adipose cells.j. Muscle(1). Muscle uses all fuels that are available (glycogen stores, and fatty acids, glucose, ketone bodies, lactate, and amino acids from the blood) to obtain energy for contraction.(2). During fasting, muscle protein is degraded to provide amino acids (particularly alanine) for gluconeogenesis.(3). Creatine phosphate transports high-energy phosphate from the mitochondria to actinomyosin fibers and provides ATP for muscle contraction.(4). Creatinine is produced nonenzymatically from creatine phosphate, and a constant amount (dependent on the body muscle mass) is released into the blood each day and excreted by the kidneys.(5). Muscle glycogen phosphorylase differs from liver phosphorylase but catalyzes the same reaction (glycogen+Pi-glucose-1-phosphate).(6). Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose into muscle cells.k. Heart(1). The heart is a specialized muscle that uses all fuels from the blood.(2). The muscle-brain (MB) isozyme of CK is found in heart muscle. Its release can be used to monitor a heart attackl. Kidney(1). The kidney excretes substances from the body via the urine, including urea (produced by the urea cycle in the liver), uric acid (from purine degradation), creatinine (from creatine phosphate), NH4+ (from glutamine via glutaminase), H2SO4 (produced from the sulfur of cysteine and methionine), and phosphoric acid.(2). Daily creatinine excretion is constant and depends on the body muscle mass. It is used as a measure of kidney function (the creatinine-clearance rate).(3). Glutaminase action increases during acidosis and produces NH3 , which enters the urine and reacts with H+ to form NH4+ . NH4+ buffers the urine and removes acid (H+) from the body.(4). Uric acid excretion is inhibited by lead (Pb) and metabolic acids (ketone bodies and lactic acid). High blood uric acid can result in gout. Gout can be caused either by increased production or by decreased excretion of uric acid. Deficiency of the base salvage enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome results in increased production of uric acid.(5). Kidney dysfunction can lead to increased BUN, creatinine, and uric acid in the blood and decreased levels of these compounds in the urine.(6). During ketoacidosis, ketone bodies are excreted by the kidney, and during lactic acidosis, lactic acid is excreted.(7). Elevated blood glucose levels (over 180 mg/dL) in DM results in the excretion of glucose in the urine.Intrinsic factor is required for the absorption of dietary vitamin B12 . Lack of B12 (or folate) results in a megaloblastic anemia. In a B12 deficiency, irreversible neurologic problems (due to demyelination) also occur. When decreased intrinsic factor causes a B12 deficiency, the condition is called pernicious anemia. An iron-deficiency anemia is characterized by small, pale RBCs. The lack of iron reduces the synthesis of heme, so the red cells cannot carry as much oxygen (which gives them the pale color). The cells are small in order to maximize the concentration of hemoglobin present in the cells. Hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane fragments, which can occur with pyruvate kinase deficiencies or a lack of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (which results in reduced NADPH levels). Sickle cell anemia is caused by a point mutation in the b-globin gene, substituting a valine for a glutamic acid.When Blood Sugar Increases:When Blood Sugar Decreases:Insulin is released, which leads to the dephosphorylation of:Glucagon is released, which leads to the phosphorylation of:PFK-2 (kinase activity now active)PFK-2 (phosphatase activity now active)Pyruvate kinase (now active)Pyruvate kinase (now inactive)Glycogen synthase (now active)Glycogen synthase (now inactive)Phosphorylase kinase (now inactive)Phosphorylase kinase (now active)Glycogen phosphorylase (now inactive)Glycogen phosphorylase (now active)Pyruvate dehydrogenase (now active)Pyruvate dehydrogenase (now inactive)Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (now active)Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (now inactive)Which leads to activeGlycolysis GlycogenolysisFatty acid synthesisFatty acid oxidationGlycogen synthesisGluconeogenesis Liver Enzymes Regulated by Activation/InhibitionEnzymeActivated byState in Which ActivePhosphofructokinase 1Fructose 2,6-bisP, AMPFedPyruvate carboxylaseAcetyl-CoAFed and fastingAcetyl-CoA carboxylaseCitrateFedCarnitine palmitoyltransferase ILoss of inhibitor (malonyl-CoA)FastingLiver Enzymes Regulated by Phosphorylation/DephosphorylationEnzymeActive formState in Which ActiveGlycogen synthaseDephosphorylatedFedPhosphorylase kinasePhosphorylatedFastingGlycogen phosphorylasePhosphorylatedFastingPhosphofructokinase- 2/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (acts as a kinase, increasing fructose2,6-bisP levels)DephosphorylatedFedPhosphofructokinase-2/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (acts as aphosphatase, decreasing fructose 2,6-bisP levels)PhosphorylatedFastingPyruvate kinaseDephosphorylatedFedPyruvate dehydrogenaseDephosphorylatedFed",

The are hydroxylated by corresponding \"hydroxylases\" in presence of vitamin C, Fe++ and molecular O23. Functional activity of Fibroblasts/Osteoblasts - formation of MPS of connective tissue, dentine and intercellular cement substance of capillaries.4. Role in Tryptophan metabolism - as a cofactor for hydroxylation of tryptophan to form 5-OH derivative in the pathway of biosynthesis of serotonin (5-HT)5. Role in Tyrosine metabolism as a cofactor with the enzyme P-OH phenyl pyruvate hydroxylase, which is necessary for hydroxylation and conversion of P-OH phenyl pyruvate to Homogentisic acid (Alkaptonuria)6. Formation of Active FH4 (Tetrahydrofolate) - vitamin-C regulates the conversion of folic acid to folinic acid (so-called citrovorum factor)7. Formation of Ferritin; ATP, NAD+ and NADP+ stimulates the process.8. Absorption of Fe - helps in absorption of Fe in foods. (hypochromic, microcytic anemia)9. Role in electron transport system of mammalian microsomes10. Action on Certain Enzymes-Activation/Inhibition - Arginase and papain are activated, whereas, activity of the enzymes like urease and b-amylase from plants is inhibited11. Role in formation of Catecholamines - as a coenzyme with the enzyme dopamine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine12. Role in formation of Carnitine - Formation of 'carnitine' in liver by hydroxylation by g-butyrobetain13. Role in a-oxidation of fatty acids helps in action of the enzyme a-hydroxylase (a-mono-oxygenase)14.

Retinyl esters are hydrolysed in liver and is released as retinol (ol - alcohol) into circulation* Retinol is transported as retinol bound to retinol binding protein and is taken up by tissues and is converted by alcohol dehydrogenase and by aldehyde dehydrogenase to form retinal (al - aldehyde) and then retinoic acid (acid)* Retnoic acid then binds to two classes of retinoic acid receptors - RAR (Retinoic acid A receptor) and RXR (Retinoic acid X receptor)* RAR and RXR are transcription factors* They bind to specific regions and regulate expression of various genes related to growth and development of tissues* Retinoids contribute to expression of Hox gene. Hox gene is involved in axial skeleton development* Hence excess retinoids disrupt the genetic control of axial patterning in developing embryo - affecting spinal cord (spinabifida) and brain (microcephaly, anencephaly)* It has been found that exposure of embryos during gestational age 2 through 6 days present with more abnormalities* Use of certain artificial derivatives of retinoic acid prove to be more dangerous than natural forms. Intake of 13-cis-retinoic acid by women during pregnancy for example, results in developmental irregularities in fetuses and children, such as cleft palates, absent or abnormally small ears, heart defects, and thymus abnormalities. For children whose mother were exposed to Etretinate, which is similar to 13-cis-retinoic acid, they exhibit limb defects as well as cardiac and thymus abnormalities. The risk of fetal malformations from exposure to etretinate persists for a longer period of time after the pregnant women's exposure to the substance ends because etretinate stores in her deep body compartments, especially fat depots, and has an extremely long half life (120 days) in the human body. 13-cis-retinoic acid has a shorter half life than etretinate.",

The lack of iron reduces the synthesis of heme, so the red cells cannot carry as much oxygen (which gives them the pale color). The cells are small in order to maximize the concentration of hemoglobin present in the cells. A megaloblastic anemia is caused by deficiencies in either vitamin B12 or folic acid (a lack of intrinsic factor will lead to a B12 deficiency named pernicious anemia). These cells are large because the vitamin deficiency interferes with DNA synthesis, and the cells double in size without being able to replicate their DNA. Once the anemia begins, the large blast cells are released by the marrow in an attempt to control the anemia. Hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane fragments, which can occur with pyruvate kinase deficiencies or a lack of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (which results in reduced NADPH levels).
