Cases: Early diagnosis and treatment: With early diagnosis and treatment, carrier stage can be prevented. Isolation: Owing to the infectious nature of typhoid fever, cases should be isolated till three bacteriologically negative stools and urine repos are obtained on three separate days. Disinfection: Stools and urine are sole source of infection. They should be received in closed containers and disinfected with 5% cresol for at least 2 hours. All solid clothes and linen should be soaked in a solution of 2% chlorine and steam sterilized. All the medical and paramedical person should disinfect their hands. Follow-up: Follow up examination of stool and urine should be done 3-4 months after discharge of patient and again after 12 months to prevent the development of carrier stage. B. Carriers Identification: Culture of duodenal drainage establishes the presence of Salmonella in the biliary tract in carriers. The Vi antibody is seen in up to 80% of carriers. Treatment: Ampicillin or amoxycillin (4-6 g a day) together with probenecid can achieve eradication of carrier stage in about 70%. Cholecystectomy with concomitant ampicillin therapy is the most successful approach for treatment of carriers. Surveillance: The carriers should be kept under surveillance and are prevented from handling food, milk for others. Control of Sanitation: The weakest link in the chain of transmission is sanitation which can be achieved easily Protection and purification of drinking water supplies, improvement of basic sanitation and promotion of food hygiene are essential measures of controlling typhoid.

This technique allows for a presumptive diagnosis of syphilis even before antibodies have developed. Although, unstained living organisms may be observed with an ordinary light microscope, they are seen much more clearly and with a better resolution with a dark ground microscope, which has an optical system that enhances the contrast of unstained bodies. Principle of dark ground microscopy: The dark ground microscope creates a contrast between the object and the surrounding field, such that, the background is dark and the object is bright. The objective and the ocular lenses used in the dark ground microscope are the same as in the ordinary light microscope,however, a special condenser is used, which prevents the transmitted light from directly illuminating the specimen. Only oblique scattered/reflected light reaches the specimen and passes onto the lens system causing the object to appear bright against a dark background Transmitted light is used in the ordinary microscope.",

This test is considered to be positive if large wheal, 5 cm in diameter with multiple pseudopodia develop in 30 minutes. Other test used to diagnose hydatid disease are: Antigen detection test: Antigen in urine can be detected by counter current immunoelectrophoresis. Antigen in serum can be detected by ELISA, counter current immunoelectrophoresis, co-agglutination test, and latex agglutination test. Detection of antibody: By indirect haemagglutination test, fluorescent antibody test, counter current immunoelectrophoresis, latex agglutination test, ELISA, western blot test. MRI, Ultrasonography and CT scanning readily demonstrate cysts. The most pathognomonic finding, if demonstrable, is the presence of daughter cysts within the larger cyst. Diagnostic aspiration of cystic fluid is not usually recommended because of the risk of fluid leakage resulting in either dissemination of infection or anaphylactic reactions.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., VDRL . Neurological symptoms in a patient with history of untreated ulcer 3 years back suggests the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. To fuher clear the doubts, all the given options are serological tests for syphilis. So, the examiner is asking about the syphilis for sure. . It has alreadys been explained that for monitoring of response of therapy non specific serological tests (VDRL or RPR) are used as the specific treponemal tests remain positive inspite of treatment. Now question arises, whether to use VDRL or RPR as both the options are there in this question. Following statement will clear your doubts? \" The VDRL ( a standard test) will often indicate cure as measured by negative serologies by 12 months after therapy, whereas the RPR shows only 50% seroconversion i.e. negative serology at one year\"....................... Annals on internal medicine Like VDRL test RPR test can also be used to monitor the treatment in syphilis but it is not suitable for testing C.S.F., so it cannot be used in neurosyphilis. . Titres are not interchangable between different test types. Hence, the same non-treponemal test should be used for follow up. e.g. if one has used VDRL at first follow up, then VDR1 should be used at every follow up. You should also keep in mind that though after adequate treatment of syphilis non treponemal tests (non specific tests) eventually become non-reactive. Sometimes even with sufficient treatment patients have a persistent low level positive nontreponemal test, reffered to as a serofast reaction.",

It is a very stable medium and can be stored for use in screw capped containers. It is a semi-solid transpo medium. At least two swabs should be inoculated. Alternative transpo media for vibrio cholera are Venkataraman-Ramakrishnan medium (V-R fluid) or alkaline peptone water.VR fluid should be prepared in 30 ml (1 oz) screw capped bottles (MacCaney bottles). It preserves vibrios for more than 6 weeks and has also proved to be very convenient medium for transpoation as it can be kept at room temperature after collection of specimen. If none of the transpo medium is available, collect watery stool from suspected cholera case by soaking blotting paper strip in the stool, sealing the strip in a polythene bag or an aiight container where the strip does not dry. The moist blotting paper strip can then be transpoed to the laboratory. Blotting papers have been found to be superior to the filter paper as the former can soak more moisture and retain the same over longer periods thus maintaining the bility of vibrios absorbed on it.",

        "exp": "Vitamin B12 deficiency with resulting megaloblastic anemia is specifically associated with infection with the fish tapeworm, Diphyllobothrium latum. The adult worm attaches to the small intestinal mucosa and releases eggs into the feces. Crustaceans living in contaminated water ingest free-swimming embryos that hatch from the eggs. Ceain species of fish ingest the crustaceans, then humans acquire the infection by ingesting the undercooked or raw fish. Vitamin B12 deficiency can develop because the tapeworm absorbs vitamin B12 from the intestinal lumen and also interferes with ileal B12 absorption. Clonorchis sinensis infections produce obstruction of the biliary tract or pancreatic duct and are associated with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. Echinococcus granulosus larvae infect humans and produce unilocular cystic lesions in the liver. Echinococcus is prevalent in areas in which dogs are used to help raise livestock. Taenia saginata is the beef tapeworm ; it causes diarrhea but not vitamin B12 deficiency. Ref: Brooks G.F. (2013). Chapter 46. Medical Parasitology. In G.F.

D: Infectious Mononucleosis The standard diagnostic procedure for infectious mononucleosis is the Paul-Bunnell test Heterophile antibody tests Such as the Paul Bunnell or Monospot tests may be used in the diagnosis of glandular fever/ infectious mononucleosis. Heterophil antibodies have the ability to agglutinate red blood cells of different animal species. The Paul-Bunnell test uses sheep erythrocytes; the Monospot test, horse red cells. For infectious mononucleosis, the standard diagnostic procedure is the Paul-Bunnel test IgM heterophil antibodies are usually detectable for the first 3 months of infection. Characteristically, they are able to agglutinate sheep erythrocytes; it is absorbed by ox red blood cell but not guinea-pig kidney cells. Infectious mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis occurs with infection by the Epstein-Barr virus. A similar condition can be caused by cytomegalovirus, but that one gives a negative on the heterophile antibody test. The infection is spread saliva and has an incubation period of 4-7 weeks. Symptoms usually persist for 2-3 weeks, The virus replicates first within epithelial cells in the pharynx (which causes pharyngitis, or sore throat), and later primarily within B cells (which are invaded their CD21). The host immune response involves cytotoxic (CD8-positive) T cells against infected B lymphocytes, resulting in enlarged atypical lymphocytes (Downey cells). When the infection is acute (recent onset, instead of chronic), heterophile antibodies are produced The most commonly used diagnostie-criterion is the presence of 50% lymphocytes with at least 10% atypical lymphocytes (large, irregular nuclei), while the person also has fever, pharyngitis and adenopathy. The atypical lymphocytes resembled monocytes when they were first discovered, thus the term \"mononucleosis\" was coined. The presence of splenomegaly, posterior cervical adenopathy, axillary adenopathy, and inguinal adenopathy are the most useful to suspect a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. On the other hand, the absence of cervical adenopathy and fatigue are the most useful to dismiss the idea of infectious mononucleosis as the correct diagnosis. Elevated hepatic transaminase levels is highly suggestive of infectious mononucleosis, occurring in up to 50% of patients. A fibrin ring granuloma may be present",

It is a common parasite of humans and pigs and is most prevalent in Southern and Southeaster n Asia. It is a member of the family Fasciolidae in the order Echinostomida. The Echinostomida are members of the class Trematoda, the flukes. The fluke differs from most species that parasitise large mammals, in that they inhabit the gut rather than the liver as Fasciola species do. Fasciolopsis buski generally occupies the upper region of the small intestine, but in heavy infestations can also be found in the stomach and lower regions of the intestine.

        "question": "Autoimmunity can be caused due to all of the following except -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Negative selection of T cell in thymus -Autoimmunity is the reactivity of the body towards self antigen i.e. the immune system stas to consider the host cell as foreign antigen and mounts an immune response against it. - Normally the immune system does not show any reactivity to self antigen. They are able to discriminate between foreign antigen and host cell. This is called immune tolerance or self tolerance. - How does immune tolerance develop? - The immune system removes cells which show self reactivity to antigens. The process of removing these cells is broadly classified into two categories. a)Central tolerance b)Peripheral tolerance . Central tolerance - The premature lymphocytes which are self reactive are killed in the central organs i.e. organs where they mature (i.e. Bone marrow in case of B lymphocytes and Thymus in case of T lymphocytes) - This process is called central deletion or negative selection i.e. the process which does not allow self reactive cells to grow. Sometimes instead of killing the self reactive cells only their receptors are deleted, this is called central editing or receptor editing. . Peripheral tolerance - Central tolerance is not able to kill all the premature self reactive cells. Some cells escape central tolerance; they mature and move out in the peripheral lymphoid system. The mechanism by which these cells are inactivated or removed in the peripheral lymphoid system is called peripheral tolerance. There are five main mechanisms operating in peripheral tolerance, these are : i) Anergy - This refers to prolonged or irreversible functional inactivation of self reactive lymphocytes ii) Suppression by regulatory T cells - Sometimes regulatory cells are present to suppress the self reactive T lymphocytes iii) Clonal deletion by activation induced cell death - Self reactive lymphocytes receive signals that promote their death by apoptosis iv) Antigen Sequestration - Some self reactive lymphocytes cannot react against the host cells because these cells or antigens are located in the tissues which do not communicate with blood e.g. testis, eye, and brain. These sites are called immune privileged sites, because it is difficult to induce immune response to antigen in these sites. v) Cytokine activation . So, these are the layers of self tolerance for an autoimmune disease to develop in the body, these layers of self tolerance should be disrupted or bypassed. Mechanism of development of Autoimmunity 1. Exogenous a)Molecular mimicry - Cross reactivity between a microbial product and a self antigeng might lead to activation of autoreactive lymphocytes. b)Superantigenic stimulation - Microbial superantigens, such as staphylococcal protein 'A' and enterotoxin, can stimulate a broad range of T and B cells irrespetive of their antigen specificity. c) Microbial adjuvanticity - Infectious agent may be able to overcome self tolerance because they possess molecules, such as bacterial endotoxin, that have adjuvant like effect which enhances immunogenicity of autoantigen. 2. Endogenous A) Altered antigen presention a) Loss of immunologic privilege - If the privileged site are damaged by trauma or inflammation, the sequestrated autoantigens (lens, brain protein) communicate with blood and lead to activation of autoreactive lymphocytes. b) Presentation of Cryptic epitopes (option b) - Protein determinants (epitopes) of an antigen is not routinely seen by lymphocytes (cryptotic epitopes) are recognized as a result of immunologic reactivity to associated molecules. Infections may release and damage self antigen and expose epitopes of this antigen that are normally concealed from immune system, i.e., cryptic epitopes. c)Alteration of self antigen - Inflammation of drug exposure may cause a primary chemical alteration in proteins which may be recognized as autoantigen. d)Enhanced function of antigen presenting cells by costimulatory molecular expression and cytokine production may cause autoimmunity. B) Increased T cell help - Intense stimulation of T-cells can produce nonspecific signals that bypass the need for antigen - specific helper T cells and lead to polyclonal B cell activation with formation of multiple autoantibodies. C) Increased B cell function - Nonspecific stimulation of polyclonal B cell by B cell activators, such as bacterial endotoxin, may also lead to production of autoantibodies. D) Apoptotic defect - Clones of cells that had immunological reactivity with self antigen are eliminated during embryonic life by apoptosis. Such clones are called \"forbidden clones\". This negative selection of autoreactive T cells in the thymus requires expression of the autoimmune regular (AIRE) gene that enables the expression of tissue specific proteins of tissue specific ptoeins in thymic medullary cells. Peptides from these proteins are expressed in context of MHC molecules and mediate the elimination of autoreactive T cells. The absence of AIRE gene interferes expression ofproteins in context MHC molecules and leads to failure of negative selection of autoreactive T cells. E) Cytokine imbalance - Diminished production of IL-10 and TNF can lead to autoimmunity due to diminished inhibitory effect on autoreactive lymphocytes. Altered immunoregulation - Defect in the generation and expression of regullatory T cell activity may allow for the production of autoimmunity.",

This process is known as lysogenic\nconversion or phage conversion.\nExample: Lysogenic conversion in corynebacterium diphtheria converts it into pathogenic bacteria. After\nlysogenic conversion, C. diphtheria acquires the ability to produce toxin.\nBacteriophage\n\u2022 Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria.\n\u2022 Bacteriophages resemble most viruses in having a protein coat called a capsid that surrounds a\nmolecule of DNA or RNA.\n\u2022 Typical phages have hollow heads (where DA or RNA is stored) and tunnel tails.\nThe tail possesses many fibres. The fibres ha%re the ability to bind to specific molecules on the bacterial\ncell surface.\n\u2022 When a phage binds to bacterial cell surface it is called adsorption. The phage then undergoes\npenetration, in which the viral DNA is injected through the tail into the host.\nTypes of phages: Lytic or virulent phages and Temperate or prophages\n1. Lytic or virulent phages:\nLytic phages multiply inside the cell and release a burst of phages through the membrane, lysing the cell.\n2. Prophages or temperate phages:\nProphages or temperate phages, on the other hand, do not immediately lyse the bacteria they infect. Instead,\nthey integrate their DNA into host DNA creating a phage.\nThe phage DNA in this repressed state is called a prophage (because it is not a phage but it has the potential\nto produce phage)\nThe integrated state of phage DNA is termed prophage, whereas, the process is known as lysogeny and the\nbacteria harbouring the prophage are called lysogenic bacteria.\nSince the prophage contains genes, it can. confer new properties to the bacteria.\nWhen a bacteria becomes lysogenized, occasionally, extra genes carried by the phage gets expressed in the\u00a0bacteria.

This process\nis known as lysogenic conversion or phage conversion.\nLysogenic conversion in Corynebacterium Diphtheria converts it into pathogenic bacteria. After lysogenic\u00a0conversion, C. diphtheria acquires the ability' to produce toxin.\nLysogenic conversion is also seen in Salmonella typhi and Clostridium botulinum.\nTransduction\nTransduction occurs when bacteriophage carries a piece of bacterial DNA from one bacterium to another.\n\u2022 Transduction is not only confined to transfer of chromosomal DNA, episomes and plasmid may also be\u00a0transduced.\n\u2022 The plasmid is a DNA molecule that is separate from and can replicate independently of\u00a0chromosomal.\n\u2022 Types of transduction.\n\u2022 Lytic phages cause generalized transduction.\n\u2022 Temperate phages cause specialized transduction",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Double stranded DNA virus HIV belongs to the lentivirus subgroup of the family retroviridae. HIV is a spherical, enveloped virus. The genome is diploid, composed of two identical single-stranded, positive sense RNA copies. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) like many other viruses, stores its genetic information as RNA rather than as DNA (most other living things use DNA). In association with viral RNA is the reverse transcriptase enzyme which is a characteristic feature of retroviruses. When HIV enters a human cell, it releases its RNA, and an enzyme called reverse transcriptase makes a DNA copy of the HIV RNA. The resulting HIV DNA is integrated into the infected cell's DNA. This process is the reverse of that used by human cells, which make an RNA copy of DNA. Thus, HIV is called a retrovirus, referring to the reversed (backward) process. Other RNA viruses (such as polio, influenza, or measles), unlike retroviruses, do not make DNA copies after they invade cells. They simply make RNA copies of their original RNA. Some types of white blood cells called CD4+ lymphocytes HIV is highly mutable virus, unlike HTLV.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Sand fly Kala-azar is spread through an insect vector, the sandfly of the Phlebotomus genus. The sandfly vector becomes infected when feeding on the blood of an infected individual or an animal reservoir host. The leishmania parasites live in the macrophages as round, non-motile amastigotes (3-7 micrometers in diameter). The macrophages are ingested by the fly during the blood- meal and the amastigotes are relesed into the stomach of insect. Almost immediately the amastigotes transform in to the motile, elongated (10-20 micrometers), flagellate promastigote form. The promastigotes then migrate to the alimentary tract of the fly, where they live extracellularly and multiply by binary fission. Four to five days after feeding the promastigotes move forward to the oesophagus and the salivary glands of the insect. When the sandlfy next feeds on a mammalian host, it's proboscis pierces the skin and saliva containing anticoagulant is injected into the wound to prevent the blood from clotting, the leishmania promastigotes are transferred to the host along with the saliva. Once in the host the promastigotes are taken up by the macrophages where they rapidly reve to the amastigote form. The leishmania are able to resist the microbiocidal action of the acid hydrolases release form the lysozymes and so survive and multiply inside the macrophages, eventually leading to the lysis of the macrophages. The released amastigotes are taken up by additional macrophages and so the cycle continues. Ultimately all the organs containing macrophages and phagocytes are infected, especially the spleen, liver and bone marrow.",

The absence of HBsAg and HBsAb from the serum of this patient is reflective of which of the following?",
        "exp": "The patient has clearly returned from Calcutta with an active infection of Hepatitis B, since his serum is positive for antibody against the core antigen of Hepatitis B. This is the standard diagnostic for this infection. The absence of HBsAg and HBsAb from the serum reflects that the patient has entered the \"window period,\" a good prognostic indicator, because it demonstrates that antibodies to the surface antigen are being made in enough concentration to precipitate the corresponding antigen out of the circulation. This is the in vivo demonstration of the equivalence zone in the antibody/antigen precipitation titration. Successful vaccination against Hepatitis B would be reflected by a positive titer of HBsAb only. The presence of antibody against the c core antigen reflects the existence of an active infection. Anergy to Hepatitis B is not correct, because a person who is anergic is selectively unresponsive or tolerant to the antigen in question. Clearly, the presence of antibodies to several of these viral antigens in the serum demonstrates that the person is not anergic. Although the person is beginning to mount a protective immune response (antibody to HBsAg), it has not yet reached a protective level. Ref: Ray C.G., Ryan K.J. (2010). Chapter 13. Hepatitis Viruses.

The final phase is the death phase, which is marked by a decline in the number of ble bacteria. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 3. Growth. In W.

These viruses are nonenveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains positive-sense RNA. The exception to the rule regarding RNA viruses is the family Ohomyxoviridae, the influenza viruses. Ohomyxoviruses undergo transcription and RNA replication in the nucleus of the host cell because they need to cannibalize the capped 5' termini of cellular RNAs for use as primers for viral mRNA transcription. For most DNA viruses, transcription and DNA replication occur in the nucleus of the host cell. The exception to this observation is the family Poxviridae, which carries out its replication in the cytoplasm. Poxviridae includes variola virus, vaccinia virus, molluscum contagiosum, and orf virus. Adenoviruses are non enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome. Cytomegalovirus is a member of family Herpesviridae.

The installation of silver and copper ionization systems similar to those used in large swimming pools has been effective as a last reso in hospitals plagued with recurrent nosocomial legionellosis.

        "exp": "Entamoeba are relatively common enteric pathogens that can produce asymptomatic infection or more severe disease characterized by mucosal ulcerations and submucosal spread causing abdominal distress and liquid stools. Stools may show either trophozoite forms or the typical spherical cysts. Several species of Entamoeba are seen, including Entamoeba coli and E. hamanni. E. histolytica cysts characteristically are spherical in shape, 10-20 mm in diameter, and have granular cytoplasm containing 1, 2, or 4 nuclei. Cryptosporidium parvum infections occur in the immunocompromised population and may cause severe diarrhea. The organism presents as minute (2-5 mm) intracellular spheres or arc-shaped merozoites under normal mucosa, and can be difficult to appreciate by light microscopy. Cysts in the stool are too small (4-5 mm) to be confused with Entamoeba. Dientamoeba fragilis is an intestinal amoeba that also may produce an infectious diarrhea. It does not have a cyst form, and only the trophozoite forms are seen in stools. Giardia lamblia is a flagellate protozoan that infects the stomach and small intestine when contaminated water is ingested. Diagnosis is usually made by examining duodenal contents; however, the stools may contain the oval or elliptical cysts, which are thick-walled and measure 8-14 mm in diameter. Spherical cysts are not seen in Giardia infection. Ref: Ray C.G., Ryan K.J. (2010). Chapter 51. Rhizopods. In C.G. Ray, K.J. Ryan (Eds), Sherris Medical Microbiology, 5e.",

His CD4 cell count, however, is still within normal limits, and the virus is undetectable in the blood. Genetic investigations clarify this apparent puzzle, demonstrating that this subject is homozygous for a mutation affecting a chemokine receptor necessary for HIV entry into the cell. Which of the following receptors is most likely involved?",
        "exp": "HIV infection does not always progress to ove AIDS. In a few founate individuals (called non-progressors), the infection remains asymptomatic, with a stable CD4 cell count and low or undetectable viremia. It is not entirely clear whether these patients will eventually develop AIDS. Some are resistant to HIV infection because they carry two defective copies of the gene encoding the CCR5 coreceptor. There are 15 known coreceptors, of which CCR5 and CXCR4 are the best characterized. CCR5 is a receptor for b-chemokines and serves as a coreceptor for HIV internalization. Approximately one percent of Caucasians in the U.S. is homozygous for such a protective CCR5 variant, and 20% are heterozygotes. HIV infection follows a slower course in heterozygotes. Homozygotes for this protective CCR5 variant are not present among Black and Asian populations. Recently, a variant haplotype of CXCR1 (a leukocyte receptor for fractalkine) has been linked to rapid progression of HIV infection in homozygous individuals. Thus, investigations on HIV coreceptors are beginning to explain the variability in progression and severity of HIV infection among individuals. CD4 (2nd Choice) is an impoant receptor of helper T lymphocytes, macrophages, and Langerhans cells. It acts as the primary receptor for HIV binding. Binding to CD4, however, is not sufficient for the entry of HIV into the cells. The viral envelope gp120 protein (4th Choice) first binds CD4. This results in a conformational change in gp120 that allows this protein to bind coreceptors. Such coreceptors are present on lymphocytes and macrophages and normally serve as binding sites for chemokines. Once gp120 binds to CD4 and a coreceptor, a second viral protein, gp41, facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane, allowing \"injection\" of the viral core into the cell. Neither CD8 (5th Choice) nor the receptor for TNF-a plays a role in HIV binding to cells.",

Respiratory syncytial virus is the most impoant cause of (bronchiolitis) lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children. SSPE, the rare late complication of measles infection, occurs with an incidence of about 1:300,000 cases. The disease begins insidiously 5-15 years after a case of measles; it is characterized by progressive mental deterioration, involuntary movements, muscular rigidity, and coma. It is usually fatal within 1-3 years after onset. Patients with SSPE exhibit high titers of measles antibody in cerebrospinal fluid and serum and defective measles virus in brain cells. With the widespread use of measles vaccine, SSPE has become less common. Parainfluenza viruses are ubiquitous and cause common respiratory illness in persons of all ages. They are major pathogens of severe respiratory tract disease in infants and young children. Only RSV causes more cases of serious respiratory disease in children. They attach haemagglutinin to sialic acid containing receptors on the cell surface of respiratory epithelium. Ref: Brooks G.F., Carroll K.C., Butel J.S., Morse S.A., Mietzneron T.A. (2010).

ETEC disease is rare in industrialized nations, although recent outbreaks suggest that it may be underestimated. Also Know: Transmission is by consumption of food and water contaminated by infected human or convalescent carriers. ETEC diarrhea is caused by strains of E coli that produce LT and/or ST enterotoxins in the proximal small intestine. Strains that elaborate both LT and ST cause more severe illness. Adherence to surface microvilli mediated by the colonizing factor (CF) pili is essential for the efficient delivery of toxin to the target enterocytes.LT and/or ST cause fluid outpouring in small intestine. Infections with ETEC can stimulate immunity. This natural immunity is presumably mediated by sIgA specific for LT and CFs. Ref: Ray C.G., Ryan K.J. (2010). Chapter 33. Enterobacteriaceae. In C.G.

Delayed hypersensitivity reactions are the results of CD4+ TH1 cells. These cells do not produce antibody.

        "exp": "Anaerobic lung abscesses commonly arise from aspirated oral secretions in patients with compromised neurological status (e.g., anesthesia, coma, intoxication), or in individuals with a depressed cough reflex. The most common anaerobic organisms isolated from lung abscesses include Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Peptococcus species, all of which are typical oral flora. Bloodborne pathogens producing lung abscesses probably originate as emboli from vegetations on the right hea. The most likely pathogens in endocarditis are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species; Fusobacterium would be very unusual. Fusobacterium usually is not pathogenic and lives in a commensal relationship with the host. Infective aerosols generally contain organisms that are intrinsically pathogenic (e.g., mycobacteria, influenza virus). It is the acidity of the gastric aspirate that most seriously injures the lung, not the gastric bacteria. Fusobacterium do inhabit the gastrointestinal tract, but ble bacteria are much more likely to be transmitted from the oral secretions than from the stomach . Ref: Brooks G.F. (2013). Chapter 21.

S. pyogenes is differentiated from the other beta-hemolytic Strep by its sensitivity to the antibiotic bacitracin. The catalase test is used to differentiate Staphylococci from Streptococci. Staphylococci are catalase positive, Streptococci are catalase negative. So, S. pyogenes would be catalase negative. The coagulase test is used to differentiate Staph aureus from the other Staph spp. Staph aureus is coagulase positive; the others are negative. Sensitivity to novobiocin is used to differentiate Staph saprophyticus (resistant) from Staph epidermidis (sensitive). Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 66. Tolerance & Autoimmune Disease. In W.

Unique propeies of chlamydiae are Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular parasite. This means they can survive only by establishig residence inside animal cells They need their host's ATP as an energy source for their own cellular activity. They are energy parasites using a cell membrane transpo system that uses ATP from the host system and gives out ADP. This obligate intracellular existence makes it impossible to culture these organisms on nonliving aificial media. Due to their small size and failure to grow in cell - free media they were considered to be viruses. Chlamydiae grows in cultures of a variety of eukaryotic cell lines Mc Coy or HeLa cells. It may be necessary to treat cells with polyanionic compounds such as DEAD-dextran to reduce the electrostatic barrier to infection. Antimetabolite such as cycloheximide is added to our competition for host cell amino acid pools. All types of chlamydiae proliferate in embryonated eggs paiculary in the yolk sac. The special features in structure and chemical composition of chlamydiae are: The outer cell wall resembles the cell wall of gram negative bacteria It has a relatively high lipid content It is rigid but it does not contain typical bacterial peptidoglycan; perhaps it contain a tetrapeptide linked matrix.

This means they can survive only by establishig residence inside animal cells They need their host's ATP as an energy source for their own cellular activity. They are energy parasites using a cell membrane transpo system that uses ATP from the host system and gives out ADP. . This obligate intracellular existence makes it impossible to culture these organisms on nonliving aificial media. Due to their small size and failure to grow in cell - free media they were considered to be viruses. . Chlamydiae grows in cultures of a variety of eukaryotic cell lines Mc Coy or HeLa cells. It may be necessary to treat cells with polyanionic compounds such as DEAD-dextran to reduce the electrostatic barrier to infection. Antimetabolite such as cycloheximide is added to our competition for host cell amino acid pools. All types of chlamydiae proliferate in embryonated eggs paiculary in the yolk sac. . The special features in structure and chemical composition of chlamydiae are: - The outer cell wall resembles the cell wall of gram negative bacteria - It has a relatively high lipid content - It is rigid but it does not contain typical bacterial peptidoglycan; perhaps it contain a tetrapeptide linked matrix. - N Acetylmuramic acid also appears to be absent from chlamydiae cell wall. . Antibiotic susceptibility of chlamydiae: - Penicillin binding proteins occur in chlamydiae cell wall and chlamydiae cell wall formation is inhibited by penicillins and other drugs that inhibit transpeptidation of bacterial peptidoglycan. But remember the impoant point about t/t, that cell wall inhibitors result in the production of morphologically defective forms but are not effective in clinical disease. .

It is caused by a DNA poxvirus called the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). MCV has no nonhuman-animal reservoir (infecting only humans). There are four types of MCV, MCV-1 to -4; MCV-1 is the most prevalent and MCV-2 is seen usually in adults. The virus that causes molluscum is spread from person to person by touching the affected skin. The virus may also be spread by touching a surface with the virus on it, such as a towel, clothing, or toys. Molluscum can be spread from one person to another by sexual contact. This common viral disease has a higher incidence in children, sexually active adults, and those who are immunodeficient, and the infection is most common in children aged one to ten years old. MC can affect any area of the skin but is most common on the trunk of the body, arms, groin, and legs. It is spread through direct contact or shared items such as clothing or towels.",

        "exp": "Bacteria will die as it lacks methylase Bacterias are susceptible to attack by viruses known as bacte- riophages. Bacterias have developed their defense mechanism to protect themselves .from the bacteriophages. The system that bacterias possese against the phage viruses is the restriction modification system? This system consists of restriction endonuclease enzyme and a methylase enzyme. Each bacterial species and strains have their own combination of restriction and methylating enzymes i.e., restriction modification system is species specific Restriction enzyme These are enzymes present in baeteria that recognize specific base sequences in the D.N.A. and, cut the DNA at that site (restriction site). - A restriction enzyme acts as biochemical scissors and are therefore called restriction endonuclease. Bacterias use this enzyme in defense against phage viruses (bacteriophages) When a phage virus infects bacteria it inses its DNA into bacteria so that it gets replicated The restriction enzyme prevents this replication by cutting the D.N.A of the phage virus into many pieces. - When a strain of bacterias lacking restriction enzyme is infected with phage virus most viruses can initiate a successful infection - When the same strain contains a restriction enzyme, however, the probability of successful infection decreases The presence of additional restrictive enzymes has multiplicative effect. A bacteria with four to .five restriction enzyme would be viually impregnable. The bacterial cell uses the restriction enzyme to cut the invading DNA of the virus at a specific site. This prevents the virus replication. But bacterial DNA will also contain sites that could be cleaved by the restriction enzyme. How is the bacterial cell protected. from auto destruction by restriction endonuclease???. Restriction enzyme usually occur in combination with one or two modification enzymes (DNN- methylasetransferase) that protects the cells own DNA from cleavage by the restriction enzytne Modification enzymes recognize the same DNA sequences as the restriction enzymes that they accompany, but, instead of cleaving the sequence they methylate one of the bases in each of the DNA strands. The methyl groups protrude in to the major groove of DNA at the binding site and prevents the restriction enzyme from acting upon it. \"So the viral DNA is restricted in the bacterial cell by restriction enzymes and the bacterial DNA is modified by the methylase and is provided protection from its own restriction enzyme\" -It is impoant to note that the restriction modification system is species specific i.e., each bacterial species has its own restriction modification enzyme. It is significant because the restriction enzyme may kill any virus that invade the bacteria but the methylase enzyme can only protect that paicular bacteria from lysis because it will recognize those bacterial DNA as host and protect it against restriction endonuclease. If a bacteria acquires new restriction endonuclease it would also lyse bacterial DNA because the bacteria does not have the species specific methylase enzyme to protect its DNA from the newly acquired restriction endonuclease.",

T. cruzi is commonly transmitted to humans and other mammals by an insect vector, the blood-sucking insects of the subfamily Triatominae (family Reduviidae) most commonly species belonging to the Triatoma, Rhodnius, and Panstrongylus genera. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion and organ transplantation, ingestion of food contaminated with parasites, and from a mother to her fetus. In the early, acute stage, symptoms are mild and usually produce no more than local swelling at the site of infection. The initial acute phase is responsive to antiparasitic treatments, with 60-90% cure rates. After 4-8 weeks, individuals with active infections enter the chronic phase of Chagas disease that is asymptomatic for 60-80% of chronically infected individuals through their lifetime. The currently available antiparasitic treatments for Chagas disease are benznidazole and nifuimox, which can cause temporary side effects in many patients including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.",

        "exp": "Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), an impoant cause of traveler's diarrhea, produces a toxin that activates intestinal adenylate or guanylate cyclase. Consequently, the intestinal mucosa overexpresses cAMP, resulting in a mild and self-limited secretory diarrhea. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) does not express a toxin, but is seen to cluster over the colonic mucosa in some individuals. Although occasionally found in patients with chronic diarrhea, no clear mechanism for mucosal pathophysiology has been determined for EAEC. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), classically associated with strain O157:H7 and present in undercooked hamburgers, expresses a Shiga-like toxin that causes bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) does not express a toxin, but rather is pathogenic through its capacity to invade the colonic mucosa and evoke an inflammatory response. The resulting dysentery-like inflammatory diarrhea generally necessitates vigilant hydration, but no antibiotics are indicated. Ref: Brooks G.F. (2013). Chapter 15.

B: 121 degree C at for 15 min Sterilization refers to any process that effectively kills or eliminates transmissible agents (such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, prions and spore forms etc.) from a surface, equipment, foods, medications, or biological culture medium. Sterilization can be achieved through application of heat, chemicals, irradiation, high pressure or filtration. It may be defined as: Physical sterilization includes: Heat sterilization Radiation sterilization Chemical sterilization includes: Ethylene oxide Ozone Chlorine bleach Glutaraldehyde Formaldehyde Hydrogen peroxide Peracetic acid Heat Sterilization A widely-used method for heat sterilization is the autoclave Autoclaves commonly use steam heated to 121 degC or 134 degC. To achieve sterility, a holding time of at least 15 minutes at 121 degC or 3 minutes at 134 degC is required. Additional sterilizing time is usually required for liquids and instruments packed in layers of cloth, as they may take longer to reach the required temperature. After sterilization, autoclaved liquids must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. Proper autoclave treatment will inactivate all fungi, bacteria, viruses and also bacterial spores, which can be quite resistant. Indicator tape is often placed on packages of products prior to autoclaving. A chemical in the tape will change color when the appropriate conditions have been met. Biological indicators (\"bioindicators\") can also be used to independently confirm autoclave performance. Most contain spores of the heat resistant microbe Bacillus stearotliermophilus, among the toughest organisms for an autoclave to destroy. If the autoclave destroyed the spores, the medium will remain its original color. If autoclaving was unsuccessful the B. sterothermophilus will metabolize during incubation, causing a color change during the incubation.",

Polymerase chain reaction Serology The most common method of laboratory diagnosis Persons should initially be tested for the presence of Toxoplasma specific IgG antibodies to determine their immune status. A positive IgG titre indicates infection with the organism at sometime ( recent or past). Then an IgG positive person should have an IgM test. A negative test essentially excludes recent infection.

Negative IgM with positive IgG always means a past infection. Positive IgM with positive IgG indicates possibility of recent infection, but not with 100% surety. It may or may not be recent infection. To differentiate between recent and past infection, IgG avidity test is used.

D: Staphylococcus aureus Inflammatory pneumatocoeles result from a rapidly progressive inflammation in which there are plugging of the smaller bronchi in the affected areas, destruction of the distal alveolar tissue, and cystic hyperexpansion of the air space. Pneumatocoeles are found much more often in children than in adults. They are seen paicularly in infants and children with staphylococcal pneumonia. However, they have also been described in pneumonia due to other micro-organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella, Hemophilus influenzae, and in measles pneumonitis. On chest radiographs, they appear as thin-walled,rounded radiolucencies in areas of pneumonic consolidation. They can be single or multiple. As the surrounding consolidation resolves, the pneumatocoeles become more apparent and/or enlarge. Thus, they are usually seen during the resolution stage of pneumonitis.

The provirus initiate viral replication by directing synthesis of viral RNA and other components. When naked virus buds outs through host cell surface membrane, it acquires a lipoprotein envelope which consist of lipid derived from the host cell membrane and glycoprotein which are virus coded. The spikes which constitute the major surface component of the virus, binds to CD4 receptors on susceptible host cells. The transmembrane pedicle cause cell fusion.

Systemic signs and symptoms, such as malaise and headache, are mild or absent, and fever is unusual. Illness generally lasts for 4-9 days and resolves spontaneously without sequelae.

IL1 and TNF alpha are endogenous pyrogens that are capable of stimulating fever, promoting local inflammatory reactions and synthesis of acute phase proteins. TNF alpha is the ultimate mediator of inflammation and the systemic effects of infection. It stimulates endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules and chemokines to attract leukocytes to the site of infection, activates neutrophils and macrophages, and promotes apoptosis of ceain cell types. Systemically, TNF alpha acts on the hypothalamus to induce fever, can cause systemic metabolic changes, weight loss and loss of appetite, and enhance production of IL1, IL6, and chemokines and it promotes acute phase protein synthesis by the liver.

        "exp": "Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes A, B, and C) causes a conjunctival and corneal infection that is spread in developing countries by eye-seeking flies. The lesions begin with formation of lymphoid follicles in the conjunctiva. With disease progression, there is tissue necrosis, granulation tissue deposition, and scar formation, leading to lacrimal duct obstruction and distoion of the eyelids. With the loss of an adequate tear system, the cornea becomes vulnerable to dehydration and opacification. Also, the vigorous inflammatory response can directly involve the cornea, with resulting opacity. In developed countries, chlamydial eye infections are often transmitted venereally rather than by flies, and may cause conjunctivitis in the newborn and in sexually active young adults.
