Mast cells o IgE binds to Mast cells and basophils, and mediate Type I hypersensitivity.Type 1 hypersensitivity ( Immediate hypersensitivity)o It is a rapidly developing immunological reaction occuring within minutes after the combination of an antigen with antibody bound to mast cells in individuals previously sensitized to the antigen,o Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by Ig E, but T and B cells play important roles in the development of these antibodies.o Type I reaction requires prior sensitization to a specific antigen (allergen),o Most exposures occur either by inhalation (respiratory route) or ingestion (GIT) of antigen,o Type one hypersensitivity has two phases1. Initial response# After first antigen exposure, this antigen is presented to CD-4 helper T ceils (TH2 type) by antigen presenting cells.These primed TH, cells release IL-4 that acts on B-cells to form Ig E specific for that particular antigen.The antigen specific Ig E antibodies then bind to the surface receptors of mast cells and basophils.The process from first antigen exposure to the coating of mast cells by Ig E acts as sensitization (prior sensitization) and first exposure is also called priming or sensitizing exposure (dose).Subsequent exposure {shocking dose) to same antigen then result in activation of mast cells and basophils with release of mediator from these cells that leads to -o Smooth muscle spasmo Increase mucus secretion from the epithelial cells,o Vasodilatationo Increased vascular permeabilityo Recuritment of inflammatory cellsNote - Most of the clinical effects are due to smooth muscle spasm.2) Late phase responseIn this phase additional leukocytes are recruited.These cells amplify and sustain the inflammatory response without additional exposure to the triggered antigen.Among the cells that are recruited in the late-phase reaction, eosinophils are particularly important.Eosinophils produce major basic protein and eosinophilic eataionic protein that are toxic to epithelial cells.Platelet activating factor (PAF) recruits and activates inflammatory cells and is most important cytokine in the inititiation of late phase response.o Type I hypersensitivity occurs in two forms :jAnaphvlaxis - Acute, potentially fatal, systemic. Atopy - Chronic, non-fataL localized.Remembero Mast cells are the most important cells in type I hypersensitivity.o Eosinophils are the most important cells in the late phase reaction of type l hypersensitivity.o Histamine is the most important mediator in type 1 hypersensitivity.o IL-4 is particularly important, it is essential for turning on IgE secreting B cells,o PAF is the most important cytokine in the initiation of late phase reaction,o Most potent eosinophilic activating cytokine is IL-5.",

If this produces agglutination of RBCs, the direct Coombs test is positive, a visual indication that antibodies (and/or complement proteins) are bound to the surface of red blood cells. The indirect Coombs test is used in prenatal testing of pregnant women and in testing blood prior to a blood transfusion. It detects antibodies against RBCs that are present unbound in the patient's serum. In this case, the rum is extracted from the blood sample taken from the patient. Then, the serum is incubated with RBCs of known antigenicity; that is, RBCs with known reference values from other patient blood samples.

The midpoint is called melting point (T J\" It is also defined as \"the temperature at which DNA Is half denatured# At this temperature, the absorbance of DNA at 260 nm is increased by 18.5% i.e. half of 37% increased in absorbance when DNA is completely denatured.

When ionic concentration is low this shielding is decreased, thus increasing the repulsive force b/w strands & reducing TmWhat is Annealing:Once the strands are separated they can be renatured. If the melted sample of DNA is slowly cooled the absorbance of the solution decreases. This is indicator of complementary strands being paired again. This process is called as annealing. Annealing can occur only at a temperature below Tm of DNA which is about 7GdegC. It is fastest at 20degC below (Tm) or 50degC.Application of Tm pf DNA# Amount of G & C (Guanine & Cytosine) in a genome (called \"GC content\") can be estimated by measuring the temperature at which the genomic DNA melts.

The J chain is a small glycopeptide that aids the polymerization of immunoglobulins. IgA exists as two subclasses: IgAI (75% of the total) and IgA2 (25% but more prevalent in secretions). IgA provides defense against local infections in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts, and prevents access of foreign substances to the general systemic immune system. It also can prevent virus binding to epithelial cells. IgM, not IgA, is the principal immunoglobulin in the primary immune response and is the usual antibody in cold agglutinins.

Fusion of lysosome Chediak higashi syndromeo It is an autosomal recessive disorder.o Chediak hi gash i syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene.o This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transport of materials into lysosomes.o Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins.o During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias.o Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome.Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation.o As a result, most people with chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infectionsr starting in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening,o Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected,o The other cells involved are -Melanosomes of melanocytesDense bodies of plateletsGranules of schwann cellso There are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells.o In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism i.e the colour of skin, hair and eye is reduced.o Abnormality' in platelets produce bleeding disorders.o Defective granules in schw ann cells lead to neurological symptoms e.g. peripheral neuropathy,o Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase (lymphoma like stage).o This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E.B. virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs,o The accelarated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure.

A deficiency of ADA results in an accumulation of adenosine, which is converted to its ribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide forms by cellular kinases. As dATP levels rise, ribonucleotide reductase is inhibited, thus preventing the production of all deoxyribose-containing nucleotides. Consequently, cells cannot make DNA and divide. In its most severe form, this autosomal recessive disorder causes a type of severe combined immunodeficiency disease, involving a decrease in both T cells and B cells. It is estimated that in the United States, ADA deficiency accounts for approximately 14% of all cases of SCID. Treatment requires either bone marrow' replacement or enzyme replacement therapy.

The problem exists in a mutational defect in the CD40 ligand in CD4-positive helper T cells, leading to failure of normal interaction between this ligand on T cells and CD40 on B-cell surfaces.

RE can produce 'sticky' and 'blunt1 ends.# Analysis of RFLP variation is an important tool in genomic mapping, localization of genetic disease, determination of risk for a disease, genetic fingerprinting, and paternity testing.# It is the sequence that makes DNA different, obtained from different sources, and RFLP analysis is a technique that can identify differences in the sequence (when they occur in a restriction site).# The basic technique for detecting RFLPs involves fragmenting a sample of DNA by restriction enzymes, which can recognize and cut DNA wherever a specific short sequence occurs, by a process known as a restriction digest. The resulting DNA fragments are then separated by length through a process known as agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to membrane via the Southern blot procedure. Hybridization of the membrane to a labelled DNA probe then determines the size of the fragments which are complementary to the probe. An RFLP occurs when the size of a detected fragment varies between individuals. Each fragment size is considered an allele, and can be used in genetic analysis.Table (Harrison 17th/406): Methods Used for the Detection of MutationsMathodPrincipleType of Mutation DetextedCommonly Used TechniquesCytogeneticanalysisUnique visual appearance of various chromosomesNumerical or structural abnormalities in chromosomesFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)Hybridization to chromosomes with fluonescently labeled probesNumerical or structural abnormalities in chromosomesSouthern blotHybridization with genomic probe or cDNA probe after digestion of high molecular DNALarge deletion, insertion, rearrangement, expansions of triplet repeat, amplification MathodPrincipleType of Mutation DetctedCommonly Used TechniquesPolymerase chain reaction (PCR)Amplification of DNAsegmentExpansion of triplet repeats, variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), gene rearrangements, translocations; prepare DNA for other mutation methodsReverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)QReverse transcription, amplification of DNA segment - absence or reduction of mRNA transcriptionAnalyze expressed mRNA (cDNA) sequence; detect loss of expressionDNA sequencingDirect sequencing of PCR productsPoint mutations, small deletions and insertions Sequencing of DNA segments cloned into plasmid vectors Restriction fragment polymorphism [RFLP) QDetection of altered restriction pattern of genomic DNA (Southern blot) or PCR productsPoint mutations, small deletions and inser - tionsQ",

Pathogenesis & Control of Viral Diseases > Table 30-7See APPENDIX-19 for list of \"CYTOKINES\"Synthesis of InterferonsInterferons are produced by all vertebrate species. Normal cells do not generally synthesize interferon until they are induced to do so. Infection with viruses is a potent insult leading to induction; RNA viruses are stronger inducers of interferon than DNA viruses. Interferons also can be induced by double-stranded RNA, bacterial endotoxin, and small molecules such as tilorone. IFN-g is not produced in response to most viruses but is induced by mitogen stimulation.The different classes of interferon are produced by different cell types. IFN-a and IFN-b are synthesized by many cell types, but IFN-g is produced mainly by lymphocytes, especially T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Dendritic cells are potent interferon producers; under the same virus challenge conditions, dendritic cells can secrete up to l000x more interferon than fibroblasts.

The Foxn1 gene is the single most impoant gene for the thymic organogenesis for development of thymic epithelial cells. Because they lack a thymus, nude mice cannot generate mature T lymphocytes. Therefore they are unable to mount many types of adaptive immune responses, including antibody formation that requires CD4+ helper T cell; cell-mediated immune responses, which require CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells; delayed-type hypersensitivity responses (require CD4+ T cells); killing of virus-infected or malignant cells (requires CD8+ cytotoxic cells); graft rejection (requires both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) These mice possess a vestigial thymus which is incapable of producing mature T-cells as shown by a decreased lymphocyte population carrying the theta antigen and depleted &;thymus-dependent&; areas in their peripheral lympoid organs. However, they have T-cell prescursors in their bone marrow. Nude mice lack &;Thymosin&;, a factor secreted by the epithelial cells of the thymus. The phenotype (main outward appearance) of the mouse is a lack of body hair, which gives it the \"nude\" nickname. The nude mouse is valuable to research because it can receive many different types of tissue and tumor grafts, as it mounts no rejection response.

The hybrid cell which is thus produced can be cloned to produce large number of identical daughter clones.o These daughter clone cells then produce antibodies. Since these antibodies come from only one type of cell {hybridoma cell) they are called monoclonal antibodies.o HAT (hypoxanthine, Aminopterin and thymidine) medium is used for preparation of monoclonal antibodies because it allows only fused hybridoma cells to grow. It does not allow the unfused myeloma and unfused antibody cells to grow. So HAT medium is a selective medium which allows (which allow selective growth offused hybridoma)How does this happen ?o Before we move on with the discussion, remember these few points about purine synthesis.o Purine synthesis is essential for the survival of cells.Purine can be synthesized in two way i.e.De novo synthesis (dihydrofolate reductase enzyme is required for this pathway).Salvage pathway (an enzyme hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyl transferase is required for salvage pathways)o Myeloma cells lack HGPRTase enzyme therefore they cannot synthesize purine by salvage pathways,o Antibody cells have HGPRTase enzyme so they can use the salvage pathways,o Aminopterin inhibits dihydrofolate reductase an enzyme used in denovo synthesis of purineo When two cell lines i.e. antibody producing cell and myeloma cells are grown in HAT medium only the fused hybridoma cells survive.Myeloma cells die because they lack the enzyme HGPRTase so they cannot use the salvage pathways for purine synthesis. They also cannot use de-novo pathway, because Aminopterin present in the HAT medium inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (an enzyme essential for denovo synthesis ofpurine).o The unfused antibody producing cells die as they cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span,o Only fused hybridoma cells grow indefinitely because the antibody cell partner supplies HGPRTase and the myeloma partner gives it immortality, (as it is a cancer cell)",

The diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis can be made in 80 to 90% of cases by demonstration of heterophil antibodies. In the heterophil-negative cases and for atypical infections, determination of specific antibodies to EBV are useful in establishing the diagnosis. The development of IgM antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (EBV-VCA Ab) can be used for specific diagnosis of a current or recent infection. They arise early in the disease and persist for only 4 to 8 weeks On the other hand, many adults have been exposed to EBV and maintain a low level of IgG in response to this virus. A titer of greater than 1:640 is usually diagnostic Antibodies to the early antigen of EBV (EA-EBV) show two distinct patterns of fluorescence-diffuse staining of both nuclei and cytoplasm (anti-D) and staining of cytoplasmic aggregates (anti-R). Anti-D titers appear 3 to 4 weeks after onset and are present in 70% of EBV-induced mononucleosis. Titers correlate with the severity of clinical illness and disappear after recovery. Anti-R titers appear two weeks to several months after onset and are rarely seen in cases of infectious mononucleosis. They are detectable in atypical cases and remain so for up to two years Antibodies to the nuclear antigen of EBV (EBNA-Ab) appear three to four weeks after onset and persist for life. They are useful in assessing recent infection if patients are VCA-positive, EBNA-negative, and then become EBNA-positive.

However, if too many antibodies are present that can bind to the antigen, then the antigenic sites are coated by antibodies, and few or no antibodies directed toward the pathogen are able to bind more than one antigenic paicle. Since the antibodies do not bridge between antigens, no agglutination occurs. Because no agglutination occurs, the test is interpreted as negative. In this case, the result is a false negative. The range of relatively high antibody concentrations within which no reaction occurs is called the prozone. Examples include high levels of syphilis antibodies in HIV patients or high levels of cryptococcal antigen leading to false negative tests in undiluted samples.

        "exp": "A virgin B-cell bears IgM (and possibly IgD) in its membrane; following stimulation it begins to secrete IgM into its surrounding environment. The difference between the two forms of IgM is entirely at the C-terminus. The ms (secreted) chain has a hydrophilic peptide additional to the Cm4 domain and the mm (membrane-bound) chain has a hydrophobic peptide replacing the former which anchors the molecule into the membrane. The membrane-bound form of IgM is also incapable of associating with J-chain and forming its normal pentameric structure; membrane IgM, therefore, exists exclusively in monomeric form (H2L2), also known as IgMS or \"sub-unit\" IgM. Difference arises because the ms and mm chains are translated from distinct mRNA molecules that are generated by alternative splicing and/or termination points of transcripts from a single rearranged m gene. Similar differences exist for secreted versus membrane-bound forms of IgG, IgA and IgE heavy chains. The immunoglobulin gene encodes both membrane-associated and secreted proteins through alternative RNA processing reactions. The regulatory mechanisms governing alternative RNA processing involves gene coding for competing cleavage-polyadenylation and RNA splicing reactions and the relative use of the two pathways is differentially regulated between B cells and plasma cells. General cleavage-polyadenylation and RNA splicing reactions are both altered during B cell maturation to affect immunoglobulin expression. Not the others options due to following points... Each B cell is known to express a unique combination of immunoglobulin chains, where each V-J and V-D-J recombination is different. A single productive rearrangement of each type occurs in a given lymphocyte to produce one light and one heavy chain gene. Because each event involves the expression of genes of only one homologous chromosome, the alleles on the other homologous chromosome is not expressed in this same cell. This is called allelic exclusion. Assembly of the light and heavy chains during reaarangement of the variable region of immunoglobulins involves the mechanism indicated by the presence of conserved sequences at the boundaries of all germ line segments that paicipate in joining reactions. Each conserved sequence consist of a palindromic hepatamer called recombination signal sequences (RSS). These act as facilitators of recombination process. These sequences correspond to one or two turns of DNA helix accordingly called one turn or two turn signal sequences Class switching is a process by which on antigenic stimulation, the H chain VDJ unit can join any constant heavy gene segment and express the paicular antibody class.

HLA complex of genes is located on the short arm of chromosome 6.o HLA complex consists of three separate clusters of genes :-1) Class I (MHC-I)# It comprising of A,B and C loci (i.e. HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C).

A variety of supports can be used, such as polystyrene microdilution plates, paddles, plastic beads, and tubes. The number of layers in the antibody-antigen sandwich varies; usually as additional layers are added, detection sensitivity is increased. The two most common enzymes are horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). b-Galactosidase has also been employed. O-phenylenediamine is the most common substrate for HRP and b-nitrophenyl phosphate for AP.
