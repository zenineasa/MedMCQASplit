This antibody blocks hemolysis by streptolysin 0.This phenomenon forms the basis of a quantitative test for the antibody. An antistreptolysin O (ASO) serum titer in excess of160-200 units is considered abnormally high and suggests either recent infection with S pyogenes or persistently high antibody levels due to an exaggerated immune response to an earlier exposure in a hypersensitive person.Streptolysin S is the agent responsible for the hemolytic zones around streptococcal colonies growing on the surface of blood agar plates. It is elaborated in the presence of serum--hence the name streptolysin S. It is not antigenic, but it may be inhibited by a nonspecific inhibitor that is frequently present in the sera of humans and animals and is independent of past experience with streptococci.",

The most common and usual cause is acute pharyngitis.o Infection is the most common cause of sore throat and etiological agents are usually respiratory viruseso The causes are -# Viral pharyngitis (70%) The most common being rhinovirus (40%) followed by coronavirus (10-20%), adenovirus (10%), herpesvirus (8%) and other virus (< 5%) like influenza, parainfluenza, EBV etc.# Streptococcal pharyngitis (20-30%) This is the most common bacterial cause.# Other causesH. influenzae, pneumococcus etc.o For diagnosis, the throat culture is performed by culturing the swab for bacteria collected from the back of throat. The bacteria are allowed to grow on special plates called sheep blood agar plateo However, throat culture takes 1 -2 days. Therefore, more rapid test, i.e. rapid antigen test (Quick test) can be used early if suspecting bacterial pharyngitis.",
