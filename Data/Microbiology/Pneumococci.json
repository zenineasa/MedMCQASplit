Inoculated mice will die within 1 -3 days and pneumococci may be isolated from peritoneal fluid or heart blood. This will be negative with avirulent strains e.g., type 14.Other tests employed are:1) Gram stain - gram positive, lanceolate diplococcic2) Sputum culture in blood agar3) Blood culture - isolation from blood indicates bad prognosis4) CSF - Gram staining and cultureDemonstration of SSS by precipitation5) Capsular polysaccharide - Quellung reaction, counter immune electrophoresis",
