The material is inoculated onto special solid media and incubated for 3-10 days at 37degC with 5% CO2 (under microaerophilic conditions), or into special broth and incubated aerobically. One or two transfers of media may be necessary before growth appears that is suitable for microscopic examination by staining or immunofluorescence. Colonies may have a \"Fried Egg\" appearance on agar.",
