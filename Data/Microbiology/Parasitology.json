Definitive host: Dogs/foxes/other canines.(Dog is the principle definitive host) Embryonated eggs are passed in the feces of Definitive host. Eggs ingested by intermediate host (sheep, cattle, Goat, swine). Intermediate hosts for the parasite, enable the worms to develop, but not to pass infectious eggs. Eggs ingested by Accidental host (humans). Accidental intermediate hosts also enable the worms to develop, but not to pass infectious eggs. They fuher usually represent dead end for the parasite. Egg shell disintegrates (Egg hatches) and each egg released &;an embryo&; called \"Oncosphere\" Oncosphere penetrates intestinal wall and enters blood strain where it is distributed to various tissues (Liver/Lung/Brain) Once the Oncosphere arrive in their end organs they gradually develop into fluid filled cysts called Hydatid cysts. Hydatid cysts represent parasitic larval stages in their viscera. The innermost layer of the Hydatid cyst contains germinal membrane from which offsprings will bud. The offsprings are called protoscolices because they contain the hooklets and suckers found in the scolex of adult however, the protoscolices are folded in upon themselves.(\"invaginated\") No fuher development happens in the intermediate hosts.

Larva Migrans: The life cycle of most parasites include migration of larvae through various tissues and organs of the body. When such larvae are not able to complete their journey through host&;s tissue to reach localization in their normal abode, their normal progress is arrested and they may localize in unexpected tissue or organs. This condition is called larvae migrans and is generally seen when human infection occurrs with nonhuman species of nematodes. According to the mode of entrance and localization two type of larva migrans are recognized: Cutaneous Larva Migrans (Creeping eruption) Visceral Larva Migrans Caused by larvae that enter by skin penetration Ancylostoma (most common) Strongyloides stercoralis Ectopic infection with Fasciola & Paragonimus Caused by larvae that enter by oral route Toxocara canis (dog ascarid) Toxocara cati (cat ascarid) Anisakis (Anisakiasis) Gnathostoma (Gnathostomiasis) Transient creeping eruptions may also caused by Nector Americanus, Gnathostomiasis, Sparaganosis Creeping miasis may be caused by flies of genus Hypoderma & Gastrophillus.

The worms lie threaded into the caecal mucosa and even though it is not a blood feeder, oozing of blood may occur at the sites of attachment. The blood loss is about 0.005 ml per worm per day. Over a period of time this may lead to anaemia and malnutrition. It has been suggested that mechanical blockage of the appendiceal lumen by masses of whipworms may cause acute appendicitis. In heavy infection, the worm may be abundant on the colonic mucosa, even upto the rectum. Mucus diarrhoea, chronic dysentery and abdominal pain are frequently seen in such cases.

Excystment takes place in the small intestine and the liberated trophozoites reach the large intestine where they feed and multiply as lumen commensals. Infection is very often confined to the lumen and is asymptomatic. Clinical disease results only when the trophozoites burrow into the intestinal mucosa, set up colonies and initiate inflammatory reaction. This leads to mucosal ulcers and submucosal abscesses resembling the lesions in amoebiasis. Clinically also, balantidiasis resembles amoebiasis, causing diarrhoea or frank dysentery with abdominal colic, tenesmus, nausea and vomiting. Occasionally there may occur intestinal perforation with peritonitis and rarely involvement of genital and urinary tracts. Diagnosis Diagnosis is established by demonstration of the parasite in faeces. While motile trophozoites occur in diarrhoeic faeces, cysts are found in formed stools.

The resurgence of an erythrocytic infection (relapse) occurs when merozoites from hypnozoites in the liver break out, are not phagocytosed in the bloodstream, and succeed in reestablishing a red cell infection. Without treatment, P vivax and P ovale infections may persist as periodic relapses for up to 5 years. Human infection results from the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito, through which the sporozoites are injected into the bloodstream. Parasitized red cells are enlarged in P.ovale, P.malariae P vivax, P malariae, and P ovale parasitemias are a relatively low grade, primarily because the parasites our either young or old red cells but not both. P falciparum invades red cells of all ages, including the erythropoietic stem cells in bone marrow, so parasitemia may be very high. P falciparum also causes parasitized red cells to adhere to the endothelial lining of blood vessels, with resulting obstruction, thrombosis, and local ischemia. P falciparum infections are therefore far more serious than the others, with a much higher rate of severe and frequently fatal complications (cerebral malaria, malarial hyperpyrexia, gastrointestinal disorders, algid malaria, blackwater fever).

        "exp": "Schizogony in the Human Host: Man is the intermediate host for malaria, wherein the asexual phase of the life cycle occurs. The sporozoites inoculated by the infested mosquito initiate this phase of the cycle from the liver, and the latter pa continues within the red blood cells, which results in the various clinical manifestations of the disease. Pre-erythrocytic Phase - Schizogony in the Liver: With the mosquito bite, tens to a few hundred invasive sporozoites are introduced into the skin. Following the intradermal deposition, some sporozoites are destroyed by the local macrophages, some enter the lymphatics, and some others find a blood vessel. The sporozoites that enter a lymphatic vessel reach the draining lymph node wherein some of the sporozoites paially develop into exoerythrocytic stages and may also prime the T cells to mount a protective immune response. The sporozoites that find a blood vessel reach the liver within a few hours. It has recently been shown that the sporozoites travel by a continuous sequence of stick-and-slip motility, using the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) family and an actin-myosin motor. The sporozoites then negotiate through the liver sinusoids, and migrate into a few hepatocytes, and then multiply and grow within parasitophorous vacuoles. Each sporozoite develop into a schizont containing 10,000-30,000 merozoites (or more in case of P. falciparum). The growth and development of the parasite in the liver cells is facilitated by a a orable environment created by the The circumsporozoite protein of the parasite. The entire pre-eryhrocytic phase lasts about 5-16 days depending on the parasite species: on an average 5-6 days for P. falciparum, 8 days for P. vivax, 9 days for P. ovale, 13 days for P. malariae and 8-9 days for P. knowlesi. The pre-erythrocytic phase remains a \"silent\" phase, with little pathology and no symptoms, as only a few hepatocytes are affected. This phase is also a single cycle, unlike the next, erythrocytic stage, which occurs repeatedly.",

        "exp": "CLONORCHIS SINENSIS Commonly known as the Chinese liver fluke, Embryonated eggs are discharged in the biliary ducts and in the stool . Eggs are ingested by a suitable snail intermediate host . Each egg releases a miracidia , which go through several developmental stages (sporocysts , rediae , and cercariae ). The cercariae are released from the snail and after a sho period of free-swimming time in water, they come in contact and penetrate the flesh of freshwater fish, where they encyst as metacercariae . Infection of humans occurs by ingestion of undercooked, salted, pickled, or smoked freshwater fish . After ingestion, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum and ascend the biliary tract through the ampulla of Vater . Maturation takes approximately 1 month. The adult flukes (measuring 10 to 25 mm by 3 to 5 mm) reside in small and medium sized biliary ducts. In addition to humans, carnivorous animals can serve as reservoir hosts. The migration of the larva up the bile duct induces desquamation, followed by hyperplasia and sometimes adenomatous changes. The smaller bile ducts undergo cystic dilatation. The adult worm may cause obstruction and blockage of the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. Chronic infection may result in calculus formation. A few cases go on to biliary cirrhosis and poal hypeension. Some patients with chronic clonorchiasis tend to become biliary carriers of typhoid bacilli. Chronic infection has also been linked with cholangiocarcinoma. Patients in the early stage have fever, epigastric pain, diarrhoea and tender hepatomegaly.

Hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy also occur but are not so prominent. The hair becomes thin and brittle. Epistaxis and bleeding gums are common. Most untreated patients die in about 2 years due to some intercurrent disease such as dysentery or tuberculosis. About 10 to 20 per cent of pateints who recover develop post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). The dermal lesions usually develop about a year or two after recovery from the systemic illness. The lesions are of 3 types--depigmented macules which appear commonly on the trunk and extremities, or erythematous patches appearing on the face (butterfly patch), both of which develop into painless yellowish pink non-ulcerating granulomatous nodules. The parasite can be demonstrated in the lesions.",

The infective larvae deposited in the skin by the bite of the vector develop at the site to adult worms. Adult worms are seen singly, in pairs or in tangled masses in subcutaneous tissues. They may occur in the subcutaneous nodules or free in the tissues. The subcutaneous nodule or onchocercoma is a circumscribed, firm, non-tender tumour formed as a result of fibroblastic reaction around the worms. Nodules vary in size from a few mm to about 10 cm. They tend to occur over anatomical sites where the bones are superficial, such as the scalp,scapulae, ribs, elbows, iliac crest, sacrum and knees. The nodules are painless and cause no trouble except for their unsightly appearance. Microfilariae cause lesions in the skin and eyes. The skin lesion is a dermatitis with pruritus, pigmentation, atrophy and fibrosis. Ocular manifestations range from photophobia to gradual blurring of vision, progressing to total blindness. Ocular lesions include punctate or sclerosing keratitis, iridocyclitis, secondary glaucoma, choroidoretinitis and optic atrophy.

        "exp": "Xenodiagnosis is used in the diagnosis of Chagas disease, which is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a hemoflagellate. There are four morphologic forms of hemoflagellates. In man, they may be intracellular, in which they are called leishmanial forms; or, they may be located extracellularly in the blood, in which they are called trypanosomes. The insect vectors may have leptomonads (promastigotes) or crithidial (epimastigote) forms. Leishmaniasis (cutaneous, mucocutaneous/and visceral) only has the leishmania, intracellular forms present in man. In Mrican trypanosomiasis, only the extracellular, or trypanosomal form, is present in man. Chagas disease has both the intracellular (leishmanial) and extracellular (trypanosomal) forms. Chagas disease is rampant in South America and is the major cause of progressive hea failure and death in that area. T cruzi is a flagellated protozoan that is transmitted to man by the bite of the Reduviid bug, or kissing bug, which usually occurs during the night. Sholy after the bite, the bug defecates on the wound site and the sleeping host rubs the organisms into the wound. Periorbital inflammation develops, which is called Romana's sign. Trypanosomes circulate in the blood and leishmanial forms invade (1) the reticuloendothelial cells, producing hepatosplenomegaly; (2) the hea muscle, causing myocarditis and arrhythmias; (3) the brain, producing a meningoencephalitis; and (4) into the gastrointestinal tract, where the leishmania destroy the ganglion cells in the distal esophagus and rectum to produce acquired achalasia and Hirschsprung disease, respectively. Laboratory diagnosis is made by (1) finding trypanosomes in the blood, (2) finding leishmanial forms in tissue, (3) culture, (4) serology, and (5) xenodiagnosis. Xenodiagnosis is a method of inoculation in which sterile Reduviid bugs are fed or offered the blood of an infected patient. After a few weeks, the bug's intestinal contents are examined for presence or absence of the organism. Only 5% of patients die in the acute stage of hea failure, whereas in chronic disease, hea failure is a common cause of death. Nifuimox is the drug of choice.",

        "exp": "STRONGYLOIDES The clinical disease may be classified as cutaneous, pulmonary and intestinal. The overwhelming severe disease seen in the immunocompromised is known as hyperinfection. Cutaneous There may be a dermatitis, with erythema and itching at the site of penetration of the filariform larvae, paicularly when large numbers of larvae enter the skin. In those sensitised by prior infection, there may be an allergic response. This may prevent circulation in the blood of the larvae, which may instead migrate in skin, leading to a form of creeping eruption or larva migrans. Pulmonary During escape of the larvae from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli, small haemorrhages occur, along with cellular infiltration into alveoli and bronchioles. Larvae may be found in the sputum. Intestinal The symptoms may resemble those of peptic ulcer or of malabsorption syndrome. Mucus diarrhoea is often present. In heavy infection, the mucosa may be honeycombed with the worm and there may be extensive sloughing, causing dysenteric stools. Hyperinfection In debilitated individuals, and paicularly in those with cellular immune defects, extensive internal reinfection takes place, leading to enormous numbers of adult worms in the intestines and lungs, and larvae in various tissues and organs. This is known as hyperinfection. Severe malnutrition, lepromatous leprosy, lymphoreticular malignancies, AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs and other situations in which cellmediated immunity is defective, predispose to this condition. Hyperinfection is an impoant hazard of steroid therapy and other instances of prolonged immunosuppression as in tansplant patients. Manifestations depend on the sites affected.

Within half an hour of ingestion, the cyst hatches out into two trophozoites which multiply successively by binary fission and colonise the duodenum. The trophozoites as they pass down the colon develop into cysts. G. lamblia is seen typically within the crypts in the duodenum. It does not invade tissues, but remains tightly attached by means of the sucking disc to the epithelial surface in the duodenum and jejunum.

The fluid is cloudy to purulent, with prominent neutrophil leucocytosis, elevated proteins and low glucose, resembling pyogenic meningitis. Failure to find bacteria in such specimens should raise the possibility of PAM. Wet film examination of CSF may show the trophozoites. Cysts are never seen CSF or brain. At autopsy, trophozoites can be demonstrated in brain histologically.Culture can be obtained in agar seeded with Escherichia coli or in the usual cell cultures used for virus isolation.
