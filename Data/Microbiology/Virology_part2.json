H-17th/114l; Figure 182-5).HIV Genome - Like other retroviruses, HIV-1 has genes that encode the structural proteins of the virus:# gog encodes the proteins that form the core of the virion (including p24 antigen);# pol encodes enzymes responsible for protease processing of viral proteins, reverse transcription, & integration;# env encodes the envelope glycoproteins.HIV-1 is more complex than other retroviruses, in that it also contains at least six other genes (tat, rev, nef vif vpr, and vpu), which code for proteins involved in the modification of the host cell to enhance virus growth and the regulation of viral gene expression. Several of these proteins are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV disease. Flanking these genes are the long terminal repeats (LTRs), which contain regulatory elements involved in gene expression.The major difference between the genomes of HIV-1 and HIV-2 is the fact that HIV-2 lacks the vpu gene and has a vpx gene not contained in HIV-1.LTR: Long terminal repeat# Contains control regions that bind host transcription factors (NF-kB, NFAT, Sp.l, TBP).# Required for the initiation of transcription# Contains RNA trans-acting response element (TAR) that binds tat.vif: Viral infectivity factor (p23)# Overcomes inhibitory effects of APOBEC, preventing hypermutation and viral DNA degradation.vpu: Viral protein U# Promotes CD4 degradation and influences virion releasenef: Negative effector (p27)# Promotes downregulation of surface CD4 and MHC 1 expression# Blocks apoptosis# Enhances virion infectivity# Alters state of cellular activation# Progression to disease slowed significantly in absence of NE.vpr: Viral protein R (pl5)# Promotes G2 cell-cycle arrest# Facilitates HIV infection of macrophages.rev: Regulator of viral gene expression (pl9)# Binds RRE# Inhibits viral RNA splicing and promotes nuclear export of incompletely spliced viral RNAs.tat: Transcriptional activator (pl4)# Binds TAR# In presence of host cyclin T1 and CDK9 enhances RNA Pol II elongation on the viral DNA template.gag: Pr55gag# Polyprotein processed by PR MA, matrix (pi7)# Undergoes myristylation that helps target gag polyprotein to lipid rafts;# CA, capsid (p24) binds cyclophilin A NC, nucleocapsid (p7) Zn finger, RNA-binding protein p6# Interacts with Vpr; contains late domain (PTAP) that binds TSG101 and participates in terminal stops of virion budding.pol: Polymerase# Encodes a variety of viral enzymes, including PR (plO), RT, and RNAase H (p66/51), and IN (p32) all processed by PR.env: gp 160 envelope protein# Cleaved in endoplasmic reticulum to gpl20 (SU) and gp41 (TM)# gpl20 mediates CD4 and chemokine receptor binding, while gp41 mediates fusion# Contains RNA response element (RRE) that binds Rev.",

This accompanied by a decrease in reticulocyte count and hemoglobin, which is not usually noticed in healthy children and adults. The second phase begins a week later when virus-specific IgG antibody appears and includes the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" appearance and lacy reticular rash. Adults often develop polyarthropathy or arthralgia. The rash and arthropathy are due to circulating antigen-antibody complexes.

The virus is therefore called varicella zoster virus (VZA).* Primary infection with VZV causes chicken pox.* Reactivation of latent VZV, when immunity has fallen to ineffective levels causes-Herpes zoster* The virus remains dormant in sensory ganglion of trigeminal nerve and reaches the eye along one or morebranches of the opthalmic division of the 5th nerve.Chicken pox* The causative agent of chicken pox is Varicella - Zoster virus (Herpes simplex type III).* It is an acute respiratory infection with incubation period 10-21 days.* Infection is acquired through respiratory tract via air droplets or rarely from conjunctiva.* Infectious period (communicable period) for chicken pox is 2 days prior to 5 days after onset of rash, with a very high secondary attack rate of 90%.* Chicken-pox usually affects children of age group 5-9 years.* Clinical features of chicken pox has two stages1) Pre-eruptive stage# Characterized by fever, back pain, malaise and shivering.2) Eruptive stage# It is characterized by a characteristic rash with following features (which must be differentiated from rash of small pox)i) Superficial and unilocular (rash of small pox is deep seated and multilocular).ii) Symmetrical, mostly on flexor surface (rash of small-pox usually affect extensor surface).iii) Centripetal distribution (rash of smallpox has centrifugal distribution).iv) Affects axilla but spares palms and soles (rash of small-pox affects palms and soles but spares axilla).v) Pleomorphic, with appearance of all stages of rash simultaneously (rash is mon-omorphic in nature in small-pox).vi) Dew-drop on rose petal apperance (rash of small-pox has umblicated apperarance).vii) Area of inflammation around the rash (in small-pox there is no inflammation around the rash).viii) Evolution of rash is rapid, scabs begin to form 4-7 days after rash (evolution is slow, scabs begin 10-14 days after rash).* Though the disease affects children commonly, it is more severe in adults than in children.* Most common complication of varicella is secondary bacterial infection of skin, usually caused by streptococci or staphylococci. The most common extracutoneous site of involvement in children is CNS. Varicella pneumonia is the most serious complication following chicken - pox in adults. Important complications of chicken pox are:-i) Pulmonary: Pneumoniaii) CNS: Cerebellar ataxia, encephalitis, meningitis, GB syndrome, Transverse myelitis.iii) Others : Myocarditis, Nephritis, arthritis, hepatitis, corneal lesions, thrombocytopenia, bleeding diasthesis.* Latent infection is established in cranial nerve, sensory ganglia and spinal dorsal root ganglia.

The most common extracutoneous site of involvement in children is CNS. Varicella pneumonia is the most serious complication following chicken - pox in adults. Important complications of chicken pox are:-i) Pulmonary: Pneumoniaii) CNS: Cerebellar ataxia, encephalitis, meningitis, GB syndrome, Transverse myelitis.iii) Others: Myocarditis, Nephritis, arthritis, hepatitis, corneal lesions, thrombocytopenia, bleeding diasthesis.* Latent infection is established in cranial nerve, sensory ganglia and spinal dorsal root ganglia.

In lysogenic cycle, it gets inserted only between the genes determining galactose utilization and biotin utilization due to the presence of site specific recombinase.b. On induction of the lytic cycle, the integration is reversed and the phage genome is excised at the same site as the integration.c. Occasionally, however, excision process occurs between two sites other than the normal attachment regions of the phage and host DNA, usually one within the prophage and one just outside. The consequence is that a ring of DNA is excised that contains primarily of lambda genes and a few host genes from either side of the attachment site. This hybrid DNA can be packaged in a lambda head and released, where it is able to infect a further cell and inject into it DNA that contains some host genes. This is an example of specialized transduction.",

        "exp": "The advent of triple therapy or a therapeutic \"cocktail\" has had a marked effect on AIDS patients. The combination of drugs work together as reverse transcriptive inhibitors and a protease inhibitor. Patients improve rapidly, their CD4 lymphocyte counts increase, and their HIV viral load is drastically reduced, often to <50 copies per ml. On the other hand, an untreated HIVpositive patient with a low CD4 and a high viral load a) is at increased risk of oppounistic infection and b) has a much greater chance of developing AIDS than if the viral load was <50,000. The patient is infectious and his HIV antibody screening test will be positive. The high viral load, however, is not a predictor of response to therapy. Many patients with high viral loads do very well on triple therapy, although resistance to one or more of the agents may subsequently occur. A low CD4 count does not predict progression to AIDS but does indicate increased chance of oppounistic infection such as those listed. Kaposi's sarcoma, which has been linked to herpesvirus type 8, pneumocystis, and mycobacterial disease are three of the most prevalent oppounistic infections. While HIV-positive patients contract pneumococcal pneumonia, they are probably at no more risk than the general population, as protection against pneumococcal disease is linked to the presence of anticapsular antibody.

The physician observes disseminated lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and a rash on the man's upper chest. The patient states that he had been to a party 2 weeks ago where he experimented with injecting drugs to get high. Needles were shared among the party-goers. A rapid latex test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies performed in the physician's office is negative. The doctor has a strong suspicion that this man has acute retroviral syndrome. Which of the following tests is most likely to support a diagnosis of HIV infection at this time?",
        "exp": "Reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR for HIV RNA (d) has recently been shown to be the most valuable test for diagnosis of acute HIV infection (acute retroviral syndrome) during the window period before antibodies can be detected. This qualitative test for detection of HIV virions is positive at the time symptoms of acute infection appear, as early as 7 days post infection; the test is also positive in asymptomatic individuals and is used to screen donated blood. The test for HIV p24 antigen (c) is the next to become positive, 17 to 38 days after infection. Antibodies appear last at 21 to 42 days (3 to 6 weeks) post infection. While there is some difference in the time to positivity of the various types of HIV antibody tests, the HIV antibody test by ELISA (b) would be no more likely to be positive this early than the latex aggregation test. The western blot for HIV antibodies (e) is used to confirm positive screening tests for antibodies. The CD4 T-cell count (a) is used to assess status of the immune system, determine the timing for treatment, suggest the likelihood of onset of various opportunistic infections, and monitor progress response of the immune system to treatment. The count is unlikely to be decreased at 2 weeks post infection although a drop does coincide with the peak of viremia.",

Few persons who lack P antigen cannot be infected with B19.# Most commonly occurs as outbreaks of erythema infectiosum in schools during winter and spring months.Clinical Manifestations# Erythema Infectiosum- Erythema infectiosum is the most common manifestation of B19 and occurs in children (winter and spring).- Called fifth disease as it was classified in late 19th century as the fifth in a series of six exanthems of childhood.- Normally a mild illness, erythema infectiosum typically presents as a facial rash with a \"slapped-cheek\" appearance that is sometimes preceded by low-grade fever. Rash resolves in about a week but can recur.# Arthropathy- B19 infection in adults most commonly presents as acute arthritis (symmetric and peripheral), with rash.- It normally resolves in about 3 weeks and is nondestructive.# Transient Aplastic Crisis, pure red-cell aplasia and Chronic Anemia in Immunodeficient Patients.# Fetal and Congenital Infection- It is estimated that fewer than 10% of maternal B19 infections in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy lead to fetal death; usually attributable to the development of nonimmune hydrops fetalis.# Possible Clinical Associations- with several rheumatic diseases, most notably rheumatoid arthritis but also vasculitis (including polyarteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, and giant cell arteritis), lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is noted. Other associations include those involving multiple systems: cardiac (myocarditis), hematologic (hemophagocytic syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura), hepatic (fulminant hepatitis), neurologic (meningoencephalitis), renal (glomerulonephritis), and respiratory (pneumonia).Diagnosis# Diagnosis most commonly relies on measurements of B 19-specific IgM and IgG antibodies.Rx# Erythema infectiosum and arthropathy usually requires no treatment.# Transient aplastic crisis is usually treated with erythrocyte transfusions.# In immunodeficient anemic patients, B19 infection should be treated with iv Igs.# Prophylaxis of B19 infection with immunoglobulin should be considered for patients with chronic hemolysis or immunodeficiency and for pregnant women.Also know:# Medically vital DNA viruses: parvoviruses, papovaviruses (e.g., HPVs, polyomaviruses), Adeno, Herpes, and Pox.",

The \"Australia antigen,\" discovered in 1960, was first renamed hepatitis-associated antigen (HAA) and then, finally, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It appears in the blood early after infection, before onset of acute illness, and persists through early convalescence. HBsAg usually disappears within 4 to 6 months after the start of clinical illness except in the case of chronic carriers.Hepatitis B 37 antigen (HBeAg) appears during the early acute phase and disappears before HBsAg is gone, although it may persist in the chronic carrier. Persons who are HBeAg-positive have higher titers of HBV and therefore are at a higher risk of transmitting the disease. HBeAg has a high correlation with DNA polymerase activity.The hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is found within the nuclei of infected hepatocytes and not generally in the peripheral circulation except as an integral component of the Dane particle. The antibody to this antigen, anti-HBc, is present at the beginning of clinical illness. As long as there is ongoing HBV replication, there will be high titers of anti-HBc. During the early convalescent phase of an HBV infection, anti-HBc may be the only detectable serologic marker (window phase) if HBsAg is negative and anti-HBsAg has not appeared.",

Detection of anti-HAV IgM in a single serum specimen obtained in the acute or convalescent stage is the quickest and most reliable method to diagnose hepatitis A infection. This antibody is usually present at onset of symptoms and may persist 3 to 6 months. Demonstration of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in serum is the most common method of diagnosing HBV infection. Other serologic markers helpful in characterizing infection with HBV include hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc), anti-hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that immune serum globulin (ISG) can prevent clinical hepatitis A even when given up to 10 days after exposure. Similar studies have shown that ISG was able to decrease the incidence of hepatitis B infection in exposed persons. Purified, noninfectious HBsAg derived from healthy HBsAg carriers has been used as a vaccine for active immunization for HBV infection. Hepatitis C is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae. The viral reservoir is human. Recent retrospective \"lookbacks\" suggest that many people were infected with HCV before testing of the blood supply was initiated in the early 1990s. HCV is treatable with combinations of drugs. The genotype of the virus plays an important role in the determination of length of therapy. Hepatitis D virus is an incomplete or defective virus which requires HBsAg as a cofactor. Both coinfection and secondary delta infection exist with secondary infection being the most serious. Hepatitis E virus is an RNA virus. Transmission is by the fecal-oral route although maternal-fetal transmission has recently been described. Prognosis is usually favorable with rare cases of fulminant HEV reported.

They cause acute respiratory tract infections that usually occur in epidemics. Isolated strains of influenza virus are named after the virus type (influenza A, B, or C) as well as the host and location of initial isolation, the year of isolation, and the antigenic designation of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are glycoproteins under separate genetic control, and because of this they can and do vary independently. The changes in these antigens are responsible for the antigenic drift characteristic of these viruses. The paramyxoviruses include several important human pathogens (mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus). Both paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses possess an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is a structural component of the virion and produces the initial RNA. Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are not related to the paramyxoviruses. They are 150-nm single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 2 antigen groups, A and B, which play no role in diagnosis and treatment. While the overall mortality is 0.5%, at-risk groups may be 25 to 35% mortality if untreated.

This report led first to the cessation of the vaccine's use and subsequently to its withdrawal from the market and the discontinuation of its production.# The withdrawal of the vaccine in the United States made its use impossible in developing countries, where the risk of any increase in intussusception would have been dramatically outweighed by the benefit of decreased rotavirus mortality rates. It is now apparent that the susceptibility to intussception is age related, with virtually no events in children <90 days of age.# Almost a decade later, a new rotavirus vaccine has been licensed in the United States and recommended for routine use beginning at <2 months of age. In the interim, some 4-5 million infants have died of rotavirus diarrhea in the developing world; most of these deaths could have been prevented by the original rhesus rotavirus vaccine. \"virus vaccine was taken off the market when a strong epidemiological link between application of the first (and second] dose of the vaccine and the development of gut intussuception' became apparent\" - Greenwood Microbiology 16th/526",

        "exp": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV) possesses a single-stranded linear RNA genome while hepatitis B virus (HBV) contains a double-stranded DNA genome. Detection of anti-HAV IgM in a single serum specimen obtained in the acute or convalescent stage is the quickest and most reliable method to diagnose hepatitis A infection. This antibody is usually present at onset of symptoms and may persist 3 to 6 months. Demonstration of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in serum is the most common method of diagnosing HBV infection. Other serologic markers helpful in characterizing infection with HBV include hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc), anti-hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that immune serum globulin (ISG) can prevent clinical hepatitis A even when given up to 10 days after exposure. Similar studies have shown that ISG was able to decrease the incidence of hepatitis B infection in exposed persons. Purified, noninfectious HBsAg derived from healthy HBsAg carriers has been used as a vaccine for active immunization for HBV infection. Hepatitis C is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae. The viral reservoir is human. Recent retrospective \"lookbacks\" suggest that many people were infected with HCV before testing of the blood supply was initiated in the early 1990s. HCV is treatable with combinations of drugs. The genotype of the virus plays an important role in the determination of length of therapy. Hepatitis D virus is an incomplete or defective virus which requires HBsAg as a cofactor. Both coinfection and secondary delta infection exist with secondary infection being the most serious. Hepatitis E virus is an RNA virus. Transmission is by the fecal-oral route although maternal-fetal transmission has recently been described. Prognosis is usually favorable with rare cases of fulminant HEV reported.

        "exp": "Ans. a (Pre C+C) (Ref. Robbin's pathology 7th/ 18-D; Ananthanarayan Microbiology, 7th/ 552)HBV is a partially double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus packaged with a core protein (HBcAg) and DNA polymerase, and enclosed by envelope proteins (HBsAg). Following receptor-mediated entry into hepatocytes, the virus enters the nucleus, where its DNA is frequently integrated into the host genome.The HBV has four genes: S, P, C, and X. The S gene codes for the \"major\" envelope protein (HBsAg). The largest is P gene. It codes for DNA polymerase. The C gene codes for HBeAg and HBcAg. The C gene has a precore and a core region. If translation is initiated at the precore region, the protein product is HBeAg. If translation begins with the core region, HBcAg is the protein product. HBeAg is a marker of HBV replication and infectivity. The precore region is not necessary for viral replication. Precore mutants can replicate. They are readily detectable by HBV DNA in serum, but hepatitis B e antigen (HbeAg) is absent. The X gene codes for HBxAg. The product of the X gene is hepatitis B x antigen (HBxAg). It may be involved in carcinogenesis. Basal core promoter mutants cause a reduction in HBeAg production.Protein synthesis proceeds from 4 open reading frames:# Envelope proteins - Major, Middle, and Large - (HBsAg) from the -S gene, pre-Sl, and pre-S2 gene sequences;# The e antigen (HBeAg) and core protein (HBcAg) from the -C gene and pre-C gene sequence;# DNA polymerase protein from the -P gene; and# Transactivator X-protein from the -X gene.",

        "exp": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus that causes a number of syndromes; the most common is infectious mononucleosis. It is a ubiquitous enveloped DNA virus. Only one serotype of EBV has been recognized, although molecular methods have reorganized a number of genotypes of EBV.Infectious mononucleosis is an acute disease most commonly seen in younger people. It is characterized by a proliferation of lymphocytes, lymph node enlargement, pharyngitis, fatigue, and fever. Infection in young children is usually either asymptomatic or characteristic of an acute upper respiratory infection. Diagnosis is usually made by a positive heterophil test. Heterophil antibodies are those that occur in one species (human) and react with antigens of a different species. The heterophil test may be insensitive (30 to 60%) in children. Definitive diagnosis is made by detection of antibodies to EBV components.EBV causes a variety of other syndromes including Burkitt's lymphoma, the most common childhood cancer in Africa, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, commonly seen in China.Similar mononucleosis-like diseases are caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite. CMV causes fewer than 10% of infectious mononucleosis-like diseases. CMV \"mono\" is primarily characterized by fatigue. Congenital infection with CMV almost always causes serious sequelae, such as retardation and hearing loss. T. gondii also causes a variety of clinical problems, among them encephalitis in AIDS patients and food poisoning from the ingestion of raw meat. Although CMV and T. gondii are relatively rare causes of infectious mononucleosis, they must be ruled out, particularly when EBV tests are nonreactive.",

        "exp": "HPVs cause non-genital cutaneous and anogenital or mucosal syndromes. Mucosal and anogenital syndromes include cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer; conjunctival, oral, and laryngeal papillomas, and anogenital warts or condyloma accuminatum. HPV types 16, 18, 31, and 45 are high-risk strains associated with CIN and cancer, although additional types have also been found in such lesions. HPV types 6 and 11 cause the majority of papillomas and condyloma accuminatum. HPV infect the basal keratinocytes of the epithelial layer of skin and mucous membranes. Expression of viral proteins E5, E6, and E7 stimulates cell growth and results in thickening of the layers. As the cells mature, genome replication takes place and mature virions are released at the epithelial surface. The oncogenic mechanism of HPV involves integration of the viral genome (a) into the host chromosome. This results in inactivation of genes required for viral replication (d), which does not occur in these cells, and overexpression of HPV E6 and E7 proteins, which bind p53 and p105RB cellular growth suppressor proteins, a production of a clone of replicating cells with possible progression to neoplasia. Loss of HPV E6 and E7 (b) would forestall oncogenic changes; mutation of the virus (c) is not part of the process.",

        "exp": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus that causes a number of syndromes; the most common is infectious mononucleosis. It is a ubiquitous enveloped DNA virus. Only one serotype of EBV has been recognized, although molecular methods have reorganized a number of genotypes of EBV.Infectious mononucleosis is an acute disease most commonly seen in younger people. It is characterized by a proliferation of lymphocytes, lymph node enlargement, pharyngitis, fatigue, and fever. Infection in young children is usually either asymptomatic or characteristic of an acute upper respiratory infection. Diagnosis is usually made by a positive heterophil test. Heterophil antibodies are those that occur in one species (human) and react with antigens of a different species. The heterophil test may be insensitive (30 to 60%) in children. Definitive diagnosis is made by detection of antibodies to EBV components.EBV causes a variety of other syndromes including Burkitt's lymphoma, the most common childhood cancer in Africa, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, commonly seen in China.Similar mononucleosis-like diseases are caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite. CMV causes fewer than 10% of infectious mononucleosis-like diseases. CMV \"mono\" is primarily characterized by fatigue. Congenital infection with CMV almost always causes serious sequelae, such as retardation and hearing loss. T. gondii also causes a variety of clinical problems, among them encephalitis in AIDS patients and food poisoning from the ingestion of raw meat. Although CMV and T. gondii are relatively rare causes of infectious mononucleosis, they must be ruled out, particularly when EBV tests are nonreactive.",

        "exp": "Amplification assays (-PCR, DNA PCR, and b DNA tests) are routinely used to detect viral RNA in clinical specimens. The tests can be quantitative when reference standards are used, and appropriate positive and negative controls must be included in each test. Because these molecular based tests are very sensitive, they form the basis for plasma viral load determinations. It is generally agreed that the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) is of significant prognostic value. There are continual rounds of viral replication and cell killing in each patient, and the steady-state level of virus in the blood varies with individuals. A single measurement of plasma viral load approximately 6 months after infection can predict the risk of development of AIDS in men several years later. In women, viral load appears to be less predictive. The plasma viral load appears to be the best predictor of long-term clinical outcome, whereas CD4 lymphocyte counts are the best predictor of sho-term risk of developing an oppounistic disease. Plasma viral load measurements are a critical element in assessing the effectiveness of antiretroviral drug therapy. Ref:- Baveja textbook of Microbiology",
