        "question": "Which is true about measurement of BP with sphygmomanometer versus intra-aerial pressure measurements?",
        "exp": "The reason for this is - \"dissipation of pressure\". When BP is measured by sphygmomanometry, the principle is 'balancing of pressure between the cuff and the brachial aery'. Suppose the pressure in the aery is, say, 100 mm Hg. When the pressure just outside the aery is 100 mm Hg, the aery will be occluded completely, or when the pressure outside the aery becomes just less than 100, the aery will open up and the flow will sta in the aery. However, for pressure just outside the aery to be 100, pressure in the cuff has to be about 106 mm Hg; about 6 mm Hg is dissipated in the intervening tissue (muscle, fat) between the cuff and the aery. Thus, if we are looking for a point at which the aery is just occluded (with aerial pressure being 100), the cuff pressure at which it happens is about 106 mm Hg Hence, by sphygmomanometry, the pressure measured is higher as compared to direct intravascular pressure measurement.",

However, increased BP and hea rate seen after their occlusion is NOT a result of VMC ischemia or CNS ischemic response. This may be concluded from two observations: If the carotid sinus nerves (IX N.) have been previously cut, abolishing the discharge of baroreceptors to VMC, rise in BP is not seen after carotid occlusion although there is cerebral ischemia. If the carotids are clamped beyond the carotid sinus baroreceptors, it produces cerebral ischemia but no rise in BP. Sectioning the carotid sinus nerves will produce the same effect as that of carotid clamping. decreased discharge to the VMC and a resultant increase in BP and hea rate.
