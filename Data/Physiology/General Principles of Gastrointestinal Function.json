It lies entirely in the wall of the gut, begining in the esophagus and extending all the way to the anus. The enteric nervous system is composed mainly of two plexus: -Myenteric plexus or Auerbach's plexus : - It is an outer plexus lying between the longitudinal and circular muscle layer. The myenteric plexus controls mainly gastrointestinal motility' therefore, perisalsis requires an active myenteric plexus.Meissner's plexus or submucosal plexus : - It is an inner plexus that lies in the submucosa. The submucosal plexus controls mainly gastrointestinal secretion and local blood flow.",

The constant release of NO from endothelial cells produces vasodilatation, and basal release of NO produced by endothelialcells is a primary determinant of resting vascular tone. In GIT, NO produces relaxation of GI smooth muscles. Vasodilatation in corpora covernosa helps in penile erection,ii) NO acts as short lived biological messenger by stimulating a guanyl cyclase that produce cGMP and cGMP activates protein kinase Giii) NO inhibits platelets adhesion, activation and aggregation.iv) NO acts as gaseous neurotransmitter in brain and peripheral autonomic system. NO acts as a mediator of long term potentiation, cytotoxicity resulting from NMDA and nonadrenergic noncholinergic neurotransmission.v) In the immune system, NO serves as an effector of macrophage induced cytotoxicity, and overproduction of NO is a mediator of inflammation - Inhibitors of iNOS have a protective effect on arthritis, psoriasis & IBD.vi) NO decreases LDL oxidation and inhibits superoxide anion (O-2) production by inhibiting NADPH reductase activity. These actions result in a strong antiatherosclerotic effect.vii) Recent studies have provided important information on the use of inhaled nitric oxide for the management of several diseases characterized by the presence of abnormal pulmonary' vascular tone, such as persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.",
