        "exp": "Type II pneumocytes are epithelial cells present in the alveolar surface, their cytoplasm exhibits lamellar bodies.They have many functions the most impoant is production of surfactant.Surfactant are produced by exocytosis and not endocytosis. Pneumocytes: Alveolar surface is formed by two types of epithelial cells, pneumocytes I and pneumocytes II.Type II pneumocytes are specialised cells within the alveoli of the lungs. There are as many type II as type I pneumocytes within the alveoli, but type II cells only constitute 1-5% of the alveolar surface area as they are cuboidal rather than squamous in shape. Type I pneumocytes are simple squamous epithelial cells responsible for gas exchange in the alveoli and cover a majority of the alveolar surface area. They are connected to each other by tight junctions. Type II pneumocytes are specialised cells within the alveoli of the lungs, they are adapted to produce surfactant. Their cytoplasm exhibits apical secretory granules termed lamellar bodies. These are released continuously by exocytosis onto the epithelial cell surface. The lamellar bodies contain the phospholipid component of surfactant. They occupy the thick poion of the alveolar-capillary complex. Functions: The main function of type II cells is secretion of the lung surfactant. They paicipate in clearance and in repair by proliferating and migrating to damage areas. Type II cells are able to divide and to differentiate into type I cells. They paicipate in defense responses by expressing various receptors (in paicular, Toll-like receptors). Type II cells are involved in the lung cytokine/chemokine network by secreting and responding to an array of cytokines and chemokines. They regulate transmigration of monocytes across epithelial layer and possibly paicipate in T cell activation. Ref: Color Atlas & Text of Pulmonary Pathology, edited by Philip T.

This is the valve that must be blocked, because you can assume that blood is backing up into the area where the pressure is high. In this case, pressure is high in the right ventricle. So, there must be stenosis of the pulmonic valve, which allows blood to leave the right ventricle and travel to the lung. Also Know: If there was stenosis of the aoic valve, pressure would be high in the left ventricle. If there was stenosis of the tricuspid valve, pressure would be high in the right atrium. If there was stenosis of the mitral valve, pressure would be high in the left atrium. If you understand the path of blood flow in the hea, you can understand all these scenarios!

This seals off the damaged region and prevents fuher blood loss.The initial event is constriction of the vesselPhysiological response to hemorrhageIt is a three-pa process. The principal features are:- Rapidly responding neural and humoral mechanisms direct available blood flow toward vital organs.- More slowly evolving salt and water retention by the kidneys replaces the lost plasma.- Erythropoiesis gradually replaces the lost red blood cells.Acute response to hemorrhageThe acute response includes a primary decrease in cardiac output, a secondary decrease in aerial pressure and compensatory increases in hea rate and vascular resistance.Autonomic involvementIncreased hea rate and peripheral vasoconstriction signal the autonomic nervous system's paicipation in the acute response to hemorrhage.Autonomic dysfunction decreases the body's tolerance to blood loss.Selective vasoconstrictionSympathetic vasoconstriction during hemorrhage is selective.Many organs show intense vasoconstriction, while the cerebral and coronary circulations show little response to increased sympathetic outflow.The benefit of selectivity is that available blood flow, as meager as it may be, is preferentially directed to the brain and hea -- the vital organs.Suppo from Renin-Angiotensin systemThe renin-angiotensin system suppos aerial pressure in hemorrhage by constricting nonvital organs.This response is slower than the response of the sympathetic nervous system, but it is still an impoant pa of the acute circulatory response to hemorrhage.Salt and water retentionAfter hemorrhage, with no intervention, salt and water retention over several days will increase blood volume to normal or above.Erythrocytes are replaced much more slowly.",

Hence any factor which affects either the stroke volume or the hea rate or both affects the cardiac output. A) Factors affecting stroke volume Stroke volume, which is the amount of blood pumped by the hea during one stroke, depends mainly on three factors : ? Preload (Degree of ventricular filling during diastole) : - Cardiac preload is represented by volume of venous blood that distends the ventricle, i.e., venous return determines the preload. An increase in preload, i.e., increase in venous return results in a higher end-diastolic volume (Preload). This results in stretching of myocardial fiber and this increase in length of myofibril increases the strength of cardiac contraction in accordance with the Frank-Starling law or Starling's law of the hea. According to Starling's law, greater the initial length of muscle fiber, greater is the force of contraction. The initial length of muscle fiber (length of fiber at the initiation of contraction/systole) refers to length of the fiber at the end of the diastole, i.e., end-diastolic fiber length. Thus, the factors which improve venous return increase the cardiac output by increasing end-diastolic ventricular volume and length, i.e., preload.

In smooth muscle, Ca2+ ions entering through opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or following release from the SR, bind to calmodulin. The Ca2+-calmodulin complex activates myosin light chain kinase, and phosphorylation of myosin light chain initiates smooth muscle contraction. This is in contrast to cardiac and skeletal muscle, where contraction is triggered by a conformational change induced by Ca2+ handling. In cardiac muscle, opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels results in Ca2+. In skeletal muscle, depolarization of the T tubule triggers release of Ca2+ from the SR. In contrast to cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle contractions can summate during repeated stimulation, resulting in an increase in force with incomplete relaxation between the stimuli (tetanic contraction).

However, lungs also directly affect Na+ balaneQ epithelial Na+ channels (E NaCs). Absorption of excess fluid from alveolar lumen and airways require active transepithelial transpo of Na+ by ENaCs (mainly of alveolar type 11 and possibly type I cells.)AR, cystic fibrosis disease is characterized by thick, tenacious and dehydrated airway secretions. In CF, mutations in CFTR (cystic fibrosis trans membrane conductance regulator), which is a regulated CI channel, causes decreased ability to secrete Cl and therefore enhance Na+ and water absorption out of airway.

This heat production due to the contractile activity of muscle (in shivering) and may be associated with heat production due to increased metabolism in other organs like liver \u2192 whenever there is the production of heat with shivering (whether the heat production is due to shivering or other metabolic response), it is called shivering thermogenesis. In simple words,\u00a0the production of heat (whatever the mechanism), which has to shiver with it is called shivering thermogenesis.\nOn the other hand, when there is the production of heat without any shivering, it is called\u00a0non-shivering thermogenesis.\nIn humans, a neonate can adjust to cold exposure without any shivering, i.e.\u00a0non-shivering thermogenesis.\u00a0Whereas human adults always respond to cold with shivering, and there may be activation of another thermogenic mechanism also \u2192\u00a0shivering\u00a0thermogenesis.\nNow, you must be thinking that if we will wear many woollens than we will not have to shiver to the cold exposure. Yes, you are right, but in that case, we are preventing heat loss (conserving heat) but are not producing heat (no thermogenesis).\nIf an adult man is suddenly exposed to cold, without wearing woollens or too many clothes, the response will always be shivering. On the other hand, neonate can generate heat without shivering.\nI think I was quite clear in my discussion and now you know what exact shivering thermogenesis and non-shivering thermogenesis mean.\nIn human adult, there is no non-shivering thermogenesis as there is no brown fat in the adult:-\n\n\"As far as adult man is concerned, there is no evidence that non-shivering thermogenesis occurs\".\u2014 Energy metabolism in animal and man\n\nWhenever, wherever and in whichever, non-shivering thermogenesis occurs it is due to\u00a0sympathetic stimulation (norepinephrine).\nIn adults of lower species, non-shivering thermogenesis occurs in the liver, skeletal muscle and brown fat due to catecholamines (norepinephrine).",

The valve opens more widely, when this pressure difference is higher, which in normal conditions never allows CSF pressure to rise more than few mm Hg higher than cerebral venous sinus pressure. - Absorption is propoional to pressure.

It increases the permeability of the collecting ducts of the kidney, so that water enters the hypeonic interstitium of the renal pyramids. The urine becomes concentrated, and its volume decreases. The overall effect is therefore retention of water in excess of solute; consequently, the effective osmotic pressure of the body fluids is decreased. In the absence of vasopressin, the urine is hypotonic to plasma, urine volume is increased, and there is a net water loss. Consequently, the osmolality of the body fluid rises.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Rostral ventrolateral medullaBaroreceptors are mechanoreceptors that are located in the adventia of carotid aery and aoa, at specialized locations called sinuses.1) Carotid sinus is a little bulge at the root of internal carotid aery, located just above the bifurcation of the common carotid aery. It is innervated by the sinus nerve, a branch of glossopharyngeal (IX cranial) nerve.2) Aoic arch (aoic sinus) also contains mechenoreceptors (stretch receptors) which are similar to carotid sinus receptors. However, their afferent nerve fibers travel in the aoic nerve, a branch of Vagus (X cranial) nerve.The sinus nerve (from carotid sinus) and aoic nerve/vagal fibers (from aoic sinus) are together called `Sinoaoic nerves'. They, together, are also refered to as 'Buffer nerves' because they are the afferents of cardiovascular reflexes that buffer abrupt changes in blood pressure.Baroreceptors are highly sensitive to any change in mean blood pressure. Sinoaoic nerves (buffer nerves) normally discharge rhythmically, synchronous with the pressure fluctuation during systole and diastole. They respond to BP changes between 70 mm Hg and 150 mm Hg. When BP rises, baroreceptors are stimulated and their afferents (through sinoaoic nerves) stimulate nucleus of tractus solitarus (NTS) which inturn inhibits the pressor area ofVMC, i.e., Rostral ventrolateral medula (RVLM). This results in decreased sympathetic outflow and therefore decreases in vasomotor tone and vasodilation. Vasodilation brings down the BP, thereby helping hemostasis. Activated NTS also stimulates nucleus ambiguous (cardioinhibitory center) of medulla, which increases parasympathetic (vagal) output, through vagus, that decreases hea rate. Reduction in hea rate reduces the cardiac output, which also reduces BP. Baroreceptor stimulation also weekly inhibits respiration.When BP falls, for instance while changing the posture from lying down to standing, reverse change takes place. When a person stands up, his blood is pooled in the veins of lower limbs by the effect of gravity. Central venous pressure and venous return decrease, which causes a fall in stroke volume. Hence the systolic BP falls. As a result, the discharge rate of baroreceptors decreases leading to a decrease in the inhibitory influence on the pressor area of VMC. Hence vasomotor tone increases, leading to vasoconstriction, and consequently an increase in BP. Simultaneously, the nucleus ambiguous of the vagus is also inhibited, increasing the hea rate and consequently stroke volume and eventually BR Thus fall in BP due to change ofposture is very brief (Transient).",

Acute right-sided hea failure leads to acute congestion of the liver, which does not acquire the typical nutmeg appearance as in chronic congestion. Alcohol toxicity leads to a number of hepatic alterations. Fatty change results from alteration in lipoprotein metabolism, leading to accumulation of fats as a large single droplet within the cytoplasm of hepatocytes (microvesicular steatosis).

Because the loop is impermeable to Na+ and Cl\" and because these ions are not pumped out by active transpo, Na+ and Cl\" remain inside the loop.As the fluid continues to travel down the descending limb of the loop, it becomes more and more concentrated, as water continues to diffuse out. Maximum concentration occurs at the bottom of the loop.The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is impermeable to water, but Na+ and Cl\" are pumped out into the surrounding fluids by active transpo.As fluid travels up the ascending limb, it becomes less and less concentrated because Na+ and Cl\" are pumped out. At the top of the ascending limb, the fluid is only slightly less concentrated than at the top of the descending limb. In other words, there is little change in the concentration of the fluid in the tubule as a result of traversing the loop of Henle.In the fluid surrounding the loop of Henle, however, a gradient of salt (Na+, Cl\") is established, increasing in concentration from the top to the bottom of the loop.Fluid at the top of the collecting duct has a concentration of salts about equal to that at the beginning of the loop of Henle (some water is reabsorbed in the DCT).As the fluid descends the collecting duct, the fluid is exposed to the surrounding salt gradient established by the loop of Henle.Two outcomes are possible:If water conservation is necessary, as in contraction of the extra cellular fluid volume, ADH stimulates the opening of water channels in the collecting duct, allowing H20 to diffuse out of the duct and into the surrounding fluids. The result is concentrated urine.If water conservation is not necessary, ADH is not secreted and the duct remains impermeable to H20. The result is dilute urine.",

As PO2 rises fuher, hemoglobin molecules combine with their second, third and fouh molecules, which are progressively easier to combine with.Hence saturation rises steeply between PO2 of 15 mm Hg and 40 mm Hg.When PO2 rises still fuher, oxygen finds most of the hemoglobin molecules carrying four molecules of oxygen each.Since no molecules of hemoglobin can carry more than four molecules of oxygen, there is not much scope for more O2 combining with hemoglobin.Hence the curve becomes almost flat again beyond the PO2 of 60 mm Hg.",

Where is the enzyme responsible for this change located?",
        "exp": "Chylomicrons are produced by enterocytes (intestinal epithelial cells), using gut luminal triglycerides for the source of the lipid. The chylomicrons are secreted into the gut lymphatic system, and from there drain eventually into the systemic venous system from the thoracic duct, and hence into the serum poion of the blood. They are initially large and have a very high triglyceride content. With time, lipoprotein lipase releases triglycerides from the chylomicron core by hydrolyzing them to more easily absorbed fatty acids. The enzyme is located on the external surface of the vascular endothelium of tissues with triglyceride needs such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle tissue, and lactating breast. The result of lipoprotein lipase activity is that the chylomicrons shrink in size. While adipose tissue can utilize chylomicrons, lipoprotein lipase is located on the endothelial cells rather than adipocytes. Adipocytes have an adipose tissue lipase, which is an intracellular enzyme that can cleave triglycerides to glycerol and fatty acids, allowing them to be released into the circulation when chylomicrons are low. Enterocytes have the ability to pick up mixed micelles from the gut lumen for repackaging in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum as chylomicrons. Hepatocytes pick up the chylomicron remnants after the lipoprotein lipase shrinks them. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 26.

This lobe, which is phylogenetically the oldest pa of the cerebellum, has vestibular connections and is concerned with equilibrium. The rest of the vermis and the adjacent medial poions of the hemispheres form the spinocerebellum, the region that receives proprioceptive input from the body as well as a copy of the \"motor plan\" from the motor coex. By comparing plan with performance, it smoothes and coordinates movements that are ongoing. The vermis projects to the brainstem area concerned with control of axial and proximal limb muscles, whereas the hemispheres project the brainstem areas concerned with control of distal limb muscles. The lateral poions of the cerebellar hemispheres are called the cerebrocerebellum, or neocerebellum.

        "exp": "Diabetes insipidus is characterized by the excretion of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine (polyuria) with a commensurate increase in fluid intake (polydipsia). The most common type is due to inadequate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (also called vasopressin) and is usually referred to as \"neurogenic\" diabetes insipidus. This condition rarely causes severe problems as long as the person has plenty of water to drink. Placing the patient on overnight water restriction caused severe dehydration and a greatly elevated plasma sodium concentration. The possibility of diabetes mellitus, which can also be associated with polyuria and polydipsia, is easily excluded by the lack of glucosuria. Addison's disease results from failure of the adrenal coices to produce adrenocoical hormones. The lack of aldosterone leads to decreases in sodium reabsorption allowing large amounts of sodium to be lost into the urine. Polyuria and polydipsia are not characteristic of Addison's disease.

        "exp": "Thyroxine Increases Metabolism of Cells.\nThyroxine indirectly affects protein metabolism by increasing metabolism of the cells. If insufficient carbohydrates and fats are available for energy, thyroxine causes rapid degradation of proteins and uses them for energy. Conversely, if adequate quantities of carbohydrates and fats are available and excess amino acids are also available in the extracellular fluid, thyroxine can actually increase the rate of protein synthe\u00adsis. In growing animals or human beings, deficiency of thyroxine causes growth to be greatly inhibited because of lack of protein synthesis. In essence, it is believed that thyroxine\u00a0 has little specific effect on protein metabolism but does have an important general effect by increasing the rates of both normal anabolic and normal catabolic protein reactions.\nThyroid hormones stimulate metabolic rate, calorigenesis, cardiac function, and normal mentation, and interact synergistically with catecholamines. Thyroid hormones also play critical roles in development, particularly of the nervous system, and growth.\nNote: Lack of adequate amount of thyroxine can result in stunted growth with a stuffed-belly, and short stature with mental retardation.\nReference: GUYTON AND HALL TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, THIRTEENTH EDITION(INTERNATIONAL EDITION ) page no 1014",

Whereas the combination of putamen and globus pallidus is often referred to as lentiform nucleus - Efferent fiber bundle of substantia nigra (pars compacta) transmit dopaminergic fibers to corpus striatum/ striatum (dopaminergic nigro striatal projection). - Subthalamic nucleus (a diencephalic grey matter pa of basal ganglia) is the only nucleus of basal ganglia that actually produce excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Subthalamic nucleus receives inhibitory (GABA - nergic) imput from globus pallidus external segment (GPe) and has excitatory (glutaminergic) projections to both GPe and GPi (globus pallidus internal segment). Subthalamic nucleus plays an impoant role in stimulation of indirect SNpc-GPi (substantia nigra - pars compacta - globus pallidus internal segment) pathway. - Although the majority of striatal neurons are GABA nergic medium spiny neurons, the highest density of glutamate receptors in basal ganglia is found in corpus striatum (putamen + caudate nucleus)Q, which receives 2 main inputs (both of which are excitatory glutaminergic) from cerebral coex (coico striatal pathway) and from intralaminar nuclei of thalamus (thalamostriatal pathway).

Erythropoietin increases the number of erythropoietin sensitive committed stem cells in the bone marrow that are conveed to red blood cells precursors and subsequently to mature erythrocytes. In the absence of erythropoietin, erythroid stem cellsundergo apoptosis.In adults, about 85% of erythropoietin comes from the kidney (interstitial cells in peritubular capillary bed) and 15% from liver (Perivenous hepatocytes). Small amount is also produced in brain; and uterus and oviducts. Ceain tumors also produce erythropoietin, .e.g., Renal cell carcinoma, Hepatoma and cerebellar hemangioblastoma.The most impoant stimulus for erythropoietin secretion is hypoxia. Other stimulus that can increase its secretion are cobalt salts, androgens, alkalosis due to high altitude, and catecholamines f3-adrenergic mechanism.Pregnancy (due to placental lactogen), testosterone and prolactin increase the activity of erythropoietin. Estrogen inhibits utilization of erythropoietin by marrow cells and also impairs its production.

        "question": "True about Hyaline membrane disease:",
        "exp": "B i.e. FRC below the closing volume - Closing volume (CV) or critical CV is minimal volume of gas necessary to prevent small airway collapse. In young adults it is 10% of vital capacity (ie = 480 ML) and becomes equal to - 40% of VC (ie = FRC) at the age of 65 years. In RDS (hyaline membrane disease), the FRC decreases below closing volume (FRC < CV) indicating collapse of some alveolar segments during tidal breathing. - Volume of air in lung at the end of (1) force ful inspiration is TLC; (2) forceful expiration is residual volume (RV) and ; (3) normal tidal expiration is FRC. RV is 1200mL and FRC is 2200 mL. Therefore normally closing volume is more close to RV than to FRC. Closing Volume (CV) and Closing Capacity (CC) CV is volume below which the terminal airway connected to alveoli gets closed and hence the gas cannot come in or out of alveoli. In young subjects, the closing volume is about 10% of vital capacity (V C). It increases with age and becomes equal to about 40% of VC (i.e. = FRC) at the age of 65 years. Relatively small amounts early disease in the small airways apparently increases the closing volume. Single Breath N2 Washout Test to measure CV From mid inspiration, the subject takes a deep breath (vital capacity single breath) of pure (100%) 02 and then exhales steadily. The changes in N2 concentration of expired air (at lips) is continuously measured during subsequent full exhalation. 4 phases of N2 conc. can be recognized one after another. Phase I or initial gas exhaled is the gas that filled the pure dead space. It contains no N2 because inhaled gas is 100% 02. Phase II: Mixture of dead space & alveolar gas is exhaled (with increasing N2 conc). The volume of dead space is volume of gas expired from peak inspiration to mid poion of phase II. 3. Phase III: Pure alveolar gas is exhaled (with constant N2 conc). Phase III terminates at (ie transition from phase III to IV) is closing volume (CV). The CV is the lung volume above RV (residual volume) at which the airways in lower dependent pas of lungs begin to close off because of the lesser transmural pressure in these areas. In most normal persons phase III also has a slight positive slope indicating a gradual increase in the propoion of expired gas coming from relatively N2 rich upper poions of lung. Phase IV: At the end of expiration, an abrupt increase in N2 conc. is seen signaling closure of airways at the base of lung. This is caused by preferential emptying of apex, which has relatively high concentration of Nz. The gas in upper lung is richer in N2 than lower dependent poions because the upper lung alveoli are more distended at the sta of inspiration and therefore the N2 in them is less diluted with 100% 02 inspired from mid inspiration (because during a VC breath of 100% 02, apex expands less and therefore previously occupied N2 there is less diluted with 02). Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) or Relaxation Volume It is volume of air remaining in lungs after normal (tidal) exhalation. and is determined by the balance b/w the elastic recoil pressure generated by lung parenchyma to become smaller (inward recoil) and the pressure generated by chest wall to become larger (outward recoil). At FRC, transmural pressure across respiratory system (chest wall + lung) is zero (0). It is positive at greater & negative at smaller volumes. - FRC decreases when the chest wall muscles are weak, (eg paralysis) or the elastic recoil of lung (i.e. tendency of alveoli to collapse) is more eg hyaline membrane diseaseQ (i.e. lung elastic recoil > chest wall muscle force). Disease characterized by low FRC include pulmonary edema, pneumonitis & RDS/HMD. In hyaline membrane disease, FRC usually decreases below closing volumeQ. When closing capacity exceeds FRC (FRC < CC), some alveolar segments are collapsed during a poion of tidal breathing. This decreases V/P ratio and may cause hypoxia and hypercarbia. And when the CC > FRC + TV. (i.e. C C exceeds FRC plus tidal volume), lung segments will be collapsed during inspiration and expiration of tidal breathing. This fuher exaggerate V/P mismatch and lit complete atelectasis. So respiratory therapy is designated to increase the lung volume towards normal FRC. - Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) raise FRC to a level above CV/CC in diseases associated with alveolar collapse; So the terminal airways remain open throughout the respiratory cycle. In presence of airway obstruction, FRC increases b/o premature airway closure, which traps air in the lung.",

        "exp": "Motilin is a hormone released by the small intestine during the fasting state. Its waxing and waning blood levels correlate with the initiation and ending of migrating motor complexes (MMC). Fuhermore, injection of motilin has been shown to evoke MMC activity. The MMC typically begins in the stomach, and over a 90-120 minute period, migrates to the ileum, where it dies out. As one complex dies out in the ileum, another complex begins in the stomach provided the fasting state continues. Eating a meal interrupts the MMC activity. Cholecystokinin is released during the intestinal phase of the digestive period (not during a fast). Its secretion is evoked by the presence of fat and protein digestion products in the duodenum. It induces contraction of the gallbladder and relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi. Gastrin is released from G cells in the antrum, mostly during the gastric phase of the digestive period (not during a fast). It tends to increase stomach motility, although the rate of emptying is decreased because gastrin also causes the pyloric sphincter to contract. It also may contribute to the increase in ileal and colonic motility as pa of the gastroileal and gastrocolic reflexes, respectively. Gastrin-releasing peptide mediates the neural release of gastrin. Antral enteric neurons that are activated by vagal efferents or by local reflexes release gastrin-releasing peptide, which stimulates the G cells to secrete gastrin.",

They occur rhythmically on both sides of the head but are often slightly higher in amplitude on the nondominant side, especially in right-handed individuals. A normal alpha variant is noted when a harmonic of alpha frequency occurs in the posterior head regions. They tend to be present posteriorly more than anteriorly and are especially prominent with closed eyes and with relaxation. Alpha activity disappears normally with attention (e.g., mental arithmetic, stress, opening eyes). In most instances, it is regarded as a normal waveform. An abnormal exception is alpha coma, most often caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy of destructive processes in the pons (e.g., intracerebral hemorrhage). In alpha coma, alpha waves are distributed uniformly both anteriorly and posteriorly in patients who are unresponsive to stimuli. Beta waves are observed in all age groups. They tend to be small in amplitude and usually are symmetric and more evident anteriorly. Drugs, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, augment beta waves. Theta waves normally are seen in sleep at any age. In awake adults, these waves are abnormal if they occur in excess. Theta and delta waves are known collectively as slow waves. Delta waves are slow waves have a frequency of 3 Hz or less. They normally are seen in deep sleep in adults as well as in infants and children. Delta waves are abnormal in the awake adult. Often, they have the largest amplitude of all waves. Delta waves can be focal (local pathology) or diffuse (generalized dysfunction).",

In addition, the oblique or sling fibers of the stomach wall create a flap valve that helps close off the esophagogastric junction and prevent regurgitation when intragastric pressure rises.The tone of the LES is under neural control.Release of acetylcholine from vagal endings causes the intrinsic sphincter to contact, and release of NO and VIP from interneurons innervated by other vagal fibers causes it to relax.Contraction of the crural poion of the diaphragm, which is innervated by the phrenic nerves, is coordinated with respiration and contractions of chest and abdominal muscles.Thus, the intrinsic and extrinsic sphincters operate together to permit orderly flow of food into the stomach and to prevent reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus.",

Myocardial fibers (cells) have RMP of approximately -90mv. Action Potential in Cardiac Ventricular Muscles volts in ventricular muscle fibers instead of -55 milivolts in the nodal fibers. - Action potential in cardiac muscle fibers averages about 105 mili volts i.e. the intracellular potential rises form a very negative -90 mV between beats to slightly positive +20 mV during each beat. 3 type of membrane ion channels in cardiac muscles responsible for causing the voltage changes include Channel Effect Fast Na' Rapidly opening of fast sodium channels for Channel 10,000 the of a second) causes rapid influx of positive sodium ion (Na+) to the interior of cardiac muscle fiber (Necurrent, IN.). It is responsible for rapid upstroke spike of action potential or rapid depolarization phase 0. Initial rapid repolarization phase lis caused by inactivation of Na+ channels. Slow Ca++ Slower opening of slow calcium (or sodium? (Na+ - Ca++) calcium) channels for about 0.3 second (i.e Channels longer duration) causes large influx of both Ca*+ and Na+ positive ions to interior of cardiac muscle fibre. This (Ca++ current/influx, Ica mainly) is responsible for maintenance of prolonged period of depolarization or platue phase (2) of ventricular AP. Potassium Rapid diffusion of large amounts of positive K+ (K+) Channels ions in outward direction (efflux) from the cardiac muscle fibre (Ek+, K+ current) immediately returns the membrane potential to its resting levels, thus ending the AP Difference b/w AP of Cardiac of Skeletal Muscles Cardiac muscles have prolonged AP (Action potential) and a platue phase, whereas skeletal muscles do not because AP of skeletal muscle is caused and almost entirely by sudden opening of fast Na+ channels for a very sho period. At the end of this abrupt closure, repolarization occurs and AP is over in another thousandth of a second. Whereas AP in cardiac muscle is caused by same fast Na+ channels as well as slow Ca+ (Na+ - channels which are slower to open and more impoantly remain open for several tenths of a second (i.e prolonged duration) thereby maintaining prolonged period of depolarization, causing the platue phase. In skeletal muscles, Ca++ ions for contraction is derived from intracellular sacroplasmic reticulum. Whereas, in cardiac muscles the Ca** that enters during plate phase activate the muscle contractile process. Immediately after the onset of AP, the permeability of cardiac muscle fiber for K+ decreases about 5 folds as a result of excess Ca++ influx through Ca++ channels. Therefore, greatly decreased outflux of positively charged K+ ions during AP platue in cardiac muscles prevents early return of AP voltage to its resting levels. This greatly decreased K+ permeability is not seen in skeletal muscles. Difference b/w AP of Cardiac Muscle & Sinus Nodal Fibers - AT the less negative (- 55 mV) RMP of nodal fibers the fast Na* channels mainly have already become inactivated (or blocked). Therefore only the slow Na+ channels can become activated (open) and cause AP. - So AP is slower to develop in nodal fibers than ventricular fibers. Similarly return of potential to its negative resting state occurs slowly as well rather than the abrupt return that occurs in ventricular muscles.",

Because ABP binds to T and DHT, these hormones are made less lipophilic and become concentrated within the luminal fluid of the seminiferous tubules. The higher levels of these hormones enable spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules and sperm maturation in the epididymis. ABP's production is regulated under influence of FSH on Seoli cell, enhanced by insulin, retinol, and testosterone. ABP may also be secreted in other organs; for instance, mice produce a salivary ABP",

Loss of inhibitory control on lactotropes leads to hyperprolactinemia (galactorrhea).\nIf the pituitary stalk is cut above the pituitary gland but the entire hypothalamus is left intact, the posterior pituitary hormones continue to be secreted normally, after a transient decrease for a few days; they are then secreted by the cut ends of the fibers within the hypothalamus and not by the nerve endings in the posterior pituitary. The reason for this is that the hormones are initially synthesized in the cell bodies of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and are then transported in combination with \u201ccarrier\u201d proteins called neurophysins down to the nerve endings in the posterior pituitary gland, requiring several days to reach the gland.\nADH is formed primarily in the supraoptic nuclei, whereas oxytocin is formed primarily in the paraventricular nuclei. Each of these nuclei can synthesize about one sixth as much of the secondary hormone as of its primary hormone.\nWhen nerve impulses are transmitted downward along the fibers from the supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei, the hormone is immediately released from the secretory granules in the nerve endings by\u00a0 the usual secretory mechanism of exocytosis and is absorbed into adjacent capillaries. Both the neurophysin and the hormone are secreted together, but because they are only loosely bound to each other, the hormone separates almost immediately. The neurophysin has no known function after leaving the nerve terminals.\nReference: GUYTON AND HALL TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, THIRTEENTH EDITION(INTERNATIONAL EDITION ) page no 948,949",

The new or facilitated pathways are called memory traces. They are important because, once the traces are established they can be selectively activated by the thinking mind to reproduce the memories. Also, long-term memories result from changed synaptic conduction in lower brain centers.\nStereocilia, project upward from the hair cells and either touch or are embedded in the surface gel coating of the tectorial membrane, which lies above the stereocilia in the scala media. These hair cells are similar to the hair cells found in the macula and cristae ampullaris of the vestibular apparatus. Bending of the hairs in one direction depolarizes the hair cells, and bending in the opposite direction hyperpolarizes them. This in turn excites the auditory nerve fibers synapsing with their bases. When the basilar fibers bend toward the scala vestibuli, the hair cells depolarize, and in the opposite direction they hyperpolarize, thereby generating an alternating hair cell receptor potential that, in turn, stimulates the cochlear nerve endings that synapse with the bases of the hair cells. It is believed that a rapidly acting neurotransmitter is released by the hair cells at these synapses during depolarization. It is possible that the transmitter substance is glutamate, but this is not certain.\nReference: GUYTON AND HALL TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, THIRTEENTH EDITION(INTERNATIONAL EDITION ) page no 746,748,676,677",

They differ from and have no homology with the sodium-dependent glucose transpoers, SGLT 1 and SGLT 2, responsible for the secondary active transpo of glucose out of the intestine, although the SGLTs also have 12 transmembrane domains. Paicularly in transmembrane helical segments 3, 5, 7, and 11, the amino acids of the facilitative transpoers appear to surround channels that glucose can enter.

B: Law of projection No matter where a paicular sensory pathway is stimulated along its course to the coex, the conscious sensation produced is referred to the location of the receptor. This principle is called the law of projection. Coical stimulation experiments during neurosurgical procedures on conscious patients illustrate this phenomenon. For example, when the coical receiving area for impulses from the left hand is stimulated, the patient repos sensation in the left hand, not in the head. Another example is seen in amputees. Some of these patients may complain, often bitterly, of pain and proprioceptive sensations in the absent limb (phantom limb). The ends of the nerves cut at the time of amputation often form nerve tangles called neuromas. These may discharge spontaneously or when pressure is put on them. The impulses generated in them are in nerve fibers that previously came from sense organs in the amputated limb, and the sensations evoked are projected to where the receptors used to be.",

Chest wall has a tendency to move outward which is balanced by inward recoil of alveoli 3. In expiratory pleural pressure is equal to alveolar pressure 4. Muscle that elevates the chest cage are classified as muscle of expiration",
        "exp": "\" At the end quite of expiration, the tendency of the lung to recoil from the chest wall is just balanced by the tendency of the chest wall to recoil in the opposite direction\" LUNG: INSPIRATION AND EXPIRATION. The expiratory reserve volume is the maximum extra volume of air that can be expired by forceful expiration after the end of a normal tidal expiration; this normally amounts to about 1100 mls. The compliance of the combined lung-thorax system is almost exactly one half that of the lung alone -110 milliliters of volume per centimeter of water pressure for the combined system, compared with 200 ml/cm for the lungs alone. Fuhermore, when the lungs are expanded to high volumes or compressed to low volumes, the limitation of the chest become extreme, when near these limits, the compliance of the combined lung-thorax system can be less than one fifth that of the lungs alone. All the muscles that elevate the chest cage are classified as muscles of inspiration, and those muscles that depress the chest cage are classified as muscles expiration. Note: The most impoant muscles that raise the rib cage are the external intercostals, but other that help are the (1) sternocleidomastoid muscles, which lift upward on the sternum: (2) anterior serrati, which lift many of the ribs ; and (3) scaleni, which lift the first two ribs The muscles that pull the rib cage downward during expiration are mainly the (1) abdominal recti (2) internal intercostals. The normal pleural pressure at the beginning of inspiration is about -5 centimeters of water, which is the amount of suction required to hold the lungs open to their resting level. Then, during normal inspiration, expansion of the chest cage pulls, outward on the lungs with greater force and creates more negative pressure to an averages of about -7.5 centimeters of water. To cause inward flow of air into the alveoli during inspiration, the pressure in the alveoli must fall to a value slightly below atmospheric pressure(below 0). During normal inspiration, alveolar pressure decreases to about -1 centimeter of water. This slight negative pressure is enough to pull 0.5 liter of air into the lungs in the 2 seconds required for normal quiet inspiration. During expiration, opposite pressure occur. The alveolar pressure rise to about +1 centimeter of water, and this force the 0.5 liter of inspired air out of the lungs during the 2 to 3 seconds of expiration. Transpulmonary Pressure : the difference between the alveolar pressure and the pleural pressure. This is called the transpulmonary pressure. It is the presssure difference between that in the alveoli and that on the outer surface of the lungs, and it is a measure of the elastic force in the lungs that tend to collapse the lungs at each instant of respiration, called the recoil pressure.

This finding suppos which of the following features of neoplasia?",
        "exp": "G6PD is an enzyme involved in carbohydrate metabolism-it is neither an oncogene nor a tumor suppressor, and its altered expression in tumor cells is solely due to its location on the X chromosome. Each somatic cell expresses only one X chromosome, and thus only one of the two isotypes of G6PD. The presence of only one form of G6PD in the tumor cells reflects the monoclonal origin of the cells. Cells contained in the neoplasm express only a single isotype of G6PD because they are all derived from a single progenitor cell. Genetic mutation does not underlie the monotypic expression of G6PD in the tumor cells. The allele for G6PD not expressed in the monoclonal cell line was inactivated in embryogenesis (in the Barr body). Although genetic mutation is a requirement of neoplasia, it is not demonstrated by this phenomenon. Mosaicism is the expression of two or more different phenotypes heterogeneously throughout an organ or organism. Mosaicism usually reflects an asymmetry of mitotic division in embryogenesis. G6PD is not an oncogene, it is a metabolic enzyme expressed constitutively in all cells. Altered expression of G6PD does not produce any growth advantage in a cell. Ref: Van Solinge W.W., van Wijk R.

This may be at least paly due to increase in the activity of membrane Nall(' ATPase. Thyroid hormones also increase the number and activity of mitochondria, which may be the cause or the effect of increase in oxygen consumption. By increasing the BMR, thyroid hormones raise body temperature, loss of body weight and increase urinary nitrogen loss.ii) Growth and development :- Thyroid hormones are essential for normal growth and development.iii) Carbohydrate metabolism :- Thyroid hormones have both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic effects. The hypoglycemic effect is the increased glycolysis. The hyperglycemic effects are stimulation of glycogenolysis and glucoconeogenesis. The net effect is hyperglycemia and depletion of glycogen.iv) Fat metabolism :- Thyroid hormone stimulates both lipogenesis and lipolysis. The lipolysis exceeds lipogenesis. Thus thyroid hormones moblize fat from adipose tissue, leading to an increase in plasma concentration of FFAs.v) Protein metabolism : - Thyroid hormone has a protein anabolic effect but in large doses, it has a protein catabolic effect. Thus thyroid hormone increases both protein synthesis and protein degradation.vi) Cardiovascular effects :- The thyroid hormones increase the hea rate, cardiac contractility, stroke volume and cardiac output, and consequently also the systolic BP. But the diastolic BP may fall due to vasodilatation in several vascular beds with decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. The cardiovascular effects of thyroid hormones are paly mediated by potentiation of effects of catecholamines.vii) GIT :- Thyroid hormones increase GI secretion, absorption and motility.viii) Nervous system :- Thyroid hormones are essential for normal formation of synapses and myelination in the developing brain.ix) Respiratory system :- Thyroid hormones increase the rate and depth of respiration.About option a & dIn low concentration thyroid hormone increases protein synthesis, but in high concentration (as in hypehyroidism) it is catabolic.Hypehyroidism causes decrease in cholesterol due thyroxine induced increased LDL receptor synthesis in liver, and consequent increase in the removal of LDL from circulation.",

Physical examination reveals a slightly enlarged, non-tender thyroid gland, and a normal cardiac exam. The serum thyroxine (T4) level is increased; however, the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal. Which of the following best explains the laboratory findings in this patient?",
        "exp": "The total serum thyroxine (T4) represents the sum of the T4 bound to thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) and the free T4. An increased total T4 may be due to an increase in TBG or an increase in free T4, the latter leading to signs of thyrotoxicosis. A decreased total T4 may be secondary to a reduction in TBG or in free T4, the latter leading to signs of hypothyroidism. In a euthyroid state, one-third of the binding sites on TBG are occupied by T4. An increase in estrogen (pregnancy, bih control pills) increases the synthesis of TBG. Since one-third of the binding sites on TBG will be occupied, the T4 bound to the additional TBG increases the total serum T4. The addition of extra TBG does not alter the free T4 level because of the equilibrium between the serum concentration of T4 and thyroid gland T4 production. Since the free T4 level is normal, there is no stimulus to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland. Regarding the patient's enlarged thyroid gland, heat intolerance, and palpitations, these are normal findings in pregnancy and do not indicate an overactive thyroid gland. Estrogen is increased (not decreased) in pregnancy. The serum free T4 is normal in pregnancy. This explains why the serum TSH is normal in the presence of an elevated serum T4, which reflects the increase in TBG normally occurring in pregnancy. The increase in progesterone during pregnancy has no effect on TBG levels.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Decreased PaCO2 Haemoglobin is the primary vehicle for transpoing oxygen in the blood. The oxygen carrying capacity is determined by the amount of haemoglobin present in the blood. Oxygen is also carried dissolved in the blood's plasma, but to a much lesser degree. A hemoglobin molecule can bind up to four oxygen molecules in a reversible way. The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve has a sigmoidal or S-shape. The paial pressure of oxygen in the blood at which the hemoglobin is 50% saturated, is known as the P50. The P50 is a conventional measure of hemoglobin affinity for oxygen. An increased P50 indicates a rightward shift and a decreased affinity of the standard curve, which means that a larger paial pressure is necessary to maintain a 50% oxygen saturation. Conversely, a lower P50 indicates a leftward shift and a higher affinity. Left shift of the curve is a sign of hemoglobin's increased affinity for oxygen (e.g. at the lungs). Similarly, right shift shows decreased affinity, as seen in: An increase in body temperature, An increase in hydrogen ion, An increase in 2, 3-bisphosphoglycerate An increase in carbon dioxide concentration (the Bohr effect) With fetal hemoglobin, the shift facilitates diffusion of oxygen across the placenta. The oxygen dissociation curve for myoglobin exists even fuher to the left.",

The lack of much effect on the resting membrane potential would be predicted, since the permeability of the membrane to Na+ at rest is relatively low.Conversely, increasing the external K+ concentration decreases the resting membrane potential.A decrease in extracellular Ca2+ concentration increases the excitability of nerve and muscle cells by decreasing the amount of depolarization necessary to initiate the changes in the Na+ and K+ conductance that produce the action potential.

This condition is characterized especially by failure of body growth and by mental retardation. It results from congenital lack of a thyroid gland (congenital cretinism), from failure of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone because of a genetic defect of the gland, or from a lack of iodine in the diet (endemic cretinism).\nA neonate without a thyroid gland may have a normal appearance and function because it was supplied with some (but usually not enough) thyroid hormone by the mother while in utero. A few weeks after birth, however, the\u00a0 neonate\u2019s movements become sluggish and both physical and mental growth begin to be greatly retarded. Treatment of the neonate with cretinism at any time with adequate iodine or thyroxine usually causes normal return of physical growth, but unless the cretinism is treated within a few weeks after birth, mental growth remains permanently retarded. This state results from retardation of the growth, branching, and myelination of the neuronal cells of the central nervous system at this critical time in the normal development of the mental powers.\nSkeletal growth in a child with cretinism is characteristically more inhibited than is soft tissue growth. As a result of this disproportionate rate of growth, the soft tissues are likely to enlarge excessively, giving the child with cretinism an obese, stocky, and short appearance. Occasionally the tongue becomes so large in relation to the skeletal growth that it\u00a0 obstructs swallowing and breathing, inducing a characteristic guttural breathing that sometimes chokes the child.\nReference: GUYTON AND HALL TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, THIRTEENTH EDITION(INTERNATIONAL EDITION ) page no 963",

Clathrin molecules have the shape of triskelions, with three \"legs\" radiating from a central hub. As endocytosis progresses, the clathrin molecules form a geometric array that surrounds the endocytotic vesicle. At the neck of the vesicle, the GTP binding protein dynamin is involved, either directly or indirectly, in pinching off the vesicle. Once the complete vesicle is formed, the clathrin falls off and the three-legged proteins recycle to form another vesicle. The vesicle fuses with and dumps its contents into an early endosome. From the early endosome, a new vesicle can bud off and return to the cell membrane. Alternatively, the early endosome can become a late endosome and fuse with a lysosome in which the contents are digested by the lysosomal proteases. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is responsible for the internalization of many receptors and the ligands bound to them--including, for example, nerve growth factor (NGF) and low-density lipoproteins. It also plays a major role in synaptic function. Also Know: In exocytosis the cytoplasmic sides of two membranes fuse, whereas in endocytosis two non cytoplasmic sides fuse.

Examples are syndecan, betaglycan, serglycan, perlecan, aggrecan, versican, decorin, biglycan & firomodulin.The protein of PG that bound covalently to glycosaminoglycans are called core proteins.

Hence, the blood contains more amount of conjugated bilirubin.\nWhen total obstruction of bile flow occurs, no bilirubin can reach the intestines to be converted into urobilinogen by bacteria. Therefore, no urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the blood, and none can be excreted by the kidneys into the urine. \nConsequently, in total obstructive jaundice, tests for urobilinogen in the urine are completely negative. Also, stools become clay colored owing to a lack of stercobilin and other bile pigments.",

        "question": "In the cardiac intervention theatre, during the passage of an intravenous catheter, numerous endothelial cells are dislodged from the lining of the popliteal vein. What substance allows platelet adhesion to the exposed collagen fibers?",
        "exp": "Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a self-polymerizing clotting protein present in the serum and the subendothelial basal lamina, which has binding sites for collagen, platelets, and fibrin. At a site of injury, vWF forms the bridge between the exposed collagen fibers and platelets in circulation, stimulating platelet degranulation and initiating the cellular component of the clotting cascade. An equally impoant role for vWF is binding platelets to the newly formed fibrin strands in a blood clot. Factor VIII and Factor IX are clotting proteins of the intrinsic pathway. Factor VIII acts in conce with activated Factor IX (IXa) to cleave Factor X to Xa. Xa is the prothrombin activator central to both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Fibronectin is a serum protein that acts as an opsonin for phagocytic cells in clots. Fibronectin binds non-specifically to bacteria and other materials in the newly forming clots, and draws the cell membrane of phagocytes into contact with these substances. Tissue factor is a protein released from injured tissues that works in conce with Factor VII to initiate the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. Like Factors VIII and IX, tissue factor and Factor VII cleave Factor X to Xa.",
