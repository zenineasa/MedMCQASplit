It is synthesized in the liver within a few seconds to minutes after formation of angiotensin I, two additional amino acid are split from the angiotensin I to from the 8-amino acid peptide angiotensin II. This conversation occurs almost entirely in the lungs while the blood flows through the small vessels of lungs, catalyzed by an enzyme called angiotensin conveing enzyme (ACE) that is present in the endothelium of the lungs vessels. FUNCTION: Angiotensin II is an extremely powerful vasoconstrictor. Vasoconstrictor occurs intensely in the aerioles and much less so in the veins. It decrease excretion of both slowly salt and water by the kidneys. This slowly increases the extracellular fluid volume, which then increase the aerial pressure during subsequent hours and days. It exes impoant actions at vascular smooth muscle, adrenal coex, kidney, hea and brain. Act directly on the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal coex to stimulate aldosterone biosynthesis. At higher concentrations, angiotensin II also stimulates glucocoicoid biosynthesis. Angiotensin II act on the kidney to cause renal vasoconstriction, contraction of mesangial cells with a resultant decrease in GFR increase proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, and inhibit the secretion of renin. In addition to its central effects on blood pressure, angiotensin II acts on the central nervous system to stimulate drinking (dipsogenic effect ) and increase the secretion of vasopressin and adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH).

Because of the decrease in gastric acid secretion, luminal bacteria would most likely exhibit increased (not decreased) growth. One of the functions of HCl secreted by the parietal cells is to sterilize the gastric lumen. Patients with Type A gastritis have an increased likelihood of developing gastric carcinoma. A decrease in acid secretion leads to increased secretion of gastrin by antral G cells. This is because low gastric pH (less than 3) inhibits gastrin secretion paracrine release of somatostatin from cells in the gastric mucosa that can sense the acidity.

When air is breathed at high pressure (e.g., during a deep sea dive), increased amounts of gas (paicularly nitrogen) become dissolved in the blood and tissues. If the diver then ascends (depressurizes) too rapidly, the nitrogen expands in the tissues and bubbles out of solution in the blood to form gas emboli. Since bubbles can form in or migrate to any pa of the body, it can produce many symptoms, and its effects may vary from joint pain, ischemia in tissues to paralysis and death. The rapid formation of gas bubbles within skeletal muscles and suppoing tissues in and about joints is responsible for the painful condition called the bends. In the lungs, edema, hemorrhages, and focal atelectasis or emphysema may appear, leading to respiratory distress, the so-called chokes. Treatment of gas embolism requires placing the individual in a compression chamber where the barometric pressure may be raised, thus forcing the gas bubbles back into solution. Subsequent slow decompression theoretically permits gradual resorption and exhalation of the gases so that obstructive bubbles do not re-form.",

        "exp": "B i.e. Decreased proliferation of epithelial cellsGut (colonic) microflora synthesize sho chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by fermenting complex carbohydrate, resistant starches and other components of dietary fibers & mucin that escape digestion in upper git. They also produce vitamin K and biotin, detoxify xenobiotics, increase & maturate immunity, , preventing allergy and growth of pathogenic bacteria. They promote development of normal colonic epithelium and stimulate intestinal epithelial cell differentiation (ie increase not decrease proliferation of epithelial cells)Role of Colonic Microflora (Enteric Bacterial Ecosystem)Large intestine contains a unique biological ecosystem consisting of trillions of commensal (non pathogenic) bacteria that engage in a life long symbiotic relationship with their human host. This colonic ecosystem is established sholy after bih and remains remarkably stable unless disturbed by antibiotics. It is highly unusual relationship as other body compaments are largely sterile. It is involved inFermentation & Digestion of Complex Carbohydrate - Colonic bacteria metabolize meal components that are not digested by host enzymes and make their products available to the body fermentation. It provides advantage to the host in that the colonic bacteria are capable of performing metabolic reactions that do not take place in mammalian cells.- Carbohydrates that humans cannot digest without bacterial help include complex carbohydrate, resistant starches, dietary fibers, mucin (moucous) produced by gut and oligosaccharides / sugars that the body failed to digest /absorb d/t some pathology eg lactose in lactose intoleranceFormation of Sho Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)- Colonic bacteria form SCFAs by femanting carbohydrates (starches, fibers). SCFAs are 2-5 carbon weak acids with 80mmol/L average normal concentration in lumen. About 60% of this is acetate, 25% propionate and 15% butyrate.- SCFAs are absorbed & metabolized to make a significant contribution to total calory intake - butyrate is a critical energy source for colonocytes.- SCFAs exce a trophic effect on colonic epithelium cells. The colonic epithelium turns over rapidly even in health,limiting the genetic damage that might otherwise be caused by exposure to toxins in lumen. However, this also increases the risk of malignancy. The colonic flora ( SCFAs) is involved in promoting development of normal colonic epithelium and in stimulating its differentiated functions. Butyrate regulates the expression of specific gene in colonic epithelial cells and may suppress the development of a malignant phenotype. Expression of SMCT1 (sodium monocarboxylate transpoers 1) eg SLC5A8 may be reduced in colon cancers, thereby reducing butyrate uptake - which may contribute to malignant transformation. So SCFAs increase the growth of intestinal epithelial cells and control their proliferation & differentiation (ie promoting normal development & stimulating differentiation)- SCFAs combat inflammation (prevent inflammatory bowel disease) maintain acid -base equilibrium (absorbed in pa by exchange for H+) and promote absorption of Na+, Mg++, Ca+ and Fe++Metabolism of Exogenous & Endogenous Substances- Gut flora forms secondary bile acids and deconjugate any bile acids that have escaped uptake in terminal ileum- Contribute to formation of intestinal gas.Detoxification- Detoxify xenobiotics (eg drugs) & dietary carcinogen (but may also generate toxic or carcinogenic compounds from dietary substrates.Antimicrobial- Gut flora limits the growth & invasion of pathogenic microorganisms by1) Functioning as a physical barrier to prevent attachment of pathogens.2) Forming microbicidal substances,3) Triggering gene expression in epithelium that counteracts the adverse effects of pathogensPrevent Allergy & Provide Immunity- Gut flora is not essential for life as animals raised in germ free conditions apparently develop normally. However, in these animals the mucosal immunity is immature and intestinal epithelial cells differentiate more slowlyQ- Colonic microflora trains immune system preventing allergy & providing immunity.Synthesis of Vitamin K & BiotinSubstrateEnzymesProductsDispositionEndogenous SubstratesUreaUreaseAmmoniaPassive absoionor excretion asammoniumBilirubinReductasesUrobilinogenStercobilinsPassivereabsorptionExcretedPrimary bileDehydroxylasSecondaryPassiveacidsesbile acidsreabsorptionConjugated bileDeconjugasesUnconjugatePassiveacids (primaryor secondary) d bile acidsreabsorptionExogenous SubstrateFiberGlycosidasesSho-chainfatty acidsHydrogen,CO2 andmethaneActive absorptionExcreted in breathor flatusAmino acidsDecarboxylasAmmoniaReabsorbed or es andandexcreted deaminasesbicarbonate(ammonia) asammoniumCysteine,methionineSulfatasesHydrogensulfideExcreted in flatu",

As a person grows older, the percentage of total body weight that is fluid gradually decreases. This decrease is due in part to the fact that aging is usually associated with an increased percentage of the body weight being fat, which decreases the percentage of water in the body.\nBecause women normally have a greater percentage of body fat compared with men, their total body water averages about 50 percent of the body weight. In premature and newborn babies, the total body water ranges from 70 to 75 percent of body weight. Therefore, when discussing \u201caverage\u201d body fluid compartments, we should realize that variations exist, depending on age, gender, and percentage of body fat.\nReference: GUYTON AND HALL TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, THIRTEENTH EDITION(INTERNATIONAL EDITION ) page no 306",

Closure of aoic valve Aoic pressure curve With the onset of rapid ejection phase of the ventricular systole, the aoic pressure rises steeply to reach a maximum of about 120 mm Hg. The ejection of blood into the aoa causes a stretch on the aoic walls and makes the blood in the entire aerial system to move at a faster rate. This sets up a pressure wave that travel along the aeries. The pressure wave expands the aerial wall as it travels, and expansion is palpable as the pulse. In the later pa of ventricular systole, the aoic pressure declines and continues to decline throughout the diastole, to reach a minimum of about 80 mm Hg during the isometric contraction of the next cardiac cycle. The elastic recoil of the aoa and the resistance of aerioles help to maintain relatively high aoic pressure during diastole. A notch (incisura or dicrotic notch) is rocorded in the early pa of down strok of the aoic pressure curve. It corresponds to the closure of aoic valve. It is produced by the sudden backward flow of aoic blood followed by the immediate cessation of backtlow due to closure of the aoic valves.",

By comparing plan with performance, it smoothes and coordinates movements that are ongoing. The vermis projects to the brainstem area concerned with control of axial and proximal limb muscles, whereas the hemispheres project the brainstem areas concerned with control of distal limb muscles.The lateral poions of the cerebellar hemispheres are called the cerebrocerebellum, or neocerebellum.

        "exp": "- Osmotic pressure of a solution is an indicator of the force of water movement resulting from its solute concentration. The higher the solute concentration of a solution, the greater its osmotic pressure. The plasma colloid osmotic pressure is often low in alcoholics with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). The diseased liver cannot produce adequate amounts of albumin, which leads to a decrease in the concentration of albumin in the plasma (i.e., hypoalbuminemia).\n- Because approximately 75% of the plasma colloid osmotic pressure can be attributed to the presence of albumin in the plasma, the decrease in plasma albumin concentration that occurs in the latter stages of cirrhosis often leads to peripheral edema. Cirrhosis also causes excess fluid to accumulate in the peritoneal cavity as ascites.\n- In the case of ascites, the edema results not only from hypoalbuminemia, but also from portal vein obstruction (which increases capillary hydrostatic pressure) and the obstruction of lymphatic drainage of the liver. In fact, ascites is observed more often than peripheral edema in liver disease.",

        "question": "GFR is determined by ?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., All of the above Determinants of GFR A) Increase glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure increases GFR. Glomerular hydrostatic pressure is determined by following variables : i) Aerial pressure, ii)Afferent aeriolar resistance; iii) Efferent aeriolar resistance. i) Increased aerial pressure tends to raise glomerular hydrostatic pressure and, therefore, to increase GFR. Opposite is true for decreased aerial pressure, i.e., Hypotension causes decrease in GFR. ii) Increased resistance of afferent aerioles (constriction of afferent aerioles) reduces glomerular hydrostatic pressure and decrease GFR. Conversely, dilation of the afferent aerioles increases both glomerular hydrostatic pressure and GFR. iii) Efferent aeriolar constriction has a biphasic effect on GFR. At moderate levels of constriction, there is a slight increase in GFR, but with severe constriction, there is a decrease in GFR. Dilatation of efferent aerile decreases glomerular hydrostatic pressure and therefore decreases GFR. B) Increased glomerular capillary colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure decreases GFR. Decreased glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure increases GFR, .e.g, in hypoproteinemia. Increased renal blood flow increases GFR by decreasing glomerular capillary oncotic pressure. Increased RBF causes decrease in filtration fraction (filtration fraction = GFR/RPF). This results in more fluid remaining in the glomerular capillary and dilution of plasma proteins and as a result decrease in oncotic pressure. Conversely, by opposite effect, Decreased renal blood flow decreases GFR. C) Increased Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure (due to increased tubular hydrostatic pressure as a result of obstruction) decreases GFR. D) Decrease in glomerular capillary filtration coefficient (K1) decreases GFR. K2 depends on the permeability of the glomerular membrane as well as its surface area. Increased thickness of membrane decreases the permeability and KrChronic hypeension and diabetes increases the thickness of glomerular membrane and decrease Kf and thereby GFR.Kfcan be altered by the mesangial cells which contract and cause decrease in Kr by decreasing surface area of membrane. Relaxation of mesangial cells increase K1. i) Contraction of mesangial cells (therefore decrease in GFR) is produced by : - Endothelin, angiotensin II, vasopressin, norepinephrine, PAF, PDGF, thromboxane A2,PGF2, Leukotrienes C4 & D4, Histamine. ii) Relaxation of mesangial cells (therefore increase in GFR) is produced by : - ANP, Dopamine, PGE2, cAMP .",

It is also called pyramidal tract because they form the pyramid of the medulla.The coicospinal tract originates about 30 percent from primary motor coex, 30 percent from premotor areas (premotor coex & supplementary motor area) and 40% from the somatosensory area. So, there are 40% sensory fibers in the coicospinal tract.After leaving the coex, it passes through the posterior limb of internal capsule and then downward through the brainstem, forming the pyramids of medulla. The majority (80%) of the pyramidal fibers then cross the lower medulla to the opposite side and descend as the lateral coicospinal tract and finally terminating principally on the interneuron in the intermediate region of gray matter. Some also terminate directly on the a-motor neuron, especially those concerned with skilled movement.A few fibers (20%) do not cross to the opposite in the medulla and descend ipsilaterally as anterior (ventral) coicospinal tract.The most impressive fibers in the pyramidal tract are a population of large (16 pm) myelinated fibers which originate from Giant pyramidal cells, called Betz cells, that are found only in primary motor coex. These fibers transmit the nerve impulses to the spinal cord at fastest speed. However, these fibers form only 3% of the total. The other 97% are mainly fibers smaller than 4 m in diameter that conduct background tonic signals to the motor areas of the cord.Coricospinal tract is concerned with voluntary activities of body- Voluntary control of movement is absolutely dependent on the activity of coicospinal fibers.",

Erythropoietin can also be extracted from the spleen and salivary glands, but these tissues do not contain the mRNA and consequently do not appear to manufacture the hormone.When renal mass is reduced in adults by renal disease or nephrectomy, the liver cannot compensate and anemia develops. Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial cells in the peritubular capillary bed of the kidneys and by perivenous hepatocytes in the liver. It is also produced in the brain, where it exes a protective effect against excitotoxic damage triggered by hypoxia; and in the uterus and oviducts, where it is induced by estrogen and appears to mediate estrogen-dependent angiogenesis.",

The vasodilatory chemical stimuli are low PO2, High PCO2, H+, K+, lactic acid, ADP AMP and adenosine. Chemical regulation (autoregulation) of coronary blood flow is far more impoant than neural regulation.2) Neural regulationCoronary aeries are supplied by autonomic sympathetic and parasympathetic system. Coronary aeries have both alpha and beta sympathetic (adrenergic receptors), with the beta receptors predominating. Beta receptor stimulation produces vasodilation whereas alpha receptor stimulation produces vasoconstriction. There are relatively few parasympathetic (vagal) fibers supplying the coronary aeries. The direct effect of these fibers is vasodilatation; But indirect effect causes vasoconstriction and predominates. Indirect effect is the result of decrease in formation of vasodilator metabolites due to decrease in hea rate and cardiac contractility.",

Although the PaO2 is normal in anemic hypoxia, the absolute quantity of O2 transpoed per unit volume of blood is diminished. As the anemic blood passes through the capillaries and the usual quantity of O2 is removed from it, the PO2 and saturation in the venous blood decline to a greater extent than normal. Must Know: Classification of hypoxia: Hypoxic hypoxia, in which the PO2 of the aerial blood is reduced. Anemic hypoxia, in which the aerial PO2 is normal but the amount of hemoglobin available to carry O2 is reduced. Ischemic or stagnant hypoxia, in which the blood flow to a tissue is so low that adequate O2 is not delivered to it despite a normal PO2 and hemoglobin concentration.

Its effect on the breast involves increased action of mRNA and increased production of casein and lactalbumin. Prolactin also inhibits the effects of gonadotropins, possibly by an action at the level of the ovary. The function of prolactin in normal males is unsettled, but excess prolactin secreted by tumors causes impotence. Remember oxytocin causes Ejection of milk.",

Binding of neurotransmitters to the receptors mediating presynaptic inhibition leads to a reduction in the amount of neurotransmitter secreted by the postsynaptic axon. This reduction is caused either by a decrease in the size of the action potential in the presynaptic terminal as a result of activation of K+ or Cl- channels or by reduced opening of Ca2+ channels in the presynaptic terminal, thereby decreasing the amount of transmitter release. Presynaptic inhibition thus provides a mechanism whereby the \"gain\" at a paicular synaptic input to a neuron can be reduced without reducing the efficacy of other synapses that impinge on that neuron.

Climbing fibers which brings information only from the inferior olivary nuclei and establish excitatory synapes with purkinje cells. All other afferent input to the cerebellum is brought by the other types of fibers, called Mossy fibers which establish excitatory synapse with granule cells in the granular cell layer. The axon of granule cells, called parallel fibers, stimulate the purkinje cells. Thus mossy fibers, like the climbing fibers, also end up in stimulating the purkinje cells.Granule cells are the only stimulatory (excitatory) cells in cerebellar coex.The parallel fibers (axons of granule cells) also stimulate three types of interneurons :- Stellate and basket cells in the molecular layer, and Golgi cells in the granular layer. Stellate and basket cells inhibit purkinje cells. Golgi cells, also activated by collateral from mossy fibers (besides parallel fibers), inhibit transmission from mossy fibers to granule cells.Overall, climbing fiber inputs exe a strong excitatory effect on a single purkinje cell, Whereas mossy fiber inputs exe a weak excitatory effect on many purkinje cells the granule cells.After complex inhibiting and excitatory interactions of various fibers and cells in the coex, the output of cerebellar coex, is projected to deep cerebellar nuclei by axons of pyramidal cells (only output cells of cerebellar coex). The output of the Purkinje cells is inhibitory to the deep cerebellar nuclei. However, the output of deep cerebellar nuclei to the brain stem and thalamus is always excitatory because, beside inhibitory inputs of purkinje cells, deep cerebellar nuclei also receive excitatory inputs from afferent mossy and climbing fibers which usually are more prominent.",

        "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to his doctor with complaints of left-sided flank pain radiating into his groin. The pain began suddenly and has increased in intensity. He had a similar problem several years ago, but he did not seek medical attention, and his symptoms resolved spontaneously. He denies fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. He has had no diarrhea or difficulty urinating. Physical examination is remarkable for tenderness along the left flank and into the groin, but is otherwise normal. There are no inguinal hernias detected on examination. A urinalysis reveals microscopic hematuria without casts. Serum chemistry reveals: Sodium: 143 mEq/L Potassium: 2.4 mEq/L Bicarbonate: 17 mEq/L Chloride: 115 mEq/L Blood urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL Glucose: 85 mg/dL Which of the following represents this patient's anion gap?",
        "exp": "The concept of the anion gap is based on the idea that all the charges in a solution must add to zero, since the solution is electrically neutral. In practice, people just take the two principal cations, Na+ and K+, and the two principal anions, Cl- and HCO3-, and subtract the sum of the anions from the sum of the cations. When the correct formula is used, the anion gap is (+)-(+) = 143 + 2.4 - (17 + 115) = 13.4 mEq/L, which is within the normal range of 10-20 mEq/L when this formula is used for the calculation. (Some authors \"cheat\" even fuher and ignore the K+ as well, which works on the same principal, but produces a slightly different reference range of values.) The anion gap is due to the excess amount of unmeasured anions in the serum, when compared to the unmeasured cations. Ref: Stern S.C., Cifu A.S., Altkorn D. (2010). Chapter 4.

A vector (arrow) points in direction of the electrical potential generated by the current flow, with the arrowhead in the positive direction. The length of arrow is drawn propoional to the voltage of the potential. This is called resultant vector in the hea at a given instant.At the instant of paial depolarization of ventricles (septum & apical endocardial walls shown by negative signs and shaded area), the electrical current flows between the depolarized areas inside the hea and non-depolarized areas on the outside of hea (shown by long elliptical arrows). Overall, far more current flows downward from the base of ventricle toward the apex than in upward direction. So instantaneous mean vector (i.e.) the summated vector of generated potential at this paicular instant) during septal depolarization is represented by the long black arrow drawn through the centre of the ventricles in a direction from base toward apexQ.Directions of vector: When a vector is exactly horizontal and directed towards the person's left side, the vector is said to extend in the direction of 0 degree . From this 0deg reference point, the scale of vector direction rotates clockwise. So when the vector extends from above to veically straight downward, it is in the direction of 90deg. When it extends from person's left to right the direction is 180deg; and when it extends straight upwards, it has a direction of -90deg (or + 270deg).Direction of VectorMean QRS vector: is the average direction of the vector during spread of the depolarization wave through ventricles. In a normal hea it is about +59deg which means that during most of depolarization the apex of heat remains positive with respect to the base of hea.If it is assumed that three ECG electrode locations form the points of an equilateral triangle (Einthoven's triangle) and the hea lies in the centre of this triangle; the vector at any given movement in two dimensions of frontal plane can be calculated from any two standard limb leads.Mean QRS vector (electrical axis of heat) is plotted by using the average QRS deflection in each lead (or by measuring the net differences between the positive of negative peaks of QRS). The normal direction of mean QRS vector is -30deg to +110deg. Left axis detion is present if calculated axis falls to left of -30deg and may be d/t left ventricular hyperophy. Right axis detion is present if axis falls to the right of +110deg and suggests right ventricular hyperophy.",

Which of the following is the most likely physiologic explanation for the serum sodium?",
        "exp": "Gastrointestinal tract fluids have a sodium concentration very close to that of plasma; as they are lost (internally or externally), they should be replaced with isotonic, sodium-containing fluids. But that is not what patients typically do at home. Thirsty and unable to eat solid (sodium-containing) foods, they drink water, Coke, and tea, fluids without significant amounts of sodium, which the body avidly retains because of the severe volume depletion. Endogenous water from catabolic activity is also retained. Dilutional hyponatremia eventually develops. She does not have \"water intoxication\" . This term denotes abnormal water retention due to excessive water infusion at a time when there is a high level of ADH in the blood. This patient is retaining water because she is desperately volume-depleted, not because high volumes of water are being forced into her. The hyponatremia is not due to the loss of hypeonic fluid . There are no hypeonic fluids in the gut, or anywhere else for that matter. The only hypeonic fluid that we can lose is highly concentrated urine, but we usually do so as a physiologic response to save water. Yes, we often see comatose and convulsing patients when they have this much hyponatremia , but that happens when water retention is massive and fast. Slow water retention allows the brain to adapt. One can see even lower serum sodium concentrations in patients with a clear sensorium. Ref: Molina P.E. (2013). Chapter 10. Endocrine Integration of Energy and Electrolyte Balance. In P.E.

This binding is facilitated by heparin, a naturally occurring anticoagulant that is a mixture of sulfated polysaccharides with molecular weights averaging 15,000-18,000. The clotting factors that are inhibited are the active forms of factors IX, X, XI, and XII. The endothelium of the blood vessels also plays an active role in preventing the extension of clots into blood vessels. All endothelial cells except those in the cerebral microcirculation produce thrombomodulin, a thrombin-binding protein. In the circulating blood, thrombin is a procoagulant that activates factors V and VIII, but when it binds to thrombomodulin, it becomes an anticoagulant in that the thrombomodulin-thrombin complex activates protein C .

Theca cells are stimulated by LH (theca cells express LH receptors prior to formation of the corpus luteum, choice D) to secrete the androgens androstenedione and testosterone. The androgens then diffuse into the granulosa cells, where they are aromatized to estrogens. Hence, theca cells express side-chain cleavage enzyme (first step in steroidogenesis) prior to the formation of the corpus luteum . FSH stimulates aromatase activity in the granulosa cells (receptors for FSH and aromatase enzyme are present prior to the formation of the corpus luteum, choices A and B). The granulosa cells apparently have the ability to produce steroids (progesterone), but lack 17a-hydroxylase activity and cannot synthesize estrogen themselves. Only as the follicle approaches ovulation do LH receptors begin to be expressed by the granulosa cells. Estrogen and FSH probably are responsible for the change. After ovulation, the scar of the follicle undergoes luteinization. The theca cells decrease 17a-hydroxylase activity and secrete more progesterone.

B: Transferrin Transferrin/siderophilin binds the iron in the lumen of GIT and most of the iron is transpoed bound to this globulin across the mucosal brush border Transferrin They are iron-binding blood plasma glycoproteins that control the level of free iron in biological fluids. In humans, it is encoded by the TF gene. Transferrin is a glycoprotein that binds iron very tightly but reversibly. Although iron bound to transferrin is less than 0.1% (4 mg) of the total body iron, it is the most impoant iron pool, with the highest rate of turnover. Transferrin has a molecular weight of around 80 kDa and contains 2 specific high-affinity Fe (III) binding sites. The affinity of transferrin for Fe (III) is extremely high but decreases progressively with decreasing pH below neutrality. When not bound to iron, it is known as \"apo-transferrin\" Ferritin It is a ubiquitous intracellular protein that stores iron and releases it in a controlled fashion. The amount of ferritin stored reflects the amount of iron stored. In humans, it acts as a buffer against iron deficiency and iron overload. Ferritin is a globular protein complex consisting of 24 protein subunits and is the primary intracellular iron-storage protein in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, keeping iron in a soluble and non-toxic form.

It is secreted by type II alveolar epithelial cells and lines the alveoli. Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. The water molecules lining the alveoli produce an elastic contractile force due to surface tension which causes the alveoli to collapse. This surface tension force of water molecules is broken by surfactant. In spherical structures like an alveolus, the distending pressure equals two times the tension divided by the radius (P = 2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure. Surfactant also helps to prevent pulmonary edema. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 34. Introduction to Pulmonary Structure and Mechanics. In K.E. Barrett, S.M.

Pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs in response to alveolar hypoxia; therefore, the diameter of the pulmonary vessels would be greater in the brother living at sea level. All the other choices describe physiologic processes that would be enhanced by living at high altitude. Increased erythropoietin production, caused by aerial hypoxia, leads to increases in hematocrit in people living at high altitude. Mitochondrial density increases in people chronically exposed to the hypoxemia caused by living at high altitude. Increasing the rate of respiration is a very useful adaptation to the hypoxic conditions of high altitude. The primary stimulus is the hypoxic stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors.

These secretions (polypeptide) are stored in the golgi apparatus and also concentrated, processed and packed.

Membrane vesicles containing newly synthesized protein bud off from the rough ER and fuse with Cis (Convex) side of Golgi apparatus, i.e., Cis end is the receiving end. This protein is then process through Golgi apparatus to reach the trans (concave) side, from which vesicles bud off into the cytoplasm and are finally exocytosed from the cell.

When the first oxygen is bound, the bonds holding the globin units are released, producing a relaxed (R) configuration which exposes more oxygen binding sites. Thus, binding of one oxygen molecule increases the affinity of hemoglobin to bind other O2 molecules.

Before Loewi's experiments, it was unclear whether signalling across the synapse was bioelectrical or chemical. Loewi's famous experiment, published in 1921, largely answered this question. He dissected out of frogs two beating heas: one with the vagus nerve which controls hea rate attached, the other hea on its own. Both heas were bathed in a saline solution (i.e. Ringer's solution). By electrically stimulating the vagus nerve, Loewi made the first hea beat slower. Then, Loewi took some of the liquid bathing the first hea and applied it to the second hea. The application of the liquid made the second hea also beat slower, proving that some soluble chemical released by the vagus nerve was controlling the hea rate. He called the unknown chemical Vagusstoff. It was later found that this chemical corresponded to Acetylcholine",

        "exp": "Stimulation of Gluconeogenesis: The best-known metabolic effect of cortisol and other glucocorticoids on metabolism is the ability to stimulate gluconeogenesis (i.e., the formation of carbohydrate\u00a0 from\u00a0 proteins\u00a0 and some other substances) by the liver, often increasing the rate of gluconeogenesis as much as 6 to 10fold.\u00a0\u00a0\nCortisol Increases Liver and Plasma Proteins: Coincidentally with the effect of glucocorticoids to reduce proteins elsewhere in the body, the liver proteins are increased. Furthermore, the plasma proteins (which are produced by the liver and then released into the blood) are also increased.\nMobilization of Fatty Acids: In much the same manner that cortisol promotes amino acid mobilization from muscle, it also promotes mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue.\nEffect on Blood Cells and on Immunity in Infectious Diseases: Cortisol decreases the number of eosinophils and lymphocytes in the blood; this effect begins within a few minutes after the injection of cortisol and becomes marked within a few hours. Indeed, a finding of lymphocytopenia or eosinopenia is an important diagnostic criterion for overproduction of cortisol by the adrenal gland.\nKey Concept:\nCortisol decreases circulating basophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes. All other cell count increases in cortisol treated person.\nReference: GUYTON AND HALL TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, THIRTEENTH EDITION(INTERNATIONAL EDITION ) page no 972,973,974, 976",
