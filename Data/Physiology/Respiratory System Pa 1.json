FRC increases with age. This is due to decreased elastic recoil and greater dynamic compression of airways. More amount of air is trapped in lungs at the end of expiration. Hence, option C is the answer. PO2 decreases with age. Decreased elastic recoil combined with dynamic compression results in early airway closure, mainly in the dependent airways. Hence, ventilation would be greater at the apex, the region which is normally less ventilated. It results in a VA/Q inequality, causing decreased PO2.
