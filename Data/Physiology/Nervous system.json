        "exp": "The baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is one of the body's homeostatic mechanisms that help to maintain blood pressure at nearly constant levels. The baroreflex provides a rapid negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes the hea rate to decrease and also causes blood pressure to decrease. Decreased blood pressure decreases baroreflex activation and causes hea rate to increase and to restore blood pressure levels. The baroreflex can begin to act in less than the duration of a cardiac cycle (fractions of a second) and thus baroreflex adjustments are key factors in dealing with postural hypotension, the tendency for blood pressure to decrease on standing due to gravity. The baroreceptors are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors. At low pressures, baroreceptors become inactive. When blood pressure rises, the carotid and aoic sinuses are distended fuher, resulting in increased stretch and, therefore, a greater degree of activation of the baroreceptors. At normal resting blood pressures, many baroreceptors are actively repoing blood pressure information and the baroreflex is actively modulating autonomic activity. Active baroreceptors fire action potentials (\"spikes\") more frequently. The greater the stretch the more rapidly baroreceptors fire action potentials. Many individual baroreceptors are inactive at normal resting pressures and only become activated when their stretch or pressure threshold is exceeded.

The average nerve trunk contains about twice asmany unmyelinated fibers as myelinated fibers. The central core of the fiber is the axon, and the membrane of the axon is the membrane that actually conducts the action potential. The axon is filled in its center with axoplasm, which is a viscid intracellular fluid. Surrounding the axon is a myelin sheath that is often much thicker than the axon itself. About once every 1 to 3 millimeters along the length of the myelin sheath is a node of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is deposited around the axon by Schwann cells in the following manner: The membrane of a Schwann cell first envelops the axon. The Schwann cellthen rotates around the axon many times, laying down multiple layers of Schwann cell membrane containing the lipid substance sphingomyelin. This substance is an excellent electrical insulator that decreases ion flow through the membrane about 5000-fold. At the juncture between each two successive Schwann cells along the axon, a small uninsulated area only 2 to 3 micrometers in length remains where ions still can flow with ease through the axon membrane between the extracellular fluid and the intracellular fluid inside the axon. This area is called the node of Ranvier.Ref: Guyton and Hall textbook medical physiology, 13th edition.",

        "exp": "Removal of the cerebral coex (Decoication) produces decoicate rigidity which is characterized by flexion of the upper extremities at the elbow and extensor hyperactivity in the lower extremities. The flexion can be explained by Rubio spinal excitation of flexor muscles in the upper extremities; the hyperextension of lower extremities is due to the same changes that occur after mid-collicular decerebration. Decoicate rigidity is seen on the hemiplegic side in humans after hemorrhages or thromboses in the internal capsule. Probably because of their anatomy, the small aeries in the internal capsule are especially prone to rupture or thrombotic obstruction, so this type of decoicate rigidity is fairly common. Sixty percent of intracerebral hemorrhages occur in the internal capsule, as opposed to 10% in the cerebral coex, 10% in the pons, 10% in the thalamus, and 10% in the cerebellum.Reference: Ganong review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 247",

Intrafusal fibers do not contribute to the overall contractile force of the muscle, but rather serve a pure sensory function. There are two types of intrafusal fibers in mammalian muscle spindles. The first type contains many nuclei in a dilated central area and is called a nuclear bag fiber (Figure 9-2B). There are two subtypes of nuclear bag fibers, dynamic and static. Typically, there are two or three nuclear bag fibers per spindle. The second intrafusal fiber type, the nuclear chain fiber, is thinner and shoer and lacks a definite bag. Each spindle has about five of these fibers. There are two kinds of sensory endings in each spindle, a single primary (group Ia) ending and up to eight secondary (group II) endings. The Ia afferent fiber wraps around the center of the dynamic and static nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers. Group II sensory fibers are located adjacent to the centers of the static nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibers; these fibers do not innervate the dynamic nuclear bag fibers. Ia afferents are very sensitive to the velocity of the change in muscle length during a stretch (dynamic response); thus they provide information about the speed of movements and allow for quick corrective movements. The steady-state (tonic) activity of group Ia and II afferents provide information on steady-state length of the muscle (static response). The top trace in Figure 9-2C shows the dynamic and static components of activity in an Ia afferent during muscle stretch. Note that they discharge most rapidly while the muscle is being stretched (shaded)Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 158",

This rigidity does not occur in all the muscles of the body, but it does occur in the antigravity muscles-- the muscles of the neck and trunk and the extensors ofthe legs.The cause of decerebrate rigidity is blockage of normally strong input to the medullary reticular nuclei from the cerebral coex, the red nuclei, and the basal ganglia.Lacking this input, the medullary reticular inhibitor system becomes nonfunctional, full overactivity of the pontine excitatory system occurs, and rigidity develops.Guyton 13th edition Pg: 714",

        "exp": "The AVP that is measured in peripheral blood is almost all derived from secretion from the posterior pituitary gland (except in cases of AVP-secreting tumours). Vasopressin is produced by magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) and Supraoptic nucleus (SON). It then travels down the axon through the infundibulum within neurosecretory granules that are found within Herring bodies, localized swellings of the axons and nerve terminals. These carry the peptide directly to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored until released into the blood. However, there are two other sources of AVP with impoant local effects:AVP is also synthesized by magnocellular neurosecretory neurons at the PVN, transpoed and released at the median eminence, which then travels through the hypophyseal poal system to the anterior pituitary where it stimulates coicotropic cells synergistically with CRH to produce ACTH (by itself it is a weak secretagogue).Vasopressin is also released into the brain by several different populations of smaller patterns.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology, 23rd edition, Page no:667",

This cascade (phototransduction cascade) in rods is now rather well understood at the molecular level in a quantitative way. In cones, similar cascade has been known to be present.

In dogs and other animals in which the sense of smell is highly developed (macrosmatic animals), the area covered by this membrane is large; in microsmatic animals, such as humans, it is small. In humans, it covers an area of 5 cm2 in the roof of the nasal cavity near the septum (Figure 14-1). The human olfactory epi- thelium contains 10 to 20 million bipolar olfactory sensory neurons interspersed with glia-like suppoing (sustentacular) cells and basal stem cells. The olfactory epithelium is said to be the place in the body where the nervous system is closest to the external world. Each neuron has a sho, thick dendrite that projects into the nasal cavity where it terminates in a knob containing 10 to 20 cilia (Figure 14-2). The cilia are unmyelinated processes about 2 mm long and 0.1 mm in diameter and contain specific receptors for odorants (odorant receptors). The axons of the olfactory sensory neurons pass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and enter the olfactory bulbs (Figure 14-1). New olfactory sensory neurons are generated by basal stem cells as needed to replace those damaged by exposure to the environment. The olfactory renewal process is carefully regulated, and there is evidence that in this situation a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) exes an inhibitory effect. BMPs are a large family of growth factors originally described as promoters of bone growth but now known to act on most tissues in the body during development, including many types of nerve cells.Ref: Ganon pg.no219",

It acts as a barrier between the extracellular and intracellular compaments, defining the individual muscle fiber from its surroundings. The lipid nature of the membrane allows it to separate the fluids of the intra- and extracellular compaments since it is only selectively permeable to water through aquaporin channels. As in other cells, this allows for the compositions of the compaments to be controlled by selective transpo through the membrane. Membrane proteins, such as ion pumps, may create ion gradients with the consumption of ATP, that may later be used to drive transpo of other substances through the membrane (Co-transpo) or generate electrical impulses such as Action potentials. Perlecan is a key component of the vascular extracellular matrix, here it interacts with a variety of other matrix components and helps to maintain the endothelial barrier function. Perlecan is a potent inhibitor of smooth muscle cell proliferation and is thus thought to help maintain vascular homeostasis. Perlecan can also promote growth factor (e.g., FGF2) activity and thus stimulate endothelial growth and regeneration.

Damage to the proprioceptive nerves does not allow the cerebellum to accurately judge where the hand, arm, leg, or eye should move. There are two types of cerebellar disorders that produce dysmetria, specifically midline cerebellar syndromes and hemispheric cerebellar syndromes. Midline cerebellar syndromes can cause ocular dysmetria, Hemispheric cerebellar syndromes cause dysmetria in the typical motor sense that many think of when hearing the term dysmetria.

They occur in very deep sleep, in infancy, and in persons with serious organic brain disease. They also occur in the coex of animals that have had subcoical transactions in which the cerebral coex is separated from the thalamus. Therefore, delta waves can occur strictly in the coex independent of activities in lower regions ofthe brain. Delta waves also occur during deep slow-wave sleep, which suggests that the coex then is mainly released from the activating influences of the thalamus and other lower centers. Slow-wave sleep is divided into four stages. In the first stage, a stage of light sleep, the voltage of the EEG waves becomes low. This stage is broken by \"sleep spindles\" (i.e., sho spindle-shaped bursts of alpha waves that occur periodically). In stages 2, 3, and 4 of slow-wave sleep, the frequency of the EEG becomes progressively slower until it reaches a frequency of only one to three waves per second in stage 4; these waves are delta waves.Ref: Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology, 13th edition.",

It primarily affects the motor nerves in the spinal cord which control muscle contraction. An impulse is triggered at one end of a nerve by the binding of neurotransmitters to the receptors. In the presence of a neuroinhibitor, such as glycine, a greater quantity of excitatory neurotransmitters must bind to receptors before there will be an action potential generated. Glycine acts primarily as an agonist of the glycine receptor, which is a ligand-gated chloride channel in neurons located in the spinal cord and in the brain. This chloride channel will allow the negatively charged chloride ions into the neuron, causing a hyperpolarization which pushes the membrane potential fuher from threshold. Strychnine is an antagonist of glycine, which means it binds to the same receptor, preventing the inhibitory effects of glycine on the postsynaptic neuron. Therefore, action potentials are triggered with lower levels of excitatory neurotransmitters. When the inhibitory signals are prevented, the motor neurons are more easily activated and the victim will have spastic muscle contractions, resulting in death by asphyxiation.

A-wave: initial corneal-negative deflection, derived from the cones and rods of the outer photoreceptor layers. This wave reflects the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptors due to closure of sodium ion channels in the outer segment membrane. Absorption of light triggers the rhodopsin to activate transducin, a G-protein. This leads to the activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (cGMP PDE) eventually leading to a reduction in the level of cGMP within the photoreceptor. This leads to closure of the sodium ion channels resulting in a decrease of inwardly directed sodium ions, or a hyperpolarization of the cell.

Parasympathetic branches extend from the sacral plexus into the aeries supplying the erectile tissue; upon stimulation, these nerve branches release acetylcholine, which, in turn, causes release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells in the trabecular aeries. Nitric oxide diffuses to the smooth muscle of the aeries (called trabecular smooth muscle), acting as a vasodilating agent. The aeries dilate, filling the corpora spongiosum and cavernosa with blood. The ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles also compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa, limiting the venous drainage of blood. Erection subsides when parasympathetic stimulation is discontinued; baseline stimulation from the sympathetic division of the ANS causes constriction of the penile aeries, forcing blood out of the erectile tissue. After ejaculation or cessation of stimulation, erection usually subsides, but the time taken may vary depending on the length and thickness of the penis. Voluntary and involuntary control The cerebral coex can initiate erection in the absence of direct mechanical stimulation (in response to visual, auditory, olfactory, imagined, or tactile stimuli) acting through erectile centers in the lumbar and sacral regions of the spinal cord. The coex may suppress erection, even in the presence of mechanical stimulation, as may other psychological, emotional, and environmental factors.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 405",

They are large, myelinated nerve endings. They provide information on pressure, position, and deep static touch features such as shapes and edges. Merkel cells in the basal epidermis of the skin store neuropeptides which they release to associated nerve endings in response to pressure. In burns, Merkel endings are most commonly lost. Each ending consists of a Merkel cell in close apposition with an enlarged nerve terminal. This is sometimes referred to as a Merkel cell-neurite complex, or a Merkel disk receptor. In mammals, Merkel nerve endings have a wide distribution. Merkel nerve endings are found in the basal layer of glabrous and hairy skin, in hair follicles, and in oral and anal mucosa. In humans, Merkel cells (along with Meissner's corpuscles) occur in the superficial skin layers and are found clustered beneath the ridges of the fingeips that make up fingerprints. In hairy skin, Merkel nerve endings are clustered into specialized epithelial structures called \"touch domes\" or \"hair disks\". (Some other types of mechanoreceptors, such as Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings, are found primarily in subcutaneous tissue.) Merkel receptors are also located in the mammary glands. Wherever they are found, the epithelium is arranged to optimize the transfer of pressure to the ending. Ref: guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition page number:698,699,700",

        "question": "All of the following functions are associated with myelination except",
        "exp": "The main purpose of a myelin layer (or sheath) is to increase the speed at which impulses propagate along the myelinated fiber. Along unmyelinated fibers, impulses move continuously as waves, but, in myelinated fibers, they \"hop\" or propagate by saltatory conduction. Myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane (the axolemma). Thus, myelination helps prevent the electric current from leaving the axon. It has been suggested that myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication between distant body pas.Myelinated fibers lack voltage-gated ion channels (approximately 25 mm-2) along the myelinated internodes, exposing them only at the nodes of Ranvier. Here, they are found far more abundantly (between 2,000 and 12,000 mm-2). Myelinated fibers succeed in reducing sodium leakage into the extracellular fluid (ECF), maintaining a strong separation of charge between the intracellular fluid (ICF) and the ECF. This increases sodium's ability to travel along the axon more freely. However, the sodium diffuses along the axolemma rapidly but is decremental by nature. The sodium cannot trigger the opening of the voltage-gated sodium channels as it becomes weaker. The nodes of Ranvier, being exposed to the ECF every 1 mm or so, contain large amounts of voltage-gated sodium channels and allow enough sodium into the axon to regenerate the action potential. Each time the action potential reaches a node of Ranvier, it is restored to its original action potential (+35 mV).When a peripheral fiber is severed, the myelin sheath provides a track along which regrowth can occur. However, the myelin layer does not ensure a perfect regeneration of the nerve fiber. Some regenerated nerve fibers do not find the correct muscle fibers, and some damaged motor neurons of the peripheral nervous system die without regrowth. Damage to the myelin sheath and nerve fiber is often associated with increased functional insufficiency.Unmyelinated fibers and myelinated axons of the mammalian central nervous system do not regenerate.Some studies have revealed that optic nerve fibers can be regenerated in postnatal rats. This regeneration depends upon two conditions: axonal die-back has to be prevented with appropriate neurotrophic factors, and neurite growth inhibitory components have to be inactivated. These studies may lead to fuher understanding of nerve fiber regeneration in the central nervous system.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology, 23rd edition, Page no:82",

Dorsal horn neurons receive sensory information from primary afferents that innervate the skin and deeper tissues of the body and that respond to specific types of noxious and non-noxious stimuli. These afferents terminate in the dorsal horn with a distribution pattern that is determined by their sensory modality and the region of the body that they innervate. The incoming information is processed by complex circuits involving excitatory and inhibitory interneurons and transmitted to projection neurons for relay to several brain areas. In addition, nociceptive information is conveyed to the ventral horn and contributes to spinally-mediated nocifensive reflexes.

In this procedure, the two points on a pair of calipers are simultaneously positioned on the skin and one determines the minimum distance between the two caliper points that can be perceived as separate points of stimulation. This is called the two-point discrimination threshold.If the distance is very small, each caliper point touches the receptive field of only one sensory neuron. If the distance between stimulation points is less than this threshold, only one point of stimulation can be felt. Thus, the two-point discrimination threshold is a measure of tactile acuity. The magnitude of two-point discrimination thresholds varies from place to place on the body and is smallest where touch receptors are most abundant.Stimulus points on the back, for instance, must be separated by at least 65 mm before they can be distinguished as separate, whereas on the fingeips two stimuli are recognized if they are separated by as little as 2 mm. Blind individuals benefit from the tactile acuity of fingeips to facilitate the ability to read Braille; the dots forming Braille symbols are separated by 2.5 mm. Two-point discrimination is used to test the integrity of the dorsal column (medial lemniscus) system, the central pathway for touch and proprioception.",

        "exp": "The degree to which a person reacts to pain varies tremendously. This variation results paly from a capability of the brain itself to suppress input of pain signals to thenervous system by activating a pain control system called an analgesia system. The analgesia system consists of three major components: (1) The periaqueductal gray and periventricular areas of the mesencephalon and upper pons surround the aqueduct of Sylvius and poions of the third and fouh ventricles. Neurons from these areas send signals to (2) the raphe magnus nucleus, a thin midline nucleus located in the lower pons and upper medulla, and the nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis, located laterally in the medulla. From these nuclei, second-order signals are transmitted down the dorsolateral columns in the spinal cord to (3) a pain inhibitory complex located in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord. At this point, the analgesia signals can block the pain before it is relayed to the brain. Ref: guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition page number:698,699,700",
