        "exp": "The stomach also adds a significant volume of digestive juices to the meal. Like salivary secretion, the stomach actually readies itself to receive the meal before it is actually taken in, during the so-called cephalic phase that can be influenced by food preferences. The gastric secretions arise from glands in the wall of the stomach that drain into its lumen, and also from the surface cells that secrete primarily mucus and bicarbonate to protect the stomach from digesting itself, as well as substances known as trefoil peptides that stabilize the mucus-bicarbonate layer. The glandular secretions of the stomach differ in different regions of the organ. The most characteristic secretions derive from the glands in the fundus or body of the stomach. These contain two distinctive cell types from which the gastric secretions arise: the parietal cells, which secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor; and the chief cells, which produce pepsinogens and gastric lipase. The acid secreted by parietal cells serves to sterilize the meal and also to begin the hydrolysis of dietary macromolecules. Intrinsic factor is impoant for the later absorption ofvitamin B12 or cobalamin. Pepsinogen is the precursor of pepsin, which initiates protein digestion. Lipase similarly begins the digestion of dietary fats.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:432",

        "question": "Following acute failure of the left ventricle is the hea is man, pulmonary edema generally begins to appear when left atrial pressure approaches",
        "exp": "Pulmonary edema is one of the most serious consequences of left ventricular cardiac failure. When the left ventricle fails or when the mitral valve fails, left atrial pressure (LAP) may increase substantially. The resulting increase in pulmonary capillary pressure (Pc) forces excess fluid filtration through the pulmonary capillary walls and into the lung tissue. At first, the fluid collects within the lung interstitial space. If LAP exceeds a critical level of ~25 mmHg, the volume of edema fluid will overwhelm the capacity of the interstitial spaces and fluid will flood the airways and alveoli (8). This airway edema directly interferes with gas exchange, and it can kill the patient. However, many people live for months or years with modestly elevated LAP (<25 mmHg). We believe that sustained, subcritical LAP elevations lead to two phases of change in the lungs. The first phase is the acute edema that develops in the first few hours of elevated LAP. The second phase concerns the effect of long-term (7 days or more) increases in LAP below the critical level. This review deals with the acute phase and long-term phase changes in the lung caused by modestly elevated LAP. The acute phase of pulmonary edema has been the subject of intense investigation for many years. In 1896, Starling (7) laid the foundation for our current understanding of pulmonary edema with his famous fluid filtration equation. The equation relates the rate of fluid filtration through the capillary wall (Jv) to the pressures across the capillary wall and to the filtration characteristics of the capillary membrane Ref: guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition",

Bowel flora has also been given the credit for synthesizing several vitamins. These vitamins include vitamin K, cyanocobalamin, folate, pyridoxine, biotin, pantothenate, and riboflavin.

        "question": "Which causes antral gastrin release?",
        "exp": "Gastrin is produced by cells called G cells in the antral poion of the gastric mucosa.G cells are flask-shaped, with a broad base containing many gastrin granules and a narrow apex that reaches the mucosal surface. Microvilli project from the apical end into the lumen. Receptors mediating gastrin responses to changes in gastric contents are present on the microvilli. Other cells in the gastrointestinal tract that secrete hormones have a similar morphology. Gastrin is typical of a number of polypeptide hormones in that it shows both microheterogeneity and microheterogeneity. Microheterogeneity refers to the occurrence in tissues and body fluids of peptide chains of various lengths; microheterogeneity refers to differences in molecular structure due to derivatization of single amino acid residues. preprogastrin is processed into fragments of various sizes. Three main fragments contain 34, 17, and 14 amino acid residues. All have the same carboxyl terminal configuration. In large doses, gastrin has a variety of actions, but its principal physiologic actions are stimulation of gastric acid and pepsin secretion and stimulation of the growth of the mucosa of the stomach and small and large intestines (trophic action). Gastrin secretion is affected by the contents of the stomach, the rate of discharge of the vagus nerves, and bloodborne factors. Atropine does not inhibit the gastrin response to a test meal in humans, because the transmitter secreted by the postganglionic vagal fibers that innervate the G cells is gastrin-releasing polypeptide rather than acetylcholine. Gastrin secretion is also increased by the presence of the products of protein digestion in the stomach, paicularly amino acids, which act directly on the G cells. Phenylalanine and tryptophan are paicularly effective. The acid in the antrum inhibits gastrin secretion, paly by a direct action on G cells and paly by release of somatostatin, a relatively potent inhibitor of gastric secretion. The effect of acid is the basis of a negative feedback loop regulating gastrin secretion. Increased secretion of the hormone increases acid secretion, but the acid then feeds back to inhibit fuher gastrin secretion. In conditions such as pernicious anemia in which the acid-secreting cells of the stomach are damaged, gastrin secretion is chronically elevated.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:443",

The mean increase in colonic tone postprandially was significantly greater in the transverse (24.1% (3.5)) than in the sigmoid colon (13.1% (3.0), p < 0.01).

        "exp": "Bile is made up of the bile acids, bile pigments, and other substances dissolved in an alkaline electrolyte solution that resembles pancreatic juice. About 500 mL issecreted per day. Some of the components of the bile are reabsorbed in the intestine and then excreted again by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The glucuronides of the bile pigments, bilirubin, and biliverdin, are responsible for the golden yellow color of bile. bile acids secreted into the bile are conjugated to glycineor taurine, a derivative of cysteine. The bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol. The two principal (primary) bile acids formed in the liver are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. In the colon, bacteria conve cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid to lithocholic acid. In addition, small quantities of ursodeoxycholic acid are formed from chenodeoxycholic acid. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a tautomer of chenodeoxycholic acid at the 7-position. Because they are formed by bacterial action, deoxycholic, lithocholic, and ursodeoxycholic acids are called secondary bile acids. The bile salts have a number of impoant actions: theyreduce surface tension and, in conjunction with phospholipids and monoglycerides, are responsible for the emulsification of fat preparatory to its digestion and absorption in the small intestine. They are amphipathic, that is, they have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains; one surface of the molecule is hydrophilic because the polar peptide bond and the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are on that surface, whereas the other surface is hydrophobic. Therefore, the bile salts tend to form cylindrical disks called micelles. Their hydrophilic poions face out and their hydrophobic poions face in. Above a ceain concentration, called the critical micelle concentration, all bile salts added to a solution form micelles. Lipids collect in the micelles, with cholesterol in the hydrophobic center and amphipathic phospholipids and monoglycerides lined up with their hydrophilic heads on the outside and their hydrophobic tails in the center. The micelles play an impoant role in keeping lipids in solution and transpoing them to the brush border of the intestinal epithelial cells, where they are absorbed. Ninety to 95% of the bile salts are absorbed from the small intestine. Once they are deconjugated, they can be absorbed by nonionic diffusion, but most are absorbed in their conjugated forms from the terminal ileum (Figure 26-18) by an extremely efficient Na+ -bile salt cotranspo system powered by basolateral Na+-K+ATPase. The remaining 5-10% of thebile salts enter the colon and are conveed to the salts of deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. Lithocholate is relatively insoluble and is mostly excreted in the stools; only 1% is absorbed. However, deoxycholate is absorbed. The absorbed bile salts are transpoed back to the liver in the poal vein and excreted in the bile (enterohepatic circulation).REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:438,439,440",

Collectively, these neurons constitute the enteric nervous system. The system contains about 100 million sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons in humans--as many as are found in the whole spinal cord and the system is probably best viewed as a displaced pa of the central nervous system (CNS) that is concerned with the regulation of gastrointestinal function. It is sometimes referred to as the \"little brain\" for this reason. It is connected to the CNS by parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers but can function autonomously without these connections. The myenteric plexus innervates the longitudinal and circular smooth muscle layers and is concerned primarily with motor control, whereas the submucous plexus innervates the glandular epithelium, intestinal endocrine cells, and submucosal blood vessels and is primarily involved in the control of intestinal secretion. The neurotransmitters in the system include acetylcholine, the amines norepinephrine and serotonin, the amino acid g-aminobutyrate (GABA), the purine adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the gases NO and CO, and many different peptides and polypeptides. Some of these peptides also act in a paracrine fashion, and some enter the bloodstream, becoming hormones.

When bile is excluded from the intestine, up to 50% of ingested fat appears in the feces. A severe malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins also results. When bile salt reabsorption is prevented by resection of the terminal ileum or by disease in this poion of the small intestine, the amount of fat in the stools is also increased because when the enterohepatic circulation is interrupted, the liver cannot increase the rate of bile salt production to a sufficient degree to compensate for the loss.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:438,439,440",

        "exp": "Methyl-B12 is absorbed by two processes. The first is an intestinal mechanism using intrinsic factor through which 1-2 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a diffusion process by which approximately 1% of the remainder is absorbed. The human physiology of vitamin B12 is complex, and therefore is prone to mishaps leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. Protein-bound vitamin B12 must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. Gastric acid releases the vitamin from food paicles; therefore antacid and acid-blocking medications (especially proton-pump inhibitors) may inhibit absorption of B12. B12 taken in a low-solubility, non-chewable supplement pill form may bypass the mouth and stomach and not mix with gastric acids, but acids are not necessary for the absorption of free B12 not bound to protein; acid is necessary only to recover naturally-occurring vitamin B12 from foods. R-protein (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin) is a B12 binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands. It must wait to bind food-B12 until B12 has been freed from proteins in food by pepsin in the stomach. B12 then binds to the R-protein to avoid degradation of it in the acidic environment of the stomach. This pattern of B12 transfer to a special binding protein secreted in a previous digestive step, is repeated once more before absorption. The next binding protein for B12 is intrinsic factor (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric parietal cells that is secreted in response to histamine, gastrin and pentagastrin, as well as the presence of food. In the duodenum, proteases digest R-proteins and release their bound B12, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B12). B12 must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal ileum of the small bowel only recognize the B12-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from catabolism by intestinal bacteria. Once the IF/B12 complex is recognized by specialized ileal receptors, it is transpoed into the poal circulation. The vitamin is then transferred to transcobalamin II (TC-II/B12), which serves as the plasma transpoer. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B12 and infantile megaloblastic anemia, and abnormal B12 related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B12 levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B12 complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be endocytosed. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a lysosome, and free B12 is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by ceain cellular enzymes.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 458",

        "exp": "Substances are said to undergo an enterohepatic circulation (EHC) when they are excreted into the bile, pass into the lumen of the intestine, are reabsorbed and then return to the liver the circulation. Many endogenous and exogenous substances can undergo an EHC. Among the endogenous substances are the bile salts, the biliary lipids and biliary phospholipids, bilirubin, estrone and estriol, folic acid, vitamin B12, and urobilinogen. In contrast to bile salts, which undergo a highly efficient enterohepatic circulation, glucuronic acid conjugates of bilirubin are biliary excretory molecules that in health do not have a continuing biologic life. Intestinal absorptive cells are devoid of recapture transpoers for bilirubin conjugates, and their large size and polarity prevent absorption by passive diffusion. However, unconjugated bilirubin can be absorbed passively from any pa of the small and large intestines. This can occur only if unconjugated bilirubin is kept in solution and does not undergo rapid bacterial reduction to form urobilinoids. Biliverdin results from the breakdown of the heme moiety of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin, which normally rapidly reduces to free bilirubin. Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), a derivative of hippuric acid, is a diagnostic agent useful in medical tests involving the kidney used in the measurement of renal plasma flow. It filters freely through the glomerular membranes. Urobilinogen is a colourless by-product of bilirubin reduction. It is formed in the intestines by bacterial action on bilirubin. About half of the urobilinogen formed is reabsorbed and taken up the poal vein to the liver, enters circulation and is excreted by the kidney.

They are of little quantitative significance for lipid digestion other than in the setting of pancreatic insufficiency, however. Most fat digestion, therefore, begins in the duodenum, pancreatic lipase being one of the most impoant enzymes involved. This enzyme hydrolyzes the 1- and 3-bonds of the triglycerides(triacylglycerols) with relative ease but acts on the 2- bonds at a very low rate, so the principal products of its action are free fatty acids and 2-monoglycerides (2-monoacylglycerols). It acts on fats that have been emulsified. Its activity is facilitated when an amphipathic helix that covers the active site like a lid is bent back. Colipase, a protein with a molecular weight of about 11,000, is also secreted in the pancreatic juice, and when this molecule binds to the -COOH terminaldomain of the pancreatic lipase, opening of the lid is facilitated. Colipase is secreted in an inactive proform and is activated in the intestinal lumen by trypsin. Another pancreatic lipase that is activated by bile salts has been characterized. This 100,000kDa cholesterol esterase represents about 4% of the total protein in pancreatic juice In adults, pancreatic lipase is 10-60 times more active, but unlike pancreatic lipase, this bile salt-activated lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters, esters of fat-soluble vitamins, and phospholipids, as well as triglycerides. A very similar enzyme is found in human milk. Fats are relatively insoluble, which limits their ability to cross the unstirred layer and reach the surface of the mucosal cells. However, they are finely emulsified in the small intestine by the detergent action of bile salts, lecithin, and monoglycerides.When the concentration of bile salts in the intestine is high, as it is after contraction of the gallbladder, lipids and bile salts interact spontaneously to form micelles. Micellar formation fuher solubilizes the lipids and provides a mechanism for their transpo to the enterocytes. Thus, the micelles move down their concentration gradient through the unstirred layer to the brush border of the mucosal cells. The lipids diffuse out of the micelles, and a saturated aqueous solution of the lipids is maintained in contact with the brush border of the mucosal cellsREF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:457",

        "exp": "The gastric secretions arise from glands in the wall of the stomach that drain into its lumen, and also from the surface cells that secrete primarily mucus and bicarbonate to protect the stomach from digesting itself, as well as substances known as trefoil peptides that stabilize the mucus-bicarbonate layer The acid secreted by parietal cells serves to sterilize the meal and also to begin the hydrolysis of dietary macromolecules. Intrinsic factor is impoant for the later absorption of vitamin B12, or cobalamin (Figure 26-6). Pepsinogen is the precursor of pepsin, which initiates protein digestion. Lipase similarly begins the digestion of dietary fats. There are three primary stimuli of gastric secretion, each with a specific role to play in matching the rate of secretion to functional requirements. Gastrin is a hormone that is released by G cells in the antrum of the stomach both in response to a specific neurotransmitter released from enteric nerve endings, known as gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP, or bombesin) and also in response to the presence of oligopeptides in the gastric lumen. Gastrin is then carried through the bloodstream to the fundic glands, where it binds to receptors not only on parietal (and likely, chief cells) to activate secretion but also on so-called enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL cells) that are located in the gland and release histamine. Histamine is also a trigger of parietal cell secretion, binding to H2 histamine receptors. Finally, parietal and chief cells can also be stimulated by acetylcholine, released from enteric nerve endings in the fundus. The three agonists of the parietal cell--gastrin, histamine, and acetylcholine--each bind to distinct receptors on the basolateral membrane. Gastrin and acetylcholine promote secretion by elevating cytosolic free calcium concentrations, whereas histamine increases intracellular cyclic adenosine 3&;,5&;-monophosphate (cAMP).Stimuli that affect gastrin secretion.Stimuli that increase gastrin secretionLuminal Peptides and amino acids Distention 2 .Neural Increased vagal discharge GRP 3 Bloodborne Calcium EpinephrineStimuli that inhibit gastrin secretion 1.

        "question": "Highest concentration of potassium is seen in",
        "exp": "K+ channels are present in the luminal as well as the basolateral membrane of the enterocytes of the colon, so K+ is secreted into the colon. In addition, K+ moves passively down its electrochemical gradient. The accumulation of K+ in the colon is paially offset by H+-K+ ATPase in the luminal membrane of cells in the distal colon, with resulting active transpo of K+ into the cells. Neveheless, loss of ileal or colonic fluids in chronic diarrhea can lead to severe hypokalemia. When the dietary intake of K+ is high for a prolonged period, aldosterone secretion is increased and more K+ enters the colon. This is due in pa to the appearance of more Na+- K+ ATPase pumps in the basolateral membranes of the cells, with a consequent increase in intracellular K+ and K+ diffusion across the luminal membranes of the cells. The intestines are presented each day with about 2000 mL of ingested fluid plus 7000 mL of secretions from the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and associated glands. Ninety-eight percent of this fluid is reabsorbed, with a daily fluid loss of only 200 mL in the stools. In the small intestine, secondary active transpo of Na+ is impoant in bringing about absorption of glucose, some amino acids, and other substances such as bile acids (see above). Conversely, the presence of glucose in the intestinal lumen facilitates the reabsorption of Na+. In the period between meals, when nutrients are not present, sodium and chloride are absorbed together from the lumen by the coupled activity of a sodium/hydrogen exchanger (NHE) and chloride/bicarbonate exchanger in the apical membrane, in a so-called electroneutral mechanism. Water then follows to maintain an osmotic balance. In the colon, moreover, an additional electrogenic mechanism for sodium absorption is expressed, paicularly in the distal colon. In this mechanism, sodium enters across the apical membrane an ENaC (epithelial sodium) channel that is identical to that expressed in the distal tubule of the kidney. This underpins the ability of the colon to desiccate the stool and ensure that only a small poion of the fluid load used daily in the digestion and absorption of meals is lost from the body. Following a low-salt diet, increased expression of ENaC in response to aldosterone increases the ability to reclaim sodium from the stool. The pancreatic juice is alkaline and has a high HCO3 content (approximately 113 mEq/L vs. 24 mEq/L in plasma). About 1500 mL of pancreatic juice is secreted per day. Bile and intestinal juices are also neutral or alkaline, and these three secretions neutralize the gastric acid, raising the pH of the duodenal contents to 6.0 to 7.0. By the time the chyme reaches the jejunum, its pH is nearly neutral, but the intestinal contents are rarely alkaline. Bile is made up of the bile acids, bile pigments, and other substances dissolved in an alkaline electrolyte solution that resembles pancreatic juice.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:435,438,441,442",

When the meal is present, the enteric nervous system promotes a motility pattern that is related to peristalsis but is designed to retard the movement of the intestinal contents along the length of the intestinal tract to provide time for digestion and absorption. Except in the esophagus and the proximal poion of the stomach, the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract has spontaneous rhythmic fluctuations in membrane potential between about -65 and -45 mV. This basic electrical rhythm (BER) is initiated by the interstitial cells of Cajal, stellate mesenchymal pacemaker cells with smooth muscle-like features that send long multiply branched processes into the intestinal smooth muscle. In the stomach and the small intestine, these cells are located in the outer circular muscle layer near the myenteric plexus; in the colon, they are at the submucosal border of the circular muscle layer. In the stomach and small intestine, there is a descending gradient in pacemaker frequency, and as in the hea, the pacemaker with the highest frequency usually dominates.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:469,470",

The stretch initiates a circular contraction behind the stimulus and an area of relaxation in front of it. The wave of contraction then moves in an oral-to-caudal direction, propelling the contents of the lumen forward at rates that vary from 2 to 25 cm/s. Peristaltic activity can be increased or decreased by the autonomic input to the gut, but its occurrence is independent of the extrinsic innervation. Indeed, progression of the contents is not blocked by removal and resuture ofa segment of intestine in its original position and is blocked only if the segment is reversed before it is sewn back into place. Peristalsis is an excellent example of the integrated activity of the enteric nervous system. It appears that local stretch releases serotonin, which activates sensory neurons that activate the myenteric plexus. Cholinergic neurons passing in a retrograde direction in this plexus activate neurons that release substance P and acetylcholine, causing smooth muscle contraction. At the same time, cholinergic neurons passing in an anterograde direction activate neurons that secrete NO, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), producing the relaxation ahead of the stimulus.</P>REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:469,470",

        "question": "Gastric phase of gastric acid secretion is influenced by",
        "exp": "The gastric secretions arise from glands in the wall of the stomach that drain into its lumen, and also from the surface cells that secrete primarily mucus and bicarbonate to protect the stomach from digesting itself, as well as substances known as trefoil peptides that stabilize the mucus-bicarbonate layer. The glandular secretions of the stomach differ in different regions of the organ. The most characteristic secretions derive from the glands in the fundus or body of the stomach. There are three primary stimuli of gastric secretion, each with a specific role to play in matching the rate of secretion to functional requirements. Gastrin is a hormonethat is released by G cells in the antrum of the stomach both in response to a specific neurotransmitter released from enteric nerve endings, known as gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP, or bombesin) and also in response to the presence of oligopeptides in the gastric lumen. Gastrin is then carried through the bloodstream to the fundic glands, where it binds to receptors not only on parietal (and likely, chief cells) to activate secretion but also on so-called enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL cells) that are located in the gland and release histamine. Histamine is also a trigger of parietal cell secretion, binding to H2 histamine receptors. Finally, parietal and chief cells can also be stimulated by acetylcholine, released from enteric nerve endings in the fundus. During the cephalic phase of gastric secretion, secretion ispredominantly activated by vagal input that originates from the brain region known as the dorsal vagal complex, which coordinates input from higher centers. Vagal outflow to the stomach then releases GRP and acetylcholine, thereby initiating secretory function. However, before the meal enters the stomach, there are few additional triggers and thus the amount of secretion is limited. Once the meal is swallowed, on the other hand, meal constituents trigger substantial release of gastrin and the physical presence of the meal also distends the stomach and activates stretch receptors, which provoke a \"vago-vagal\" as well as local reflexes that fuher amplify secretion. The presence of the meal also buffers gastric acidity that would otherwise serve as a feedback inhibitory signal to shut off secretion secondary to the release of somatostatin, which inhibits both G and ECL cells as well as secretion by parietal cells themselves. This probably represents a key mechanism whereby gastric secretion.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMAN, HEDDWEN BROOKSTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO: 432,433",

The sugar molecules pass from the mucosal cells to the blood in the capillaries draining into the poal vein. The transpo of most hexoses is dependent on Na+ in the intestinal lumen; a high concentration of Na+ in the mucosal surface of the cells facilitates and a low concentration inhibits sugar influx into the epithelial cells. This is because glucose and Na+share the same cotranspoer,or sympo,the sodium-dependent glucose transpoer (SGLT, Na+glucose cotranspoer) The members of this family of transpoers, SGLT 1 and SGLT 2, resemble the glucose transpoers responsible for facilitated diffusion.in that they cross the cell membrane 12 times and have their -COOH and -NH2 terminals on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. However, there is no homology to the glucose transpoer (GLUT) series of transpoers. SGLT-1 is responsible for uptake of dietary glucose from the gut. The related transpoer, SGLT 2, is responsible for glucose transpo out of the renal tubules. Because the intracellular Na+concentration is low in intestinal cells as it is in other cells, Na+moves into the cell along its concentration gradient. Glucose moves with the Na+ and is released in the cell. The Na+is transpoed into the lateral intercellular spaces, and the glucose is transpoed by GLUT 2 into the interstitium and thence to the capillaries. Thus, glucose transpo is an example of secondary active transpo, the energy for glucose transpo is provided indirectly, by the active transpo of Na+ out of the cell. This maintains the concentration gradient across the luminal border of the cell so that more Na+and consequently more glucose enter. When the Na+glucose cotranspoer is congenitally defective, the resulting glucose/galactose malabsorption causes severe diarrhea that is often fatal if glucose and galactose are not promptly removed from the diet.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:453",

Subsequently, there is a gastric phase of secretion that is quantitatively the most significant, and finally an intestinal phase once the meal has left the stomach. Each phase is closely regulated by both local and distant triggers. The gastric secretions arise from glands in the wall of the stomach that drain into its lumen, and also from the surface cells that secrete primarily mucus and bicarbonate to protect the stomach from digesting itself, as well as substances known as trefoil peptides that stabilize the mucus-bicarbonate layer. The glandular secretions of the stomach differ in different regions of the organ. The most characteristic secretions derive from the glands in the fundus or body of the stomach. These contain two distinctive cell types from which the gastric secretions arise: the parietal cells, which secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor; and the chief cells, which produce pepsinogens and gastric lipase.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:432",

The glandular secretions of the stomach differ in different regions of the organ. The most characteristic secretions derive from the glands in the fundus or body of the stomach. These contain two distinctive cell types from which the gastric secretions arise: the parietal cells, which secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor; and the chiefcells, which produce pepsinogens and gastric lipase. The acid secreted by parietal cells serves to sterilize the meal and also to begin the hydrolysis of dietary macromolecules. Intrinsic factor is impoant for the later absorption of vitamin B12 or cobalamin. Pepsinogen is the precursor of pepsin, which initiates protein digestion. Lipase similarly begins the digestion of dietary fats.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:432",

        "exp": "Most of the bilirubin in the body is formed in the tissues by the break down of hemoglobin. The bilirubin is bound to albumin in the circulation. Some of it is tightly bound, but most of it can dissociate in the liver, and free bilirubin enters liver cells a member of the organic anion transpoing polypeptide (OATP) family and then becomes bound to cytoplasmic proteins. It is next conjugated to glucuronic acid in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme glucuronyl transferase (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase). This enzyme is located primarily in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Each bilirubin molecule reacts with two uridines diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPG) molecules to form bilirubin diglucuronide. This glucuronide, which is more water-soluble than the free bilirubin, is then transpoed against a concentration gradient most likely by an active transpoer known as multidrug resistance protein-2 (MRP-2) into the bile canaliculi. A small amount of the bilirubin glucuronide escapes into the blood, where it is boundless tightly to albumin than is free bilirubin and is excreted in the urine. Thus, the total plasma bilirubin normally includes free bilirubin plus a small amount of conjugated bilirubin. Most of the bilirubin glucuronide passes the bile ducts to the intestine.Reference: Ganong review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 483",

The unidirectional fluxes of Na across the intestinal mucosa were also investigated using 22Na. Net Na and water absorption in the mid-jejunum were about two-fold higher than in the proximal and distal jejunum and the colon descendens. With the exception of the proximal jejunum, Na and Cl absorption did not differ significantly. The unidirectional Na fluxes in both directions were much higher in the proximal and mid-jejunum than in the distal jejunum and colon descendens. K was also absorbed most efficiently from the mid-jejunum. In the colon descendens mean net K absorption was about zero. Ca absorption in the upper and mid-jejunum exceeded that of the distal jejunum and colon descendens, where the values were close to zero. The results show that in the whole jejunum of young milk-fed lambs net absorptive fluxes of Na, Cl, K, Ca and water occur, whereas the colon descendens appears to play a role only in Na, Cl and water absorption.

Therefore, the bile salts tend to form cylindrical disks called micelles. Their hydrophilic poions face out and their hydrophobic poions face in. Above a ceain concentration, called the critical micelle concentration, all bile salts added to a solution form micelles. Lipids collect in the micelles, with cholesterol in the hydrophobic center and amphipathic phospholipids and monoglycerides lined up with their hydrophilic heads on the outside and their hydrophobic tails in the center.

Collectively, these neurons constitute the enteric nervous system. The system contains about 100 million sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons in humans--as many as are found in the whole spinal cord--and the system is probably best viewed as a displaced pa of the central nervous system (CNS) that is concerned with the regulation of gastrointestinal function. It is sometimes referred to as the \"little brain\" for this reason. It is connected to the CNS by parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers but can function autonomously without these connections. The myenteric plexus innervates the longitudinal and circular smooth muscle layers and is concerned primarily with motor control, whereas the submucous plexus innervates the glandular epithelium, intestinal endocrine cells, and submucosal blood vessels and is primarily involved inthe control of intestinal secretion. The neurotransmitters in the system include acetylcholine, the amines norepinephrine and serotonin, the amino acid g-aminobutyrate (GABA), the purine adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the gases NO and CO, and many different peptides and polypeptides. Some of these peptides also act in a paracrine fashion, and some enter the bloodstream, becoming hormones. Not surprisingly, most of them are also found in the brain.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, SCOTT BOITANO, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:448",

        "exp": "Hexoses are rapidly absorbed across the wall of the small intestine. Essentially all the hexoses are removed before the remains of a meal reach the terminal pa of the ileum. The sugar molecules pass from the mucosal cells to the blood in the capillaries draining into the poal vein. The transpo of most hexoses is dependent on Na+ in the intestinal lumen; a high concentration of Na+ on the mucosal surface of the cells facilitates and a low concentration inhibits sugar influx into the epithelial cells. This is because glucose and Na+share the same cotranspoer, or sympo, the sodium-dependent glucose transpoer (SGLT, Na+glucose cotranspoer). The members of this family of transpoers, SGLT 1 and SGLT 2, resemble the glucose transpoers responsible for facilitated diffusion in that they cross the cell membrane 12 times and have their -COOH and -NH2 terminals on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. However, there is no homology to the glucose transpoer (GLUT) series of transpoers. SGLT-1 is responsible for uptake of dietary glucose from the gut. The related transpoer, SGLT 2, is responsible for glucose transpo out of the renal tubules. Because the intracellular Na+ concentration is low in intestinal cells as it is in other cells, Na+ moves into the cell along its concentration gradient. Glucose moves with the Na+ and is released in the cell. The Na+ is transpoed into the lateral intercellular spaces, and the glucose is transpoed by GLUT 2 into the interstitium and thence to the capillaries. Thus, glucose transpo is an example of secondary active transpo (see Chapter; the energy for glucose transpo is provided indirectly, by the active transpo of Na+out of the cell. This maintains the concentration gradient across the luminal border of the cell so that more Na+and consequently more glucose enter. When the Na+/glucose cotranspoer is congenitally defective, the resulting glucose/galactose malabsorption causes severe diarrhea that is often fatal if glucose and galactose are not promptly removed from the diet. SGLT-1 also transpos galactose, but fructose utilizes a different mechanism. Its absorption is independent of Na+ or the transpo of glucose and galactose; it is transpoed instead by facilitated diffusion from the intestinal lumen into the enterocytes by GLUT 5 and out of the enterocytes into the interstitium by GLUT 2. Some fructose is conveed to glucose in the mucosal cells. Insulin has little effect on intestinal transpo of sugars. In this respect, intestinal absorption resembles glucose reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidneys; neither process requires phosphorylation, and both are essentially normal in diabetes but are depressed by the drug phlorizin. The maximal rate of glucose absorption from the intestine is about 120 g/h.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:453,454",

        "exp": "Peristalsis is a reflex response that is initiated when the gut wall is stretched by the contents of the lumen, and it occurs in all pas of the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum. The stretch initiates a circular contraction behind the stimulus and an area of relaxation in front of it. The wave of contraction then moves in an oral-to-caudal direction, propelling the contents of the lumen forward at rates that vary from 2 to 25 cm/s. Peristaltic activity can be increased or decreased by the autonomic input to the gut, but its occurrence is independent of the extrinsic innervation. Indeed, progression of the contents is not blocked by removal and resuture of a segment of intestine in its original position and is blocked only if the segment is reversed before it is sewn back into place. Peristalsis is an excellent example of the integrated activity of the enteric nervous system. It appears that local stretch releases serotonin, which activates sensory neurons that activate the myenteric plexus. Cholinergic neurons passing in a retrograde direction in this plexus activate neurons that release substance P and acetylcholine, causing smooth muscle contraction. At the same time, cholinergic neurons passing in an anterograde direction activate neurons that secrete NO, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), producing the relaxation ahead of the stimulus.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMAN, TWENTY-THIRD EDITION, PAGE NO:469,470",

        "question": "Gastric emptying is delayed by all except",
        "exp": "The rate at which the stomach empties into the duodenum depends on the type of food ingested. Food rich in carbohydrate leaves the stomach in a few hours. Protein-rich food leaves more slowly, and emptying is slowest after a meal containing fat. The rate of emptying also depends on the osmotic pressure of the material entering the duodenum. Hyperosmolality of the duodenal contents is sensed by \"duodenal osmoreceptors\" that initiate a decrease in gastric emptying which is probably neural in origin. Fats, carbohydrates, and acid in the duodenum inhibit gastric acid and pepsin secretion and gastric motility neural and hormonal mechanisms. The hormone involved is probably peptide YY. CCK has also been implicated as an inhibitor of gastric emptying. In the regulation of gastric emptying, the antrum, pylorus, and upper duodenum apparently function as a unit. Contraction of the antrum is followed by sequential contraction of the pyloric region and the duodenum. In the antrum, paial contraction ahead of the advancing gastric contents prevents solid masses from entering the duodenum, and they are mixed and crushed instead. The more liquid gastric contents are squied a bit at a time into the small intestine. Secretin increases the secretion of bicarbonate by the duct cells of the pancreas and biliary tract. It thus causes the secretion of a watery, alkaline pancreatic juice. Its action on pancreatic duct cells is mediated cAMP. It also augments the action of CCK in producing pancreatic secretion of digestive enzymes. It decreases gastric acid secretion and may cause contraction of the pyloric sphincter. Acid in the antrum inhibits gastrin secretion, paly by a direct action on G cells and paly by release of somatostatin, a relatively potent inhibitor of gastrin secretion. The effect of acid is the basis of a negative feedback loop regulating gastrin secretion. Increased secretion of the hormone increases acid secretion, but the acid then feeds back to inhibit fuher gastrin secretion.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:443,446,473",

This basic electrical rhythm (BER) is initiated by the interstitial cells of Cajal, stellate mesenchymal pacemaker cells with smooth muscle-like features that send long multiply branched processes into the intestinal smooth muscle. In the stomach and the small intestine, these cells are located in the outer circular muscle layer near the myenteric plexus; in the colon, they are at the submucosal border of the circular muscle layer. In the stomach and small intestine, there is a descending gradient in pacemaker frequency, and as in the hea, the pacemaker with the highest frequency usually dominates. The BER itself rarely causes muscle contraction, but spike potentials superimposed on the most depolarizing poions of the BER waves do increase muscle tension. The depolarizing poion of each spike is due to Ca2+ influx, and the repolarizing poion is due to K+efflux. Many polypeptides and neurotransmitters affect the BER. For example, acetylcholine increases the number of spikes and the tension of the smooth muscle, whereas epinephrine decreases the number of spikes and the tension. The rate of the BER is about 4/min in the stomach. It is about 12/min in the duodenum and falls to about 8/min in the distal ileum. In the colon, the BER rate rises from about 2/min at the cecum to about 6/min at the sigmoid. The function of the BER is to coordinate peristaltic and other motor activity; contractions occur only during the depolarizing pa of the waves. After vagotomy or transection of the stomach wall, for example, peristalsis in the stomach becomes irregular and chaotic.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGYKIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMAN, TWENTY-THIRD EDITION PAGE NO:470",

Enterokinase is secreted into the lumen by mucosa cells, but much of it adheres to the enterocyte membrane. Once activated, trypsin can fuher activate itself as well as other inactive proteases. Amylase is secreted in active form and does not depend on enterokinase to be effective.Amylase is found in saliva and pancreatic juice.Starch is ingested in two forms, amylose and amylopectin. Amylase hydrolyzes amylose to maltose or maltotriose. Amylopectin contains -1,6 branch points, which cannot be digested by amylase. In this case, a limit dextrins are produced; they are polysaccharide fragments of variable size, each containing an -1,6 linkage. The brush-border enzyme -dextrinase completes the digestion of a-limit dextrins to single glucose units.Sucrase is a brush-border enzyme that hydrolyzes sucrose to glucose and fructose. These monosaccharides are subsequently absorbed by the enterocyte.The absorption of glucose and galactose is secondary active transpo. The absorption is sodium dependent. A carrier molecule in the mucosal membrane binds two sodium molecules for every glucose or galactose molecule; these two monosaccharides share the same transpo protein. Basolateral membrane sodium-potassium ATPase pumps keep the enterocyte intracellular concentration of sodium low. This situation provides a concentration gradient that ors the movement of sodium from the lumen into the enterocyte.
