A protein that binds O2 with high affinity would bind it efficiency in the lungs but would not release much of it in the tissues. If the protein oxygen with a sufficiently low affinity to release it easily in the tissues, it would not pick up much of oxygen in lungs.Haemoglobin solves this problem by undergoing a transition from a low affinity state (the *T state) to a high affinity state (the (R state) as more oxygen molecules are bound.

A rise in temperature or fall in pH shift the curve to right. 2,3-BPG is very plentiful in red cell. It is formed from 3-phosphoglycoraldehyde (3-PGA], which is a product of glycolysis via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. Because acidosis inhibit glycolysis., 2,3-BPG concentration falls when pH is low. Thyroid hormone, Growth hormone, & androgen increase the concentration of 2, 3-BPG & the P50 The affinity of foetal Hb (HbF) for O2, which is greater than that of adult Hb (HbA), shifts the curve to left,Excercise has been reported to produce an increase in 2,3- BPG within 60 minutes .although the rise may not occur in trained athletes. The P50 is also increased during excercise. Ascend to high'4 altitude trigger a substantial rise in 2,3-BPG concentration. The rise in 2, 3-BPG, which has a half-like of 6 hours, is secondary to the rise in blood pH. 2,3-BPG level drops to normal on return to sea level.\"Certain Hb like sickle cell anaemia shift the O2 dissociation cu rve to right\"- Kumar & Clark 4th/357 & 6th/430\"HbM O2 affinity is much lower than normal HbA while O2. affinity of Hb Chesapeake & Rainier is more \"- Chatterjea & Shinde 7th/ 149\"Because Mb-O2 dissociation curve lies left5 of Hb-O2 dissociation curve, it takes up O2 from Hb in the blood\"- Ganong 22nd/669",

        "question": "Oxygen comes from alveoli to blood by -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Diffusiono Oxygen is transferred from the alveoli to the pulmonary' capillaries by the process of diffusion. The diffusion occurs across the respiratory membrane.o As oxygen diffuses into the blood, it combines with hemoglobin. However, the oxygen, in combination with hemoglobin, does not contribute to the PO2 of blood. Therefore the alveolar - capillary gradient of PO2 is maintained much longer than it would be if hemoglobin were not present. The sequence mey be visualized as follows: -Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the plasma due to the PO2 gradient.To start with, the PO2 in the RBC fluids is the same as in the plasma. As soon as diffusion from the alveoli to plasma raises the PO2 of plasma above that of the RBC fluids, oxygen diffuses from the plasma into the RBC.As soon as oxygen enters the RBC, it combines with hemoglobin, which mops up oxygen but does not let PO2 rise. The process continues till hemoglobin cannot pick up any more oxygen.Then the PO2 in the RBC fluids rises to equal that in the plasma and diffusion from the plasma to RBC stops.After that the PO2 in the plasma also rises to equal that in the alveoli, and consequently diffusion from the alveoli to the plasma stops.o Thus, the presence of hemoglobin makes an enormous difference to the amount of oxygen transferred. By mopping up oxygen without letting the PO2 rise, it lets the diffusion of oxygen continue much longer. While the PO2 gradient determines the direction of diffusion of oxygen, it is actually hemoglobin that lays the trap for carrying large amounts of oxygen in the blood.",
