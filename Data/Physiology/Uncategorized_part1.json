The RV, the FRC, and the TLC, however, cannot be determined with a spirometer because the subject cannot exhale all the gas in the lungs. The lung volumes not measurable with spirometry can be determined by the nitrogen-washout technique, by the helium-dilution technique, and by body plethysmography. The FRC is usually determined, and RV (which is equal to FRC minus ERV) and the TLC (which is equal to VC plus RV) are then calculated from volumes obtained by spirometry. Ref: Levitzky M.G. (2007).

However, the use of these tools to cardiac imaging is severely limited because of motion aifacts produced by constantly in motion hea completing an entire cycle of contraction and relaxation in about 1 second.- So radiological cardiac imaging requires a 'window' of minimum cardiac motion to reduce motion aifacts and achieve meaningful images.

        "exp": "The plasma colloid osmotic pressure is often low in alcoholics with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). The diseased liver cannot produce adequate amounts of albumin, which leads to a decrease in the concentration of albumin in the plasma, i.e., hypoalbuminemia. Because about 75% of the plasma colloid osmotic pressure can be attributed to the presence of albumin in the plasma, the decrease in plasma albumin concentration that occurs in the latter stages of cirrhosis often leads to peripheral edema. Cirrhosis also causes excess fluid to accumulate in the peritoneal cavity as ascites. In the case of ascites, the edema results not only from hypoalbuminemia, but also from poal vein obstruction (which increases capillary hydrostatic pressure) as well as the obstruction of lymphatic drainage of the liver. In fact, ascites is observed more often than peripheral edema in liver disease. A decrease in capillary hydrostatic pressure would tend to decrease fluid loss from the capillaries, and thereby oppose the development of edema. A decrease in the colloid osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid would decrease fluid loss from the capillaries, thereby opposing the development of edema. A decrease in interstitial hydrostatic pressure would tend to increase fluid loss from the capillaries, but this cannot be considered a primary cause of edema because the interstitial hydrostatic pressure actually increases when a tissue becomes edematous.

These bodies are located in the connective tissue associated with the vessel wall, at the bifurcation of the common carotid, and on the arch of aoa, respectively. The characteristic cells of both these structures are called glomus cells. Type I glomus cells have a high dopamine content, which they possibly employ as a neurotransmetter. Peripheral chemoreceptors convey information to the DRG of neurons in medulla, for which purpose the afferent neurons from the carotid bodies pass through glossopharyngeal nerve and from the aoic bodies pass through vagus nerve. The most potent natural stimulus for peripheral chemoreceptors is low aerial P02 (hypoxic hypoxia). The other stimuli which activate peripheral chemoreceptors are high aerial PCO2, and an increase in aerial hydrogen ion concentration (acidosis or low pH). The response to activation of peripheral chemoreceptors is an increase in pulmonary ventilation through an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. The blood flow to peripheral chemoreceptors, on per unit mass basis, is the highest to any tissue in the body. With a blood flow of 2000 ml/min/100 gm tissue, the carotid and aoic bodies, inspite of their high metabolic rate, hardly remove any oxygen from the blood supplies to them. That is why the aeriovenous oxygen difference is negligible in these bodies. Thus these structures are idealy built to sense change in aerial P02. It is good to keep in mind that stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors not only stimulates medullary respiratory centers but also medullary vasomotor center. Therefore, the response to their stimulation is tachycardia, vasoconstriction and increase BP along with hyperventilation.",

        "exp": "The kidney is innervated primarily by the sympathetic nervous system, and as such, regulates the contraction of the smooth muscle surrounding the afferent and efferent aerioles of the glomerulus. Sympathetic stimulation to the efferent glomerular aerioles causes their constriction and increases the filtration rate, leading to an increase in urinary output. Similarly, with the loss of sympathetic innervation, such as due to sympathectomy of the kidney, relaxation of tone of the afferent aeriole occurs and the filtration rate increases, which results in an increased urine output. Decreased urine output may result from the constriction of the afferent aerioles, leading to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. Also Know: Factors affecting the GFR: Changes in renal blood flow Changes in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure Changes in systemic blood pressure Afferent or efferent aeriolar constriction Changes in hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's capsule Ureteral obstruction Edema of kidney inside tight renal capsule Changes in concentration of plasma proteins: dehydration, hypoproteinemia, etc (minor factors) Changes in Kf Changes in glomerular capillary permeability Changes in effective filtration surface area Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L.

        "exp": "Response to Co2, PaCO2 is most impoant factor in control of ventilation under normal conditions. PCo2 is most impoant input regulating magnitude of ventilation under resting conditions. Changes in alveolar ventilation have immediate, pronounced effect on aerial Pco2 (unlike Po2). Even slight alterations from normal Pco2 induce significant reflex. Increased Pco2 increases ventilation. Blood Brain Barrier is permeable to Co2, so increased aerial Pco2 increases brain ECF Pco2 and , it stimulates central chemoreceptors which increases ventilation by stimulating respiratory centers. Regulation of respiration: The rhythmic discharges from the brain that produce spontaneous respiration are regulated by alterations in aerial Po2, PCo2, and H+ concentration. There are numerous factors that affect and control ventilation. Chemical control Co2 ( CSF and brain interstitial fluid H+ concentration) o2 ( carotid and aoic bodies) H+ ( carotid and aoic bodies) Nonchemical control Vagal afferents from receptors in the airways and lungs Afferents from the pons, hypothalamus, and limbic system Afferents from proprioceptors Afferents from baroreceptors: aerial, atrial, ventricular, pulmonary Preipheral (Carotid & Aoic) Chemoreceptors: The carotid bodies are located at the bifurcation of common carotid aery. They send afferents in the carotid sinus nerve to the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) the aoic bodies are located between the arch of aoa and pulmonary aery afferents ascend in the recurrent laryngeal nerves to the vagus (X). Stimulation results from a decrease in carotid and aoic body tissue PO2. Central Chemoreceptors: situated near (beneath) the ventral surface of the medulla, near the origins of the vagi and glossopharyngeal nerves these are anatomically separate from the respiratory centres, and are bathed in brain ECF. This is impermeable to both H+ and HCO3 -, however CO2 diffuses readily and decreases pH of CSF within a few minutes, which subsequently increases ventilation.

Also Know: Surfactant has both lipid (90%) and protein (10%) component. About half of the lipids are dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and the remaining are phosphatidylglycerol, cholesterol and other lipids. Half of the proteins are apoproteins and other half is composed of proteins normally found in blood plasma. Function of surfactant: The surfactant greatly reduces the surface tension allowing easier expansion and collapse of alveoli during during respiration and the resulting changes in pressure. It also helps the alveoli to expand and shrink at the same rate thereby reducing the chance for isolated overexpansion and total collapse of alveolar sacs.

The inhibitory effect is exeed at both the pituitary and the hypothalamic levels. The inhibition is due primarily to an action on DNA, and maximal inhibition takes several hours to develop, although more rapid \"fast feedback\" also occurs. The ACTH-inhibiting activity of the various steroids parallels their glucocoicoid potency. A drop in resting coicoid levels stimulates ACTH secretion, and in chronic adrenal insufficiency the rate of ACTH synthesis and secretion is markedly increased.Thus, the rate of ACTH secretion is determined by two opposing forces: the sum of the neural and possibly other stimuli converging through the hypothalamus to increase ACTH secretion, and the magnitude of the braking action of glucocoicoids on ACTH secretion, which is propoionate to their level in the circulating blood",

The opponent-process theory states that the cone photoreceptors are linked together to form three opposing color pairs: blue/yellow, red/green, and black/white. The Young-Helmholtz theory postulates that the retina contains three types of cones, each with a different photopigment maximally sensitive to one of the primary colors (red, blue, and green). The sensation of any given color is determined by the relative frequency of impulses from each type of cone. Parvocellular ganglion cells receive color-specific signals from the three types of cones and relay them to the brain the optic nerve. Ref: Waxman S.G. (2010). Chapter 15. The Visual System. In S.G.

This is thought to trigger inhibitory interneurons in lamina II of the spinal cord, thereby paially blocking the transmission of pain impulses. These interneurons are considered to be \"gatekeepers\", that can, to some degree, isolate the peripherally generated signals from the brain. Allodynia is the term used for the perception of pain following a normally innocuous stimulation of a mechanoreceptor. Central pain, such as that caused by thalamic lesions, is pain that originates at the level of the brain rather than in the periphery. Referred pain is the perception of pain initiated in one body site (typically an internal organ) as being localized to another body site (frequently on the more superficial pas of the body). An example is that of diaphragmatic pain, which may be referred to the top of the shoulder. The phenomenon occurs because both internal organs and more superficial structures may arise from, and consequently be innervated by, the same dermatome.",

        "question": "Insulin causes ?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Induction of lipogenesis ACTIONS OF INSULIN Insulin affects the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Effects on carbohydrate metabolism The overall effect of insulin is to decrease blood glucose level. Insulin increases the utilization of glucose and decreases its production by its following actions : - i) Stimulation of oxidation of glucose by glycolysis especially in the liver and skeletal muscle. ii) Stimulation of glycogenesis i.e., insulin ours conversion of glucose into its storage form, glycogen. This action is seen in both liver and muscles. iii) Inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose by myocytes (skeletal muscle, cardiac muscles), adipocytes (adipose tissue) and hepatocytes. Tissues that do not depend on insulin for glucose uptake include brain, erythrocytes (RBC), the epithelial cells of kidney & intestine, Liver, and Cornea & lens of eye. The mechanism through which insulin increases glucose uptake is different in different tissues. In the muscle and adipose tissues, insulin increase facilitated diffusion by increasing glucose transpoer (GLUT4 ) on the cell membrane. In the liver, insulin stimulates glucose entry into hepatocytes indirectly by induction of glucokinase so that the glucose entering the liver cells is promptly conveed to glucose - 6 - phosphate (glucose trapping). This keeps the intracellular glucose concentration low and ours entry of glucose into the liver. Thus, though the liver do not depend on insulin for glucose uptake, insulin stimulates glucose entry into hepatocytes. That means glucose entery can occur in liver without the action of insulin, but this is facilitated by insulin. On the other hand, myocytes (skeletal and cardiac muslces) and adipocytes (adipose tissue) are dependent on insulin for glucose uptake. Increased uptake of glucose in the glucose has following effects :- i) T Glycolysis :- It is due to induction of key enzymes of glycolysis by insulin. These key enzymes are glucokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. ii) Increased glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) :- It is due to induction of glycogen synthase. iii) Decreased glycogen break-down (Glycogenolysis) : - It is due to inhibition of enzyme phosphorylase. iv) Decreased gluconeogenesis :- It is due to inhibition of enzymes Pyruvate carboxylase, PEP carboxykinase, fructose 1, 6-bisphosphatase, glucose - 6 - phosphates. Effects on lipid metabolism Insulin induces lipogenesis by inducing enzyme acetyl CoA carboxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. Triglyceride synthesis is increased by induction of lipoprotein lipase. Lipolysis (13-oxidation) is decreased due to inhibition of hormone sensitive lipase, so that the fat in the adipose tissue is not broken down. Thus free fatty acid and glycerol are decreased. Because of antilipolytic action insulin decreases ketogenesis. There are two impoant lipases : - i) Lipoprotein lipase : - It hydrolysis the triglycerides of chylomicrons and VLDL into free fatty acid and glycerol in the vessels of skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles and adipose tissue. There FFA is taken up by the cells of these tissue and is conveed back into the triglyceride and the FFA is stored as triglyceride. So, lipoprotein lipase is involved in the synthesis of triglyceride. Lipoprotein lipase is stimulated by insulin, therefore insulin stimulates triglyceride synthesis. ii) Hormone sensitive lipase : - It is involved in lipolysis and cause degradation of stored triglyceride of adipose tissue into FFA and glycerol. FFA comes out into the blood raising the FFA levels of blood. Insulin inhibits hormone sensitive lipase therefore decreases FFA levels of blood. Effects on protein metabolism Insulin stimulates synthesis of protein (anabolism) and inhibits protein breakdown (catabolism). Insulin increases the active transpo of many amino acids into the tissue. In addition insulin increases protein synthesis by increasing the rate of synthesis of mRNA.",

The initial reaction in the intrinsic system is conversion of inactive factor XII to active factor XII (XIIa). This activation, which is catalyzed by high-molecular-weight kininogen and kallikrein, can be brought about in vitro by exposing the blood to electronegatively charged wettable surfaces such as glass and collagen fibers. Activation in vivo occurs when blood is exposed to the collagen fibers underlying the endothelium in the blood vessels. Active factor XII then activates factor XI, and active factor XI activates factor IX. Activated factor IX forms a complex with active factor VIII, which is activated when it is separated from von Willebrand factor. The complex of IXa and VIIIa activate factor X.

Thus, angiotensin II, a major regulator of glomerular function, causes constriction of both afferent and efferent aerioles, as well as reducing Kf. The overall outcome for GFR depends on the relative magnitudes of these actions, which vary in different pathophysiological conditions.

        "exp": "Diastolic blood pressure is indicated by fouh Korotkoff sound According to American Hea Association- onset of phase I Korotkoff s sound corresponds to systolic pressure and the disappearance of sounds (phase V) corresponds to diastolic pressure . More points about measuring blood pressure The standard technique for blood pressure measurement is the auscultatory technique. It was described by Nicolay Korotkoff in 1905 Mercury sphygmomanometers are considered a gold standard for blood pressure measurement, but they are being supplanted by aneroid sphygmomanometers The Korotkoff sound method tends to give values for systolic pressure that are lower than the true intra-aerial pressure, and diastolic values that are higher. Before performing a blood pressure reading, the patient should be comfoably seated with the back and arm suppoed, the legs uncrossed, and the upper arm at the level of the right atrium. The technique used to wrap the cuff is also impoant in assuring accurate readings. Cuffs that are wrapped too loose will result in falsely elevated values. Cuffs should be applied snugly,allowing only enough room for one finger to be slipped between the cuff and the skin surface. Inflation and deflation rate: Inflation and deflation rate of the manometer may affect the blood pressure reading. Inflation rate too slow -- Diastolic pressure is too high Deflation rate too fast -- Systolic pressure too low The sphygmomanometer pressure should then be reduced at 2 to 3 min/second. When measuring blood pressure, the cuff should be inflated to 30 mm Hg above the point at which the radial pulse disappears. The sphygmomanometer pressure should then be reduced at 2 to 3 min/second. Two readings should be performed at least one minute apa. An auscultatory gap is the interval of pressure where Korotkoff sounds indicating true systolic pressure fade away and reappear at a lower pressure point during the manual measurement of blood pressure. The improper interpretation of this gap may lead to errors made in the falsely low recording of systolic blood pressure. This gap usually occurs at a high pressure and can be mistaken for the silence of a pressure greater than the SBP, Except that the pulse can still be palpated. This is why it is greatly recommended to both palpate and auscultate the SBP. Spuriously high blood pressure is noted in: 1.Small cuff 2.0besity 3.Thick calcified aeries eg.

        "question": "Maximum pressure in left ventricle is seen in which phase of cardiac cycle ?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Ventricular ejection During ventricular ejection phase, when the steeply rising left ventricular pressure exceeds the aoic pressure (120 mm Hg), it is able to push open the aoic valve and eject the blad into the aoa, making the onset of ventricular ejection. PHASE OF CARDIAC CYCLE A cardiac cycle refers to the interval between onset of one heabeat to the onset of the next hea beat. It has two main phases : Ventricular systole and ventricular diastole. Ventricular systole (or simply systole) The systolic phase is divided into : - i) Isovolumetric contraction : As the ventricular contraction stas, the intraventricular pressure begins to rise, leading to an abrupt closure of AV valves (mitral and tricuspid valves). The closure of AV valves produces first hea sound (S1). the pressure is not enough to push open the semilunar valves (aoic and pulmonary) but causes the closed AV valve to bulge into the atrium, causing a small but sharp rise in atrial pressure called the 'C' wave on jugular venous pulse (JVP). Because both the valves (AV valves an semilunar valves) are closed, there is no change in volume, i.e., there is isovolumetric (isometric) contraction. Isovolumetric contraction ends with opening of semilunar (aoic and pulmonary) valves. ii) Ventricular ejection : When the steeply rising ventricular pressure exceeds the pressure in aoa and pulmonary aery, the semilunar valves open and ventricular ejection begins. The ejection of blood is rapid at first (rapid ejection phase), but slows down during later pa of systole (slow ejection phase). During rapid ejection phase, when the ventricles contract, the fibrous paition separating the ventricles from the atria (the AV ring) is pulled down. As a result, the atrial muscles get stretched and the atria dilate which causes a sharp fall in atrial pressure and the X-descent in JVP. iii) Protodiastole : In this very sho phase, ventricles sta relaxing and ventricular pressure begins to fall very sharply but the semilunar valves are still open. As a result, the column of blood in aoa (or pulmonary aery for right ventricle) tries to fall into the ventricle, hitting on its way the semilunar (aoic or pulmonary) valves. This causes closure of the aoic/pulmonary valves which produces 2\" hea sound (S2). The venous blood flow continues to flow in the atria from great veins (SVC and ICC) and there is relaxation of fibrous AV ring due to ventricular relaxation; both of which cause a rise in atrial pressure and production of `V' wave in JVP. Ventricular diastole (or simply diastole) The diastole phase is divided into : - i) Isovolumetric relaxation : - This phase is the period between the closure of semilunar valve and opening of the AV valve. The ventricles continue relaxing and there pressure continues to fall. However, as both valves (AV valves and semilunar valves) are closed, there is no change in volume, i.e., isovolumetric relaxation. Relaxation phase ends with opening of AV valve. ii) Rapid ventricular filling : - When the ventricular pressure falls below atrial pressure, AV valves open and the accumulated blood in the atria rushes into the ventricle very rapidly. This passive filling contributes to 70% of ventricular filling, normally. This results in a sharp fall in atrial pressure which produces Y descent in JVP. iii) Diastasis : - After the initial rapid ventricular filling, blood flows slowly and smoothly from the SVC and IVC through the right atrium into the right ventricle without any turbulence anywhere along the path. Similarly, blood from the pulmonary veins flows into the left ventricle without any turbulence. This phase of nonturbulent ventricular filling is called diastasis. The atrial pressure remains slightly greater than the ventricular pressure because inflow to atrium exceeds the outflow the atrium. iv) Last rapid filling phase (atrial systole) : - The atria contract and pump blood rapidly into the ventricles.Atrial systole is associated with sharp rise in atrial pressure which produces a-wave in JVP.",

For left ventricle mean aerial pressure of aoa and for right ventricle MAP in pulmonary aery is used.Myocardial O2 demand is not negligible at restQ. It has a constant relation (not directly propoional) to external cardiac work (during ejection phase of cardiac cycle). Myocardial O2 demand is directly propoional to hea rate but has no relation to duration of systoleQ.Myocardial oxygen consumptionBasal O2 consumption (determined by stopping the hea and aificially maintaining coronary circulation) is 2 mL/100 gm /min, which is considerably higher than that of skeletal muscleQ. O2 consumption by beating hea is 9 mL/100 gm /min at rest, which is the highest per unit mass consumption of O2Q.Due to very high O2 extraction, the aerio - venous O2 difference (ML/L) is also maximum in hea. So increase in O2 demand requires increase in coronary blood flow otherwise ischemia develops.Factors that enhance magnitude & /or rate of tension development will increase myocardial O2 demand. So increasing hea rate increases O2 demand by increasing rate (number of tension cycles developed/minute); whereas increasing inotropy (contractility) by increasing both magnitude & rate of tension developedQ.So myocardial O2 consumption is primarily determined by intramyocardialtension, contractile state & hea rateQ.Left ventricular stroke work is 7 times greater than that of right ventricle since the aoic pressure is 7 times greater than the pulmonary aery pressure. Theoratically, a 20% increase in stroke volume without a change in aerial pressure and a 20% increase in aerial pressure without a change in stroke volume should produce the same increase in 02 consumption But because of La plat relationship, pressure work (i.e, increase in after load or mean aerial pressure) produces a greater increase in 02 consumption than volume work (i.e., increase in preloadQ or stroke volume).

The thyroid and thyrotropes form a negative feedback loop: TSH production is suppressed when the T4 levels are high. The TSH production itself is modulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is produced by the hypothalamus and secreted at an increased rate in situations such as cold exposure (to stimulate thermogenesis). TSH production is blunted by somatostatin (SRIH), rising levels of glucocoicoids and sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone), and excessively high blood iodide concentration.",

They probably come from the bone marrow and enter the nervous system from the circulating blood vessels. Oligodendrogliocytes are involved in myelin formation. Astrocytes, which are found throughout the brain, are of two subtypes. Fibrous astrocytes, which contain many intermediate filaments, are found primarily in white matter. Protoplasmic astrocytes are found in gray matter and have granular cytoplasm. Both types send processes to blood vessels, where they induce capillaries to form the tight junctions that form the blood-brain barrier. They also send processes that envelop synapses and the surface of nerve cells. They have a membrane potential that varies with the external K+ concentration but do not generate propagated potentials. They produce substances that are tropic to neurons, and they help maintain the appropriate concentration of ions and neurotransmitters by taking up K+ and the neurotransmitters glutamate and -aminobutyrate.",

Step 2 - This conformational change induces changes in systems within the cell through a series of intermediate steps (transduction) that in turn brings about the response to the drug.",

        "question": "How will you calculate that how much inspired air actually ventilates the alveoli ?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Single breath N2 method Examiner is simply asking that how will you measure anatomical dead space. When air is breathed in, only the air that reaches the alveoli paicipates in gas exchange. The air in the airways (Trachea, bronchi) is breathed out unchanged as air in them does not paicipate in gaseous diffusion. Hence the airway space behaves as functionally dead so far as gas exhange is concerned. This is called 'anatomical dead space'. The volume of this space is 150 ml. That means only the first 350 ml of the 500 ml inspired with each breath (tidal volume) at rest mixes with the air in the alveoli. Conversely, with each expiration, the first 150 ml expired is gas that occupied the dead space, and only the last 350 ml is gas from the alveoli. So, normally dead space (Vd) : tidal volume (Vi) ratio is 0.30 (150: 500). Anatomical dead space is calculated by single-breath N2 method. About option 'C' Bohr equation is used to calculate physiological (total dead space). Normally, 350 ml of air enters the alveoli, with each breath. However, not all the air that enters the alveoli necessarily paicipates in alveolar gas exchange. In disease states, no diffusion (exchange) may take place between the gas in some of the alveoli and blood, and some of the alveoli may be overventilated. Such spaces in the alveoli constitues 'alveolar' dead space. The sum of anatomical dead space and alveolar dead space is called the 'physiological' dead space. Hence, the physiological dead space is the volume of inspired air, in airways (anatomical dead space) and in the alveoli (alveolar dead space), that does not paicipate in gaseous exchange. In healthy individuals, anatomical dead space and physiological dead space are identical because all the air entering into the alveoli paicipates in gaseous exchange (as alveolar diffusion, ventilation and perfusion are normal in healthy individuals).",

        "question": "With increased flow to loop of Henle, decreased in GFR is by ?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Tubulo-glomerular feedback Autoregulation of GFRThe GFR is normally well autoregulated in the range of 70-180 mm Hg of systemic pressure. Feedback mechanisms intrinsic to the kidney normally keep the renal blood flow and GFR relatively constant, despite marked changes in aerial blood pressure. The relative constancy of GFR and renal blood flow is referred to as autoregulation. The primary function of autoregulation in other tissues (other than kidneys) is to maintain the delivery of oxygen and nutrient at a normal level and to remove the waste products of metabolism, despite changes in aerial pressure. In the kidneys, the non-nal blood flow is much higher than that required for these functions. the major function of autoregulation in the kidney is to maintain a relatively constant GFR and to allow precise control of renal excretion of water and solutes.There are two plausible hypotheses for explaining the autoregulation of GFR (i) Tubuloglomerular feedback hypothesis, and (ii) Myogenic hypothesis.Tubulo-glomerular feedbackTo perform the function of autoregulation, the kidneys have a feedback mechanism that links changes in sodium chloride concentration at the macula densa with the control of renal aeriolar resistance. This feedback helps to ensure a relative constant delivery of sodium chloride to the distal tubule and helps prevent spurious fluctuations in renal excretion that would otherwise occur.The tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism has two components that act together to control GFR : - i) An afferent aeriolar feedback mechanism (usually this component is referred to as tubuloglomerular feedback, and ii) An efferent aeriolar feedback mechanism. These feedback mechanisms depend on the juxtaglomerular apparatus which consists of : (i) Macula densa, i.e., specialized epithelium of distal tubule where it comes in contact with afferent aeriole, (ii) Juxtaglomerular cells, i.e., modified smooth muscle cells of afferent aeriole, and iii) Lacis cells.Afferent aeriolar feedback mechanism : - Decrease in renal aeriolar pressure causes decrease in GFR and as a result low NaCI is delivered to distal tubules. This is sensed by macula densa and the signal is transmitted to afferent aerioles which causes decreased resistance of afferent aerioles. Decreased afferent aeriolar resistance increases glomerular hydrostatic pressure and therefore GFR. The transmitter involves is adenosine which causes opening of Ca*2 channels.Efferent aeriolar feedback mechanism : - Decreases GFR causes delivery of less NaCl to distal tubule, which is sensed by macula densa cells and the signal is transmitted to juxtaglomerular (JG) cells which secrete renin. As a result renin angiotensin system is activated and there is generation of angiotensin II which causes constriction of efferent aeriole. This results in increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and increased GFR.Opposite occurs when there is increase aerial pressure and increased GFR. Increased NaCl is delivered to the macula densa which causes constriction of afferent aeriole and decrease,: renin by JG cells with decreased efferent aeriole resistance.It would be wise to know about glomerulotubular balance, which may be confused by tubuloglomerular feedback.Glomerulotubular balance : - Tubular reabsorption in proximal tubules is load-dependent, i.e., when the GFR increase, the reabsorption of the filtrate in the proximal tubule increases propoionately. It occurs because tubular reabsorption is flow-limited. Because of glomerulotubular balance, the urinary Na+ output does not increase massively when the GFR increases.Myogenic AutoregulationAfferent aerioles constrict in response to augmented blood pressure. Aeriolar constriction restores GFR to normal levels. Possibly, stretching of aerioles leads to the opening of stretch - sensitive Ca+2 channels on aeriolar smooth muscle cells resulting in a Ca+ influx that causes the cells to contract.",

        "exp": "A i.e. Absorbed in upper small intestineThe body of young adult contains - 1100gm (27.5mol) of Ca; 90% of it is in skeleton. The plasma calcium, is normally about 10gm/dL (5meq/ L, 2.5 mmol / L)Q, of which 50% is ionized. The remainder is bound ionically to negative charged proteins (predominantly albumin & immunoglobins) or loosly complexed with phosphate, citrate, sulphate. It is the free ionizedcalcium, that is a vital second messengerQ and necessary for blood coagulation, nerve conduction and muscle contractionQ.The level of plasma calcium at which fatal tetany occurs is still above the level at which clotting defect would occur.Since the extent of calcium binding by plasma protein is propoionate to the plasma protein level, it is impoant to know the plasma protein level when evaluating the total plasma calcium. An algorithm to correct for protein changes adjusts the totalserum calcium (in mg / dL) upward by 0.8 times the defecit in serum albumin (in gm/dl) or by 0.5 times the defect in serum immunoglobin (in g/dl). So corrected calcium concentration= Total calcium level (mg/dL) + 0.8 mg/dL (0.2MM) for every decrement in serum albumin of 1.0 gm/dL (below the reference value of 4.1 gm/dL of albumin).= Total calcium level (mg/dL) + 0.5 mg/dL for every decrement in serum immunoglobulin of 1gm/dL.PH affects the calcium level, for example tetany appear at much higher total Ca++ levels, if patient hyperventilates, increasing plasma pH. Plasma proteins are more ionized when the pH is high, providing more protein anion to bind with calcium thus reducing effective amount of ionized calcium. In same way acidosis increases ionized Ca++ levelsQ.Intestinal absorption of calcium involves both active (transcellular) and passive (pa racellular) mechanism. Passive absorption is nonsaturable & approximates 5% of intake, whereas active mechanism controlled by 1, 25, (OH)2 D, normally ranges from 20- 70%. Active absorption occurs mainly in proximal small bowel (duodenum & proximal jejunum)Q. Optical rates of Ca** absorption requires gastric acidQ. This is especially true for weakly dissociable calcium supplements as Ca CO3.Calcium interchange between plasma and rapidly exchangeable reservoir of bone is 500mmol per day. Whereas between plasma and stable pool of bone is only 7.5mmol/day. 98-99% of filtered calcium is reabsorbed - 60% of which occurs in PCT and remainder in ascending loop of Henle and distal tubule.Total diffusible calcium1.34- Ionized (Ca++)1.18- Complexed to HCO 3, citrate etc0.16Total nondiffusible (protein bound) calcium1.16- Bound to albumin0.92- Bound to globulin0.24Total plasma calcium2.50",

These hormones act as signals to the gonads (testes/ovaries) that trigger the production of - i) Estrogen, progesterone and some testosterone in women. ii) Testosterone in men. In both males and females, testosterone is responsible for development of pubic hair, accelerated bone growth, body odor and acne during pubey. For boys, testosterone is responsible for the process of virilization, including the enlargement of the penis, increased libido and growth of facial and chest hair. Estrogen is the major hormone responsible for female puberal development. It causes development of breast and thickening of endometrium. Progesterone causes proliferation of acini in mammary glands and conves watery cervical secretion to viscid and scanty. Leptin facilitates release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), thereby helping in pubeal onset. Other hormones which are involved in pubey are thyroxine and growth hormone.",

As a result, calcium release from the bones is so depressed that the level of calcium in the body fluids decreases.\nWhen the parathyroid glands are suddenly removed, the calcium level in the blood falls from the normal of 9.4 mg/dl to 6 to 7 mg/dl within 2 to 3 days and the blood phosphate concentration may double. When this low calcium level is reached, the usual signs of tetany develop. Among the muscles of the body especially sensitive to tetanic spasm are the laryngeal muscles.\n\nTrousseau sign\n\tTrousseau sign is the spasm of the hand that is developed after 3 minutes of arresting the blood flow to lower arm and hand. The blood flow to lower arm and hand is arrested by inflating the blood pressure cuff 20 mm Hg above the patient\u2019s systolic pressure.\nChvostek sign\n\tChvostek sign is the twitch of the facial muscles, caused by a gentle tap over the facial nerve in front of the ear.

        "exp": "Serotonin is a vasoconstricting hormone, produced in the brain and GI tract. In the GI tract it is produced normally by enterochromaffin cells (argentaffin cells). The principal function is to regulate smooth muscle contraction and peristalsis. Serotonin: also called 5-hydroxytryptamine, is a chemical substance that is derived from the amino acid tryptophan. Principally found stored in three main cell types; (a) Serotonergic neurons in the CNS and in the intestinal myenteric plexus, (b) Enterochromaffin cells in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and (c) Blood platelets Synthesis: Serotonergic neurons and enterochromaffin cells can synthesize serotonin from its precursor amino acid L-tryptophan, whereas platelets rely upon uptake of serotonin for their stores. The biochemical pathway for serotonin synthesis initially involves the conversion of L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan by the enzyme L-tryptophan hydroxylase. This enzyme provides the rate limiting step for serotonin synthesis. Metabolism of serotonin is carried out primarily by the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO), The action of MAO conves serotonin to 5-hydroxyindole acetaldehyde which in turn is readily metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to produce 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid as the major excreted metabolite of serotonin. Carcinoid syndrome: are neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) of predominantly enterochromaffin cell origin (Kulchitsky cells).Carcinoid syndrome is made up of a constellation of symptoms which are caused by the release of a variety of substances (serotonin, histamine, and substance P, among others) by the carcinoid tumor. It may cause trytophan deficiency and causes decrease in niacin synthesis leading to pellagra. Ref: Principles of medical physiology, By Sabyasachi Sicar, Page 641.",

(But the H+ conc. in the brain parallels the aerial PCO2 and not aerial H+ conc.) There are 2 types of chemoreceptors regulating ventilation: central chemoreceptors (located in brain stem, mainly medulla) and the peripheral chemoreceptors (aoic and carotid bodies). They regulate ventilation by resonding to increased aerial H+ conc., increased PaCO2, and decreased Pa02. Thus the peripheral chemoreceptors are stimulated by hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidemia to cause hyperventilation; whereas central chemoreceptors are stimulated only by hypercapnia. Why the central chemoreceptors respond to blood PaCO2 and not to blood H+ cone?. Even though the central chemoreceptors are directly stimulated by H+ ions: the blood H+ ions are poorly permeable through the blood brain barrier and hence are not able to regulate ventilation through the central chemoreceptors. Whereas CO2 is highly permeable to the blood brain barrier. It enters the brain, where it is hydrated to give rise to H+ and HCO3- ions. Now these H+ ions directly stimulate the central chemoreceptors to regulate the ventilation. So the central chemoreceptors respond to changes in H+ ions in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstial which are brought about by changes in aerial PaCO2.

In diet iron occurs in two forms, haeme iron and inorganic (non-haeme) iron. Haem iron is better absorbed than inorganic iron, but the major fraction of diet is inorganic iron. Inorganic iron is mostly in ferric form; needs to be reduced to ferrous form because iron is absorbed in ferrous form. After absorption ferrous form is once again oxidized to ferric form inside enterocytes. A fraction of absorbed iron is rapidly delivered to plasma transferrin. However, most of the iron is deposited in the enterocytes as ferritin, some to be transferred more slowly to plasma transferrin, and some to be lost when senescent mucosal cells (enterocytes) are sloughed into the intestine. Iron absorption is regulated according to the demand, e.g., when there is iron deficiency, absorption increases. This regulation is mediated by \"iron metabolism regulatory hormone\", i.e., hepcidin that inhibit iron absorption. When there is iron deficiency, concentration of hepacidin falls and there is increase iron absorption. Hepacidin also decreases release of iron from storage sites. Transpo and storage of iron Iron is transpoed is blood in combination with a glycoprotein transferrin. Iron is transpoed into cells through attachment of transferrin to specific membrane bound receptors. Iron is stored as ferritin (major storage form) or haemosiderin. Ferritin is a complex of iron and apoferritin (iron + apoferritin ferritin). Iron is mainly stored in reticulo-endothelial cells monocytes/macrophages of liver, spleen, bonemarrow.

It is inherited as medelian autosomal dominantsQ.- ABO blood group system remains the most impoant blood group system in clinical practice because ABO antibodies are invariably present in plasma when person's RBC's lack the corresponding antigen. And because of these preformed antibodies the reaction is inunediate.Genotype of a person with A blood group may either be AA (homozygous) or AO (heterozygous). The genotype in B blood group may be BB (Hamozygous) or BO (heterozygous); in AB blood group AB and in blood group O the genotype is OO.- Highly immunogenic ABO blood group antigen is due to complex oligosaccharide (glycoprotein) found on RBC membrane. It is inherited as medelian autosomal dominantsdeg.- Alleles of ABO gene are located on long arm of chromosome 9 (and of Rh genes on chromosome 1). One of the 3 gene types (A, B, 0) determines blood group.- Individuals can be divided into 4 major blood group types on the basis of antigens (or agglutinogens) present on membrane of RBC. They are called agglutinogens as they are responsible for blood cell agglutination in transfusion reactions. Type A individuals have A antigen, type B have B, type AB have both A & B, and blood group type 0 have neither antigen.A and B antigens are complex oligosaccharides that differ in their terminal sugar moietyQ. H antigen is present in all blood types. H gene coding fucose transferase that adds a terminal fucose, forms H antigen. Individuals with type A express a second transferase that catalyzes placement of a terminal Nacetylgalactosamine on H antigen, whereas type B (individuals) express a second transferase that places a terminal galactose. Individuals with AB blood group have both and with 0 blood have neither transferases (i.e only H antigen persists in 0 group).Plasma antibodies against RBC agglutinogens are called agglutinins. Antigens very similar to A and B are very common in intestinal bacteria and possibly food to which new borns are exposed. These substances initiate the development of Anti A & Anti B antibodies. Therefore, infants rapidly develop antibodies against the antigens not present in their own cells. So type A blood group individual develop anti B, type B develop anti A, type 0 develop both, and type AB individual develop neither.Immediately after bih, the quantity of agglutinins in the plasma is almost zero. An infant begins to produce agglutinins, 2 to 8 months after bih and maximum titre is reached at 8 to 10 yrs. of age. Then it gradually declines throughout the remaining years of life.Anti A and anti B antibodies are isohaemagglutinins (iso antibodies) as they are produced by an individual against antigens produced by members of same species (isoantigens).Antibodies are usually 1gM type and cannot cross placenta. 0 type individual can produce IgG type antibodies.- The basic difference between ABO blood group system and other blood group systems (such as Rh, Kell, Duffy, MNSs blood groups), which makes the ABO group so impoant is that - preformed ABO antibodies are present in persons serum when his RBCs lack the corresponding antigen (ie. anti B antibody would be present in a person of type A and type 0 blood groups. These two blood groups do not have the 'B' antigen on the RBCs). This is not the case with other blood groups. Preformed antibodies are not present. They are formed only after an exposure to the antigen, for example Rh negative person do not have anti- Rh antibodies, these antibodies are formed only after an exposure to Rh positive blood (by a blood transfusion, i.e. this makes the first blood transfusion safe even if mismathced). These preformed antibodies, rapidly destroy the RBCs of any mismatched blood transfusion.- \"In clinical transfusion practice, the ABO blood groups are the most impoant and can never be ignored in red cell transfusion, because individuals who genetically lack any antigen, have antibodies against the red cell types that they have not inherited. These antibodies can destroy red cells rapidly in circulation\". But the question arises - why are these agglutinins (antibodies against AB antigen) produced in people who do not have the respective agglutinogens (A or B antigens) on their RBCs? The answer is that - Small amounts of group A and B antigens enter the body in food, in bacteria, and in other ways, and these substances initiate the development of the anti-A and anti-B agglutinins",

Steroid hormone receptors are pa of the nuclear receptor family that also includes a group of homologous structured receptors that bind to non-steroid ligands such as thyroid hormones and vitamin A, as well as to vitamin D. All these receptors are transcription factors. They act on nuclear DNA to regulate gene transcription. The steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, retinoic acid form pa of Group I hormones. Group 1 hormones are those which act on intracellular receptors whereas Group II hormones act on receptors located on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. Group I hormones activate gene transcription by 2 different mechanisms. Steroid hormone receptors are located within cytoplasm, in complex with heat shock protein (HSP). The steroid hormones being lipophilic readily diffuse through the plasma membrane and bind to the steroid receptors. Ligand binding causes dissociation of the heat shock protein from the receptor. The receptor ligand complex then moves into the nucleus and bind with high affinity to a specific DNA sequence called the hormone response element (HRE). This DNA-bound, liganded receptor serves as a high-affinity binding site for one or more transcription activator proteins. This complex then activates gene transcription. In contrast to steroid receptors, receptors for thyroid hormones and retinoids lie within the nucleus already bound to the Hormone response element. However this DNA-bound receptor fails to activate transcription because its complexed with a transcription repressor. This receptor-corepressor complex serves as an active repressor of gene transcription. Binding of thyroid or retionoid hormone results in dissociation of the transcription repressor from the receptor.

Electrolytes such as sodium (Na+) , and small organic compounds such as glucose, inulin are freely filteredQ (filterability = 1).Filterability of solutes is inversely related to their size. As the molecular weight of molecule approaches that of albumin, the filterability rapidly decreases, approaching zero0.75 filterability means that the substance is filtered only 75% as rapid as water. Myoglobin (F = 0.75) and albumin (F = 0.005) are not freely filteredQ.Glomerular filtrate is protein free, and devoid of any cellular element, including RBCQ. The concentration of other constituents including most salts & organic molecules, are similar to the concentration in plasma (i.e., are freely filtered). Exception to this generalization are few low molecular weight substances, such as calcium & fatty acidQ, which are paially bound to plasma proteins and thus not filtered freely.Neutral substances with molecular diameter of < 4 nanometers are filtered freely and filtration of substance > 8 nm approaches zero, as the pores of glomerular membrane are of - 8 nm (80 angstroms) size. Between 4 - 8 nm, filtration is inversely propoional to diameter. However, negatively charged large molecules are filtered less easily than positively charged molecules of equal molecular sizeQ, and even neutral molecule are filtered much more easily than negatively charged molecules of same size. This is because, the negative charges of basement membrane & podocytes restrict and repel large negatively charged and attract positively charged molecules. This explains, only 0.2% filtrability of negatively charged albumin with an effective diameter of - 7 nm.Inulin (a polymer of fructose found in dahalia tubers, MW 5200) that is freely filtered, neither reabsorbed nor secreted in tubules, and creatinine (that is freely filtered, secreted & reabsorbed in some amount) are used to measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR).",

Surfactant is a mixture of dipahnitoylphosphaticlylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. In spherical structures like the alveoli, the distending pressure equals two times the tension divided by the radius (P = 2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure.\" \"Pulmonary surfactant therefore helps stabilize the sizes of the alveoli and helps keep them open and available to paicipate in gas exchange.\" -Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems By Lauralee Sherwood p477 There are two factors which prevent the alveolar collapse: Reduction of surface tension due to surfactant The surface tension of the alveolar lining fluid varies with surface area. This is because surfactant reduces surface tension in propoion to its surface concentration. Surfactant is insoluble in water and floats on the surface of the alveolar lining fluid. In larger alveoli the surfactant is more spread out (dilute) and the surface tension is higher. As the alveoli reduce in size during expiration the concentration of the surfactant increases and the more it reduces the surface tension. 2. Alveolar interdependence There is interaction between adjacent groups of alveoli. Therefore, collapsing alveoli pull on adjacent alveoli preventing fuher collapse. This is termed alveolar interdependence.",

(The pancreas also secretes insulin, but this is not secreted by the same pancreatic tissue that secretes intestinal pancreatic juice. Instead, insulin is secreted directly into the blood-not into the intestine-by\u00a0 the\u00a0 islets\u00a0of\u00a0Langerhans\u00a0that\u00a0occur\u00a0in\u00a0islet\u00a0patches throughout the pancreas). The\u00a0most\u00a0important\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0pancreatic\u00a0enzymes\u00a0for digesting proteins are trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypolypeptidase. By far the most abundant of these is trypsin.\nTrypsin\u00a0and\u00a0chymotrypsin\u00a0split\u00a0whole\u00a0and\u00a0partially digested proteins into peptides of various sizes but do not cause\u00a0 release\u00a0 of\u00a0 individual\u00a0 amino\u00a0 acids.\u00a0However,\u00a0 carboxypolypeptidase\u00a0splits\u00a0 some\u00a0peptides\u00a0into\u00a0individual amino acids, thus completing digestion of some proteins all the way to the amino acid state. The pancreatic enzyme for digesting carbohydrates is\u00a0 pancreatic\u00a0 amylase,\u00a0which\u00a0hydrolyzes\u00a0starches, glycogen,\u00a0and\u00a0most\u00a0other\u00a0carbohydrates\u00a0 (except cellulose)\u00a0to\u00a0form\u00a0mostly\u00a0disaccharides\u00a0and a\u00a0few trisaccharides.The main enzymes for fat digestion are\n(1) pancreatic lipase, which is capable of hydrolyzing neutral fat into\u00a0 fatty\u00a0 acids\u00a0 and\u00a0 monoglycerides;\u00a0\n(2)\u00a0cholesterol esterase, which causes hydrolysis of cholesterol esters;and\u00a0\n(3)\u00a0 phospholipase,\u00a0 which\u00a0splits\u00a0fatty\u00a0acids\u00a0 from phospholipids.\nWhen\u00a0first\u00a0synthesized\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0pancreatic\u00a0cells,\u00a0the proteolytic\u00a0digestive\u00a0enzymes\u00a0are\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0inactive\u00a0forms trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and procarboxypolypeptidase, which are all inactive enzymatically. They become activated only after they are secreted into the intestinal tract. Trypsinogen is activated by an enzyme called enterokinase, which is secreted by the intestinal mucosa when chyme comes in contact with the mucosa. Also, trypsinogen can be autocatalytically activated by trypsin that has already been formed from previously secreted trypsinogen.\u00a0 Chymotrypsinogen\u00a0is\u00a0 activated\u00a0by\u00a0trypsin to\u00a0form chymotrypsin, and procarboxypolypeptidase is activated in a similar manner.",

Superficial receptors are present in the epidermis or papillary layer of dermis. In glabrous (nonhairy) skin these receptors are Merkel's disc (slowly adapting) and Meissner 's corpuscle (rapidly adapting). In hairy skin there are hair follicle receptors. Deep receptors are present in deeper dermis or in the subcutaneous tissues. The deep receptors are same in both hair and nonhairy skin and include Ruffini's end organ (slowly adapting) and Pacinian corpuscle (Rapidly adapting). Touch, pressure and vibration are different forms of same sensation. Pressure is felt when the force applied on the skin is sufficient to reach the deep receptors, whereas touch is felt when the force is insufficent to reach the deep receptors, therefore detected by superficial receptors (Merkel's disc, meissner's corpuscle). Vibrations are rhythmic variations in pressure (i.e. rhymic variations of force that reaches the deep receptors). Whether a tactile receptor senses pressure or vibration depends on whether the receptor is slowly adapting or slowly adaping :? i) Slowly adapting (Ruffini's end organ) :- Are meant to detect sustained pressure; they are useless for vibrations. ii) Rapidly adapting (Pacinian corpuscle) :- Stop discharge in response to sustained pressure; they are useful only when the pressure fluctuates rapidly, i.e. during vibrations. The higher the rate of adaptation of a receptor, the greater is the vibration frequency it can detect. Thus, tactile (touch) sensation can be divided into :? A) Superficial (generally considered as touch) :- Detected by Meissner 's corpuscle (detect texture of surface, i.e. rough or smooth) and Merkel's disc (detect two point discrimination).

The response to a standard oral test dose of glucose, the oral glucose tolerance test, is used in the clinical diagnosis of diabetesImpaired glucose tolerance in diabetes is due in pa to reduced entry of glucose into cells (decreased peripheral utilization). In the absence of insulin, the entry of glucose into skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle and other tissues is decreased.

These neurons release excitatory neurotransmitters, acetylcholine, and the neuropeptide substance P, which activates receptors on circular muscle cells to trigger contraction. The sensory neurons also excite descending interneurons that innervate inhibitory motor neurons.

This decrease in viscosity lowers the resistance to blood flow in the peripheral tissues (decreases peripheral vascular resistance) allowing even greater amounts of blood to return to the hea.

        "exp": "Ans. D: Decreases following gastrectomyIn adults, the amount of iron lost from the body is relatively small. The losses are generally unregulated, and total body stores of iron are regulated by changes in the rate at which it is absorbed from the intestine.Various dietary factors affect the availability of iron for absorption; for example, the phytic acid found in cereals reacts with iron to form insoluble compounds in the intestine. So do phosphates and oxalates.Most of the iron in the diet is in the ferric (Fe3+) form, whereas it is the ferrous (Fe2+) form that is absorbed. Fe3+ reductase activity is associated with the iron transpoer in the brush borders of the enterocytesNo more than a trace of iron is absorbed in the stomach, but the gastric secretions dissolve the iron and permit it to form soluble complexes with ascorbic acid and other substances that aid its reduction to the Fe2+ form. The impoance of this function in humans is indicated by the fact that iron deficiency anemia is a troublesome and relatively frequent complication of paial gastrectomy.Almost all iron absorption occurs in the duodenum. Some is stored in ferritin, and the remainder is transpoed out of the enterocytes by a basolateral transpoer named ferropoin 1. A protein called hephaestin (Hp) is associated with ferropoin 1. It is not a transpoer itself, but it facilitates basolateral transpo.In the plasma, Fe2+ is conveed to Fe3+and bound to the iron transpo protein transferrin. This protein has two iron-binding sites. Normally, transferrin is about 35% saturated with iron.Intestinal absorption of iron is regulated by three factors: recent dietary intake of iron, the state of the iron stores in the body, and the state of erythropoiesis in the bone marrow.",

They are non peristaltic, non progressive and occur with both voluntary and involuntary swallow. Primary peristaltic contractions are the major stripping wave that are initiated by the act of swallowing and that propel ingested material through the entire length of the oesophagus into the stomach. Primary peristaltic contractions are progressive and move down the oesophagus at rate of 2 to 4 cm/sec and reach the LES about 9 seconds after the initiation of swallowing. It relaxes the lower oesophageal sphincter before the bolus reaches it. Secondary peristaltic contractions are also progressive, similar to primary peristalsis but elicited by different stimuli. Rather than beginning with swallowing, as in primary peristalsis, the secondary peristaltic wave occurs in response to distension or irritation anywhere along the oesophagus. It begins at the level of the focus of stimulation and propels oesophageal contents distally. In effect, secondary peristalsis is a mechanism for ridding the oesophagus of refluxed gastric contents or material left behind after the progression of the primary peristaltic wave.",

Whereas, ghrelin another gastrointestinal hormone produced mainly by stomach is orexigenic (i.e. increase appetite). - Growth hormone (GH) also k/a somatotropic hormone or somatotropin exes much of its effects through intermediate substances called somatomedins secreted by liver (and to a much less extent, other tissues). Because many effects of somatomedins on growth are similar to those of insulin, therefore somatomedins are also called insulin like growth factors (IGFs). Out of 4 somatomedins isolated, the most impoant is somatomedin C (or IGF-1) and pygmies of Africa & Levi-Lorain dwarf have congenital inability to synthesize significant amount of IGF-1. - Orexin (hypocretin) producing neurons occur in hypothalamus. Orexins A and B increase feeding (appetite) whereas, brains from humans with narcolepsy have fewer orexin producing neurons in hypothalamus. - Cholecystokinin (CCK) is secreted by I cells of upper small intestine (jejunum) and decreases feeding (antiorexigenic / aorexigenic), inhibits gastric emptying, and stimulates secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes, contraction of gall bladder, secretion of glucagon & insulin and small intestine & colonic motality. It is a gastrointestinal hormone synthesized & released mainly by oxyntic cells of stomach (Guyton) / P or D1 cells of fundus of stomach. It is also produced by the intestine & epsilon cells of pancreas in small amounts. Ghrelin acts to stimulate hunger (appetite)Q. So blood levels rise during fasting, peak just before eating and then fall rapidly after a meal (orexigenic). In this way, it is counter pa of hormone leptin, produced by adipose tissue, which induces satiation (i.e. is anti-orexigenic) when present at higher levels. - Ghrelin is also produced in arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus and has marked growth hormone stimulating activity i.e. it stimulates GH secretion from anterior pituitary gland by acting directly on receptors in pituitary. - G protein coupled ghrelin receptor formerly k/a growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) receptor is expressed in arcuate nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, vagal afferent cell bodies & vagal afferent endings through out gastrointestinal tract. - It has an impoant role in neurotrophy, paicularly in hippocampus and is essential for cognitive adaptation to changing environment and process of learning.",

        "question": "Not done by insulin:",
        "exp": "Ketogenesis Repeat,from May 09 Lack of insulin promotes ketogenesis. Insulin prevents ketngenesis. Metabolic Effects of Insulin Insulin is known as hormone of abundance. When there is great abundance of energy-giving foods in the diet, especially excess amounts of carbohydrates, insulin is secreted in large amounts. The net effect of insulin is storage of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Therefore, insulin is called the hormone of abundance. In the case of excess carbohydrates, it causes them to be stored as glycogen mainly in the liver and muscles. Also, all the excess carbohydrates that cannot be stored as glycogen are conveed under the stimulus of insulin into fats and stored in the adipose tissue. In the case of proteins, insulin has a direct effect in promoting amino acid uptake by cells and conversion of these amino acids into protein. In addition, it inhibits the breakdown of the proteins that are already in the cells. Effect of Insulin on Carbohydrate Metabolism Immediately after a high-carbohydrate meal, the glucose that is absorbed into the blood causes rapid secretion of insulin. The insulin in turn causes rapid uptake, storage, and use of glucose by almost all tissues of the body, but especially by the muscles, adipose tissue, and liver. Insulin promotes liver uptake and storage as glycogen One of the most impoant of all the effects of insulin is to cause most of the glucose absorbed after a meal to be stored almost immediately in the liver in the form of glycogen. Then, between meals, when food is not available and the blood glucose concentration begins to fall, insulin secretion decreases rapidly and the liver glycogen is split back into glucose, which is released back into the blood to keep the glucose concentration from falling too low. The mechanism by which insulin causes glucose uptake and storage in the liver includes several almost simultaneous steps: Insulin inactivates liver phosphorylase, the principal enzyme that causes liver glycogen to split into glucose. This prevents breakdown of the glycogen that has been stored in the liver cells. Insulin increases the activity of the enzyme glucokinase, which is one of the enzymes that causes the initial phosphorylation of glucose after it diffuses into the liver cells. Once phosphorylated, the glucose is temporarily trapped inside the liver cells because phosphorylated glucose cannot diffuse back through the cell membrane. iii. Insulin also increases the activities of the enzymes that promote glycogen synthesis, including especially glycogen synthase, which is responsible for polymerization of the monosaccharide units to form the glycogen molecules. Insulin Promotes Conversion of Excess Glucose into Fatty Acids When the quantity of glucose entering the liver cells is more than can be stored as glycogen or can be used for local hepatocyte metabolism, insulin promotes the conversion of all this excess glucose into fatty acids. These fatty acids are subsequently packaged as triglycerides in very-low-density lipoproteins and transpoed in this form by way of the blood to the adipose tissue and deposited as fat. Insulin also inhibits gluconeogenesis. Insulin Promotes Muscle Glucose Uptake and Metabolism Without insulin muscle membrane is only slightly permeable to glucose. Thus between meals, non-exercising muscles, derive their energy from fatty acids, not on glucose. In the presence of insulin, muscle membrane become permeable to glucose. If the muscles are not exercising after a meal and yet glucose is transpoed into the muscle cells in abundance, then most of the glucose is stored in the form of muscle glycogen instead of being used for energy. The glycogen can later be used for energy by the muscle. Effect of Insulin on Carbohydrate Metabolism in Other Cells Insulin increases glucose transpo into and glucose usage by most other cells of the body (with the exception of the brain cells, as noted) in the same way that it affects glucose transpo and usage in muscle cells. Effect of Insulin on Fat Metabolism Although not quite as visible as the acute effects of insulin on carbohydrate metabolism, insulin's effects on fat metabolism are, in the long run, equally impoant. Long-term effect of insulin lack causes extreme atherosclerosis, often leading to hea attacks, cerebral strokes, and other vascular accidents. Insulin Promotes Fat Synthesis and Storage Fat sparing effect-Insulin has several effects that lead to fat storage in adipose tissue. First, insulin increases the utilization of glucose by most of the body's tissues, which automatically decreases the utilization of fat, thus functioning as a fat sparer. Insulin also promotes fatty acid synthesis. Synthesis of fat in liver-When more carbohydrates are ingested than can be used for immediate energy, are used for fat synthesis. Almost all this synthesis occurs in the liver cells, and the fatty acids are then transpoed from the liver by way of the blood lipoproteins to the adipose cells to be stored. Storage of fat in the adipose Cells. Insulin has two other essential effects that are required for fat storage in adipose cells: Insulin inhibits the action of hormone-sensitive lipase. This is the enzyme that causes hydrolysis of the triglycerides already stored in the fat cells. Therefore, the release of fatty acids from the adipose tissue into the circulating blood is inhibited. Insulin promotes glucose transpo through the cell membrane into the fat cells in exactly the same ways that it promotes glucose transpo into muscle cells. Some of this glucose is then used to synthesize minute amounts of fatty acids, but more impoant, it also forms large quantities of a-glycerol phosphate. This substance supplies the glycerol that combines with fatty acids to form the triglycerides that are the storage form of fat in adipose cells. Therefore, when insulin is not available, even storage of the large amounts of fatty acids transpoed from the liver in the lipoproteins is almost blocked. Insulin Deficiency Increases Use of Fat for Energy Insulin Deficiency Causes Lipolysis of Storage Fat and Release of Free Fatty Acids. In the absence of insulin, hormone-sensitive lipase in the fat cells becomes strongly activated. This causes hydrolysis of the stored triglycerides, releasing large quantities of fatty acids and glycerol into the circulating blood. This free fatty acid then becomes the main energy substrate used by essentially all tissues of the body besides the brain. Insulin Deficiency Increases Plasma Cholesterol and Phospholipid Concentrations. The excess of fatty acids in the plasma associated with insulin deficiency also promotes liver conversion of some of the fatty acids into phospholipids and cholesterol, two of the major products of fat metabolism. This high lipid concentration--especially the high concentration of cholesterol--promotes the development of atherosclerosis in people with serious diabetes. Excess Usage of Fats During Insulin Lack Causes Ketosis and Acidosis. Insulin lack also causes excessive amounts of acetoacetic acid to be formed in the liver cells. Some of the acetoacetic acid is also conveed into 13-hydroxybutyric acid and acetone. These two substances, along with the acetoacetic acid, are called ketone bodies, and their presence in large quantities in the body fluids is called ketosis. In severe diabetes the acetoacetic acid and the I3-hydroxybutyric acid can cause severe acidosis and coma, which often leads to death. Effect of Insulin on Protein Metabolism Insulin Promotes Protein Synthesis and Storage. During the few hours after a meal when excess quantities of nutrients are available in the circulating blood, not only carbohydrates and fats but proteins as well are stored in the tissues; insulin is required for this to occur. The manner in which insulin causes protein storage is not as well understood as the mechanisms for both glucose and fat storage. Some of the facts follow. Insulin stimulates transpo of many of the amino acids into the cells. Among the amino acids most strongly transpoed are valine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. Insulin increases the translation of messenger RNA, thus forming new proteins. Over a longer period of time, insulin also increases the rate of transcription of selected DNA genetic sequences in the cell nuclei, thus forming increased quantities of RNA and still more protein synthesis--especially promoting a vast array of enzymes for storage of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. 4. Insulin inhibits the catabolism of proteins, thus decreasing the rate of amino acid release from the cells, especially from the muscle cells. 5. In the liver, insulin depresses the rate of gluconeogenesis. Because the substrates most used for synthesis of glucose by gluconeogenesis are the plasma amino acids, this suppression of gluconeogenesis conserves the amino acids in the protein stores of the body. In summary, insulin promotes protein formation and prevents the degradation of proteins. Note that: The brain is quite different from most other tissues of the body in that insulin has little effect on uptake or use of glucose. Instead, the brain cells are permeable to glucose and can use glucose without the intermediation of insulin. The brain cells are also quite different from most other cells of the body in that they normally use only glucose for energy and can use other energy substrates, such as fats, only with difficulty.Therefore, it is essential that the blood glucose level always be maintained above a critical level, which is one of the most impoant functions of the blood glucose control system. When the blood glucose falls too low, into the range of 20 to 50 mg/100 ml. symptoms of hypoglycemic shock develop, characterized by progressive nervous irritability that leads to fainting, seizures, and even coma.
