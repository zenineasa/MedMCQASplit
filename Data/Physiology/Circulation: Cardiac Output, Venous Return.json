During other six phases, atria are relaxed, i.e., atrial diastole,o However, it should be kept in the mind that above described durations of cardiac cycle are not fixed, the durations of various phases of the cardiac cycle depend on the heart rate,o When the heart rate increases, the durations of all the phases decreases,o However, the duration of diastole decreases much more than duration of systole,o The marked reduction in diastolic time during tachycardia has important clinical implication,o It is during diastole that most of the ventricular filling occurs.o Also, it is during diastole that most of the cardiac muscle, especially the subendocardial portion of the left ventricle, gets adequately perfused by the coronary blood flow.o Hence, at heart rates greater than 180 per minute, there is reduction in ventricular filling (which tends to reduce cardiac output) and cardiac perfusion (which tends to cause myocardial ischemia and infarction).",
