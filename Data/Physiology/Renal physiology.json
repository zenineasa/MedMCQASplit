        "exp": "Micturition is initiated by activation of afferent sensory fibers located in the wall of the bladder; these fibers sense the degree of stretch of the bladder wall. In addition, these sensory fibers travel back to the spinal cord sacral dorsal roots. The sensory information that reaches the spinal cord also travels to the micturition center in the rostral pons. When sensory activity to the micturition center is sufficient, a command is sent to the sacral spinal cord, leading to activation of parasympathetic fibers. The parasympathetic fibers travel to the bladder the pelvic nerve. Activation of these fibers leads to bladder contraction. Destruction of the sacral dorsal roots (as occurs with tabes dorsalis) abolishes the reflex because sensory afferent fibers no longer send signals back to the spinal cord. A spinal cord injury at L1 is well above the sacral region where the micturition reflex originates. However, the central nervous system (CNS) plays an impoant role in facilitating or inhibiting the micturition reflex, and this function is lost with spinal cord injury. Although some patients with spinal cord injury can still elicit a micturition response (e.g., stroking of the skin in the genital region), the bladder in these patients has increased muscle tone and fails to empty completely. As the bladder becomes more and more distended, an involuntary micturition reflex can occur. However, the CNS can keep urine from being voided under these circumstances by maintaining a constant tonic contraction of the external sphincter. This contraction is accomplished through continued activation of somatic nerves that travel in the pudendal nerve from the sacral spinal cord to the external sphincter. The point at which an urge to void first occurs corresponds to a bladder volume of approximately 150 ml. However, bladder volume can increase more than twofold before involuntary micturition occurs. At 400 ml a marked sense of fullness is present. Parasympathetic fibers originating in the sacral spinal cord innervate the body of the bladder, and it is activation of these fibers that leads to bladder contraction.",

This capacity is well developed in the kidneys (), but it has also been observed in the mesentery, skeletal muscle, brain, liver, and myocardium. It is probably due in pa to the intrinsic contractile response of smooth muscle to stretch (myogenic theory of autoregulation). As the pressure rises, the blood vessels are distended and the vascular smooth muscle fibers that surround the vessels contract. If it is postulated that the muscle responds to the tension in the vessel wall, this theory could explain the greater degree of contraction at higher pressures; the wall tension is propoional to the distending pressure times the radius of the vessel (law of Laplace; see Chapter 32), and the maintenance of a given wall tension as the pressure rises would require a decrease in radius.

A plot of intravesical pressure against the volume of fluid in the bladder is called a cystometrogram). The curve shows an initial slight rise in pressure when the first increments in volume are produced; along, nearly flat segment as fuher increments are produced; and a sudden, sharp rise in pressure as the micturition reflex is triggered. These three components are sometimes called segments Ia, Ib, and II. The first urge to void is felt at a bladder volume of about 150 mL, and a marked sense of fullness about 400 mL. The flatness of segment Ib is a manifestation of the law of Laplace. This law states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ fill, but so does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full.

As the rate of flow through the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and first pa of the distal tubule increases, glomerular filtration in the same nephron decreases, and, conversely, a decrease in flow increases the GFR. This process, which is called tubuloglomerular feedback, tends to maintain the constancy of the load delivered to the distal tubule. The sensor for this response is the macula densa. The amount of fluid entering the distal tubule at the end of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle depends on the amount of Na+ and Cl- in it. The Na+ and Cl- enter the macula densa cells the Na-K-2Cl cotranspoer in their apical membranes. The increased Na+ causes increased Na, K ATPase activity and the resultant increased ATP hydrolysis causes more adenosine to be formed. Presumably, adenosine is secreted from the basal membrane of the cells. It acts adenosine A1 receptors on the macula densa cells to increase their release of Ca2+ to the vascular smooth muscle in the afferent aerioles. This causes afferent vasoconstriction and a resultant decrease in GFR. Presumably, a similar mechanism generates a signal that decreases renin secretion by the adjacent juxtaglomerular cells in the afferent aeriole, but this remains unsettled.

Renin, stimulated by juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney in response to decreased blood volume and serum sodium levels, acts as an enzyme in the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is rapidly hydrolyzed to form the active compound, angiotensin II. The vasoconstrictive action of angiotensin II decreases the glomerular filtration rate, and the concomitant action of aldosterone promotes sodium retention, with the result that blood volume and sodium reabsorption increase.

Micturition Reflex Micturition is fundamentally a spinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers and is subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition. These centers include Strong facilitative and inhibitory centers in the brain stem, located mainly in the pons Several centers located in the cerebral coex that is mainly inhibitory but can become excitatory. The micturition reflex is the basic cause of micturition, but higher centers normally exe final control of micturition. Micturition reflex is the result of a stretch reflex initiated by sensory stretch receptors in the bladder wall, especially by the receptors in the posterior urethra when this area begins to fill with urine at the higher bladder pressures. Sensory signals from the bladder stretch receptors are conducted to the sacral segments of the cord through the pelvic nerves and then reflexively back again to the bladder through the parasympathetic nerve fibers by way of these same nerves. As the bladder continues to fill, the micturition reflexes become more frequent and cause greater contraction of the detrusor muscle. Once a micturition reflex begins, it is &;self-regenerative&; It is a single complete cycle of The progressive and rapid increase of pressure A period of sustained pressure and Return of the pressure to the basal tone of the bladder. As the bladder becomes more and more fiilled, micturition reflexes occur more and more often and more and more powerfully. Once micturition reflex becomes powerful enough, it causes another reflex, which passes through the pudendal nerves to the extrenal sphincter to inhibit it. If this inhibition is more potent in the brain than the voluntary constrictor signals to the extrenal sphincter, urination will occur. If not, urination will not occur until the bladder fills still fuher and the micturition reflex becomes more powerful. Ref: Guyton and Hall 13th edition Pgno: 329-330",

        "exp": "Whenever blood flow to the kidney diminishes, renin is secreted and angiotensin is formed. The angiotensin causes widespread vasoconstriction and elevation of blood pressure consequent to greatly increased total peripheral resistance. A second effect, the increased secretion of aldosterone, results in retention of salt and water by the kidneys and therefore increased extracellular fluid volume, cardiac output, and aerial pressure. Additionally, the angiotensin acts directly on the kidneys to cause salt and water retention, which causes a long-term increase in aerial blood pressure.Ref: Ganong&;s Review of Medical Physiology, 23rd edition, page no: 669",

        "question": "Renin secretion is increased by all except",
        "exp": "Several different factors regulate renin secretion, and the rate of renin secretion at any given time is determined by the summed activity of these factors. One factor is an intrarenal baroreceptor mechanism that causes renin secretion to decrease when aeriolar pressure at the level of the JG cells increases and to increase when aeriolar pressure at this level falls. Another renin-regulating sensor is in the macula densa. Renin secretion is inversely propoional to the amount of Na+ and Cl- entering the distal renal tubules from the loop of Henle. Presumably, these electrolytes enter the macula densa cells the Na-K-2Cl- transpoers in their apical membranes and the increase in some fashion triggers a signal that decreases renin secretion in the juxtaglomerular cells in the adjacent afferent aerioles. A possible mediator is NO, but the identity of the signal remains unsettled. Renin secretion also varies inversely with the plasma K+ level, but the effect of K+ appears to be mediated by the changes it produces in Na+ and Cl- delivery to the macula densa. Angiotensin II feeds back to inhibit renin secretion by a direct action on the JG cells. Vasopressin also inhibits renin secretion in vitro and in vivo, although there is some debate about whether it&;s in vivo effect is direct or indirect. Finally, increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system increases renin secretion. The increase is mediated both by increased circulating catecholamines and by norepinephrine secreted by postganglionic renal sympathetic nerves. The catecholamines act mainly on b1-adrenergic receptors on the JG cells and renin release is mediated by an increase in intracellular cAMP. The principal conditions that increase renin venous pressure, which triggers an increase in sympathetic activity, and some also decrease renal aeriolar pressure . Renal aery constriction and constriction of the aoa proximal to the renal aeries produces a decrease in renal aeriolar pressure. Psychologic stimuli increase the activity of the renal nerves.

Movement of water across membranes by simple diffusion is now known to be augmented by movement through water channels called aquaporins, and to date 13 (AQP0-AQP12) have been identified and water channels are now known to be expressed in almost all tissues in the body. The vasopressin-responsive water channel in the collecting ducts is aquaporin-2. V1A receptors mediate the vasoconstrictor effect of vasopressin, and vasopressin is a potent stimulator of smooth muscle in vitro. V1A receptors are also found in the liver and the brain. Vasopressin causes glycogenolysis in the liver, and, as noted above, it is a neurotransmitter in the brain and spinal cord. The V1B receptors (also called V3 receptors) appear to be unique to the anterior pituitary, where they mediate increased adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion from the coicotropes.

As water flows up the ascending limb of loop of Henle, solutes are reabsorbed, but this segment is relatively impermeable to water; progressive dilution of the tubular fluid occurs so that the osmolarity decreases to approximately 100 mOsm/L by the time the fluid reaches the early distal tubule. Even during maximal antidiuresis this poion of the renal tubule is relatively impermeable to water and is therefore called the diluting segment of the renal tubule. The descending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to water: The fluid in the descending limb of the loop of Henle becomes hypeonic as water moves out of the segment into the hypeonic interstitium. Ascending limb of loop of Henle is impermeable to water: While water stays within the tubule, sodium, potassium and chloride are cotranspoed out of the thick segment of the ascending limb. The fluid in the ascending limb therefore becomes more dilute, and when it reaches the top, it is almost always hypotonic to plasma. Even during maximal antidiuresis this poion of the renal tubule is relatively impermeable to water and is therefore called the diluting segment of the renal tubule. Fluid in the distal tubule: Therefore, the fluid that is delivered to the distal tubule is always hypotonic. Progressive dilution of the tubular fluid in ascending limb of loop of henle causes a decrease in osmolarity such that the osmolarity decreases to approximately 100 mOsm/L by the time the fluid reaches the early distal tubule. Formation of a concentrated urine when antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels are high. The fluid in the descending limb of the loop of henle becomes hypeonic as water moves out of the segment into the hypeonic interstitium.

Note that the fluid leaving the loop of Henle and fluid entering the distal tubule is always dilute (hypotonic to the plasma) even in the presence of ADH (100 mOsm/L) The fluid in the presence of ADH becomes concentrated as water is absorbed from the distal tubules and collecting tubules. With high ADH levels, the osmolarity of the urine is about the same as the osmolarity of the renal medullary interstitial fluid in the pailla, which is about 1200 mOsm/L.

In metabolic acidosis, HCO3- levels decrease. Hence, this is a case of metabolic acidosis. Step 3: As per Winter&;s formula , the expected respiratory compensation in metabolic acidosis can be calculated using, pCO2= (1.5*) + 8 +/- 2 = 26+/- 2 = 24-28 mmHg.

ANP acts at the kidney to increase sodium excretion, and is secreted in response to blood volume expansion or increased sodium chloride intake. Circulating levels of ANP are increased in congestive hea failure, a condition in which atrial pressure is chronically elevated. The exact mechanisms for the natriuretic effect are not completely known. ANP increases glomerular filtration rate without a sustained increase in renal blood flow, which suggests that the peptide may constrict efferent aerioles. Fuhermore, ANP relaxes mesangial cells in the glomeruli, thereby increasing surface area available for filtration. Finally, ANP may directly inhibit sodium reabsorption by renal tubules. The actions of ANP are generally opposite to those of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. ANP inhibits the secretion of renin and aldo sterone.ANP produces its effects by increasing intracellular formation of cGMP. The ANP receptor has a cytoplasmic domain with guanylyl cyclase activity, which is increased by hormone-receptor binding.",

        "exp": "A high plasma renin activity (PRA) is present in patients who are taking angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitors.Renin is a proteolytic enzyme that is synthesized and stored in the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus, which consists of the juxtaglomerular cells (specialized myoepithelial cells) and the cells of the macula densa, located in the distal tubule. The JG cells surround the afferent aerioles of glomeruli in the kidneys. Once released, renin acts on angiotensinogen, which is synthesized in the liver, and conves it into the decapeptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then enzymatically transformed into angiotensin II (All), an octapeptide, by conveing enzymes located in the kidney and the pulmonary vascular endothelium in the lungs. AII is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor that directly acts on aeriolar smooth cells in the resistance vessels. In addition, it stimulates the efferent aerioles in the kidneys and has a negative feedback on renin release. All, along with the nonapeptide AIII, also stimulates the release of aldosterone from the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal coex. Aldosterone enhances the distal and early collecting tubule reabsorption of sodium in exchange for potassium and/or hydrogen ions.An angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitor, such as captopril, increases PRA because it is the negative feedback inhibition of All on renin release. This treatment is used to test for stimulation of renin release, paicularly in renovascular hypeension, in which there is an exaggerated increase in PRA.",

Cystometrogram The curve shows An initial slight rise in pressure when the first increments in the volume are produced (Ia); A long, nearly flat segment as fuher increments are produced (Ib) A sudden, sharp rise in pressure as the micturition reflex is triggered (II) The flatness of segment Ib is a manifestation of the law of Laplace. This law states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. P= 2T/R In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ fill but does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full.

Mineralocoicoid escape refers to the fact that the salt-retaining action of mineralocoicoids does not persist but is overpowered by factors that promote renal Na+ excretion. Saturation of transpo occurs when the maximal rate of tubular transpo is reached. Tubuloglomerular feedback results in afferent aeriolar constriction when fluid delivery to the macula densa is increased; it contributes to renal autoregulation. Glomerulotubular balance: More the filtered load, more the reabsorbed load (load-dependent reabsorption). What is reabsorbed is a constant percentage and not a constant amount. This helps in preserving the solute. The possible mechanism for glomerulotubular balance: As more fluid comes out of the glomerulus (due to increase in GFR), the protein concentration and therefore the oncotic pressure in the plasma increases. When the plasma comes to the peritubular capillaries, there is an increased oncotic pressure; this results in pulling the excess water in the tubular lumen into the capillaries. Along with the flow of water, sodium is also reabsorbed (this is known as bulk flow or solvent drag).",
