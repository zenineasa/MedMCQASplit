        "exp": "Nutrition experiments with various levels of calorie and protein intake were carried out on five healthy young men. Three series of experiments with two persons each were undeaken for periods up to 14 days. The first pa of each experiment, with 1100 to 1500 kcal/day, was immediately followed by the second pa, with 3500 to 2300 kcal/day. The concentrations of insulin, free fatty acids, glucose and amino acids were determined in the morning, fasted blood. The nitrogen balance was also determined. When insufficient carbohydrate intake is coupled with normal and high protein content of the food, there is interindividually an initial drop in the insulin concentration. Regardless of the absolute insulin concentration, this drop causes an increase in the free fatty acids and the branched-chain amino acids, together with a decrease in the concentrations of alanine and glycine (threonine) in the blood and a negative nitrogen balance. The high concentrations of branched-chain amino acids and the low threonine concentrations might be involved as feedback regulators in the fuher regulation of the gluconeogenic metabolism. When carbohydrate calories are added to the diet, a simultaneous decrease in the free fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids and increase in the blood concentrations of insulin, alanine, glycine and threonine within 24 to 48 h are only observed with 3500 kcal/day and 0.8 to 1.4 g protein per kg body weight. A positive nitrogen balance, however, is only observed with 1.4 g protein per kg body weight, regardless of the relative changes in the insulin level, while the increase in alanine and decrease in branched-chain amino acids (valine) are greatest at 0.8 g protein per kg body weight and day. In spite of the high glucose level, the falling insulin level provokes counter-regulatory processes in which the low concentrations of branched-chain amino acids and the high threonine (alanine) concentrations may play a role.

        "exp": "Thermoregulation in humans is an impoant aspect of homeostasis. In thermoregulation, body heat is generated mostly in the deep organs, especially the liver, brain, and hea, and in contraction of skeletal muscles. Humans have been able to adapt to a great diversity of climates, including hot humid and hot arid and cold climates. For humans, adaptation to varying climatic conditions includes both physiological mechanisms resulting from evolution and behavioral mechanisms resulting from conscious cultural adaptations.Shivering - Muscles can also receive messages from the thermoregulatory center of the brain (the hypothalamus) to cause shivering. This increases heat production as respiration is an exothermic reaction in muscle cells. Shivering is more effective than exercise at producing heat because the animal (includes humans) remains still. Vasoconstriction - Aerioles carrying blood to superficial capillaries under the surface of the skin can shrink (constrict), thereby rerouting blood away from the skin and towards the warmer core of the body. This prevents blood from losing heat to the surroundings and also prevents the core temperature dropping fuher. This process is called vasoconstriction. Thyroxine - An iodine-containing hormone, produced by the thyroid gland, that increases the rate of cell metabolism.Piloerection - The minute muscles under the surface of the skin called arrector pili muscles (attached to an individual hair follicle) contract (piloerection), lifting the hair follicle upright. This makes the hairs stand on end, which acts as an insulating layer, trapping heat.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology-24th edition, page no-318",

        "question": "Hypothyroidism causes CNS features because of presence of which receptor in brain?",
        "exp": "Thyroid hormones enter cells and T3 binds to thyroid receptors (TR) in the nuclei. T4 can also bind, but not as avidly. The hormone-receptor complex then binds to DNA zinc fingers and increases (or in some cases, decreases) the expression of a variety of different genes that code for proteins that regulate cell function (see Chapter 1). Thus, the nuclear receptors for thyroid hormones are members of the superfamily of hormone-sensitive nuclear transcription factors. There are two human TR genes: an a receptor gene on chromosome 17 and a b receptor gene on chromosome 3. By alternative splicing, each forms at least two different mRNAsand therefore two different receptor proteins. TRb2 is found only in the brain, but TRa1, TRa2, and TRb1 are widely distributed. TRa2 differs from the other three in that it does not bind T3 and its function is not yet fully established. TRs bind to DNA as monomers, homodimers, and heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, paicularly the retinoid X receptor (RXR). The TR/RXR heterodimer does not bind 9-cis retinoic acid, the usual ligand for RXR, but TR binding to DNA is greatly enhanced in response to thyroid hormones when the receptor is in the form of this heterodimer. There are also coactivator and corepressor proteins that affect the actions of TRs. Presumably, this complexity underlies the ability of thyroid hormones to produce many different effects in the body. In most of its actions, T3 acts more rapidly and is three to five times more potent than T4.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:308,309",

These molecules are not lipid-soluble and therefore cannot diffuse through cell membranes. Consequently, receptors for peptide hormones are located on the plasma membrane.Steroid hormone receptors and related receptors are generally soluble proteins that function through gene activation. Their response elements are DNA sequences (promoters) that are bound by the complex of the steroid bound to its receptor. The receptors themselves are zinc-finger proteins.

Various bone and metabolic diseases also cause stunted growth, and in many cases there is no known cause (\"constitutionally delayed growth\"). Chronic abuse and neglect can also cause dwarfism in children, independent of malnutrition. This condition is known as psychosocial dwarfism or the Kaspar Hauser syndrome, named for the patient with the first repoed case. Finally, Achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism in humans, is characterized by sho limbs with a normal trunk. It is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). This member of the fibroblast growth receptor family is normally expressed in cailage and the brain. In another group of dwarfed children, the plasma growth hormone concentration is normal or elevated but their growth hormone receptors are unresponsive as a result of loss-of-function mutations. The resulting condition is known as growth hormone insensitivity or Laron dwarfism. Plasma IGF-I is markedly reduced, along with IGFBP 3, which is also growth hormone-dependent.",

The Seoli cells secrete the androgen-binding protein (ABP), inhibin, and MIS. They do not synthesize androgens, but they contain aromatase (CYP19), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens, and they can produce estrogens. ABP probably functions to maintain a high, stable supply of androgen in the tubular fluid. Inhibin inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion.\"",

If the skin temperature is greater than that of the surroundings, the body can lose heat by radiation and conduction. But, if the temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the skin, the body actually gains heat by radiation and conduction. In such conditions, the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation. So, when the surrounding temperature is higher than the skin temperature, anything that prevents adequate evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise. During intense physical activity (e.g. spos), evaporation becomes the main avenue of heat loss. Humidity affects thermoregulation by limiting sweat evaporation and thus heat loss.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology;24th edition; page no-316",

        "question": "Which of the following increases BMR?",
        "exp": "Factors that influence basal metabolic rate are: Body size: Metabolic rate increases as weight, height, and surface area increase. Body composition: Fat tissue has a lower metabolic activity than muscle tissue. As lean muscle mass increases, metabolic rate increases. Gender: The basal metabolic rate (BMR) averages 5 to 10 percent lower in women than in men. This is largely because women generally possess more body fat and less muscle mass than men of similar size. Age: A decrease in lean muscle mass during adulthood results in a slow, steady decline of roughly 0 3 percent per year in BMR after the age of about 30. This can be largely avoided by strength training throughout adulthood. Climate and body temperature: The BMR of people in tropical climates is generally 5 to 20 percent higher than their counterpas living in more temperate areas because it takes energy to keep the body cool. Exercise performed in hot weather also imposes an additional metabolic load. Body fat content and effectiveness of clothing determine the magnitude of increase in energy metabolism in cold environments; it takes energy to keep the body warm if you work or exercise in very cold weather. Hormonal levels: Thyroxine (T4), the key hormone released by the thyroid glands has a significant effect upon metabolic rate. Hypothyroidism is relatively common, especially in women near or after menopause. Everyone with a weight problem should have their thyroid function checked by their doctor and treated appropriately if it turns out to be low.
