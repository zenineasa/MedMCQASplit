It is sometimes confused for anosmia--a loss of the sense of smell. Because the tongue can only indicate texture and differentiate between sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami most of what is perceived as the sense of taste is actually derived from smell. True aguesia is relatively rare compared to hypogeusia--a partial loss of taste--and dysgeusia--a distortion or alteration of taste.> Causes of Ageusia:> Neurological damage: Tissue damage to the nerves that support the tongue can cause ageusia, especially damage to the lingual nerve and the glossopharyngeal nerve.> Neurological disorders such as Bell's palsy, Familial dysautonomia, and Multiple sclerosis cause similar problems to nerve dam- age, as do certain infectious conditions like primary amoeboid meningoencephalopathy. The lingual nerve (which is a branch of the trigeminal V3 nerve, but carries taste sensation back to the chorda tympani nerve to the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve) can also be damaged during otologic surgery, causing a feeling of metal taste.> Problems with the endocrine system:> Deficiency of vitamin B3 (Niacin) and zinc can cause problems with the endocrine system, which may cause taste loss or alteration. Disorders of the endocrine system, such as Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus, can cause similar problems.> Ageusia can also be caused by medicinal side-effects from antirheumatic drugs such as penicillamine, antiproliferative drugs such as cisplatin, ACE inhibitors, and other drugs including azelastine, clarithromycin and zopiclone.> Other causes:> Local damage and inflammation that interferes with the taste buds or local nervous system such as that stemming from radiation therapy, glossitis, tobacco abuse, and denture use also cause ageusia.

At rest, the proton pumps are sequestered within the parietal cell in a series of membrane compartments known as tubulovesicles. When the parietal cell begins to secrete, on the other hand, these vesicles fuse with invaginations of the apical membrane known as canaliculi, thereby substantially amplifying the apical membrane area and positioning the proton pumps to begin acid secretion. The apical membrane also contains potassium channels, which supply the K+ ions to be exchanged for H+, and Cl- channels that supply the counterion for HCI secretio. The secretion of protons is also accompanied by the release of equivalent numbers of bicarbonate ions into the blood-stream, which are later used to neutralize gastric acidity once its function is complete.",

        "exp": "(B) Na++ # Resting membrane potential of individual mammalian cardiac muscle cells is about -90 mV (interior negative to exterior). Stimulation produces a propagated action potential that is responsible for initiating contraction. Depolarization proceeds rapidly, and an overshoot is present, as in skeletal muscle and nerve, but this is followed by a plateau before the membrane potential returns to the baseline. In mammalian hearts, depolarization lasts about 2 ms, but the plateau phase and repolarization last 200 ms or more. Repolarization is therefore not complete until the contraction is half over. With extracellular recording, the electrical events include a spike and a later wave that resemble the QRS complex and T wave of the ECG. As in other excitable tissues, changes in the external K+ concentration affect the resting membrane potential of cardiac muscle, whereas changes in the external Na+ concentration affect the magnitude of the action potential. Initial rapid depolarization and the overshoot (phase 0) are due to opening of voltage-gated Na+ channels similar to that occurring in nerve and skeletal muscle. Initial rapid repolarization (phase 1) is due to closure of Na+ channels. The subsequent prolonged plateau (phase 2) is due to a slower but prolonged opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Final repolarization (phase 3) to the resting membrane potential (phase 4) is due to closure of the Ca2+ channels and K+ efflux through various types of K+ channels. Voltage-gated Na+ channel in cardiac muscle has two gates--an outer gate that opens at the start of depolarization at a membrane potential of -70 to -80 mV; and an inner gate that then closes and precludes further influx until the action potential ends (Na+ channel inactivation). Slow Ca2+ channel is activated at a membrane potential of-30 to -40 mV. There are three types of K+ channels that proc jce repolarization. The first produces a transient, early outward current (lTO) that produces an early incomplete repolarizai on. Second is inwardly rectifying, ie, at plateau potentials it allows K+ influx but resists K+ efflux, and only at lower membrane potentials does it permit K+ efflux. Current it produces is called lKr. The third type is a slowly activating (delayed rectifying) type that produces a current called IKs. The sum of IKr and IKs is a small net outward current that increases with time and produces repolarization",

        "question": "Which of the follow ing Physiological Function is mediated by Acetylcholine through Nicotinic receptors?",
        "exp": "(D) Contraction of skeletal muscle# Historically, Acetylcholine Receptors have been divided into two main types on the basis of their pharmacologic properties.> Muscarine, the alkaloid responsible for the toxicity of toadstools, has little effect on the receptors in autonomic ganglia but mimics the stimulatory action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle and glands. These actions of acetylcholine are therefore called muscarinic actions, and the receptors involved are muscarinic cholinergic receptors.> They are blocked by the drug atropine. In sympathetic ganglia, small amounts of acetylcholine stimulate postganglionic neurons and large amounts block transmission of impulses from pre- to postganglionic neurons. These actions are unaffected by atropine but mimicked by nicotine.> Consequently, these actions of acetylcholine are nicotinic actions and the receptors are nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Nicotinic receptors are subdivided into those found in muscle at neuromuscular junctions and those found in autonomic ganglia and the central nervous system. Both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are found in large numbers in the brain.> The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are members of a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that also includes the GABAA and glycine receptors and some of the glutamate receptors. They are made up of multiple subunits coded by different genes.> Each nicotinic cholinergic receptor is made up of five subunits that form a central channel which, when the receptor is activated, permits the passage of Na+ and other cations. The five subunits came from a menu of 16 known subunits, a1-a9, b2-b5, g, d, and e, coded by 16 different genes. Some of the receptors are homomeric, eg, those that contain five a7 subunits, but most are heteromeric.> The muscle type nicotinic receptor found in the fetus is made up of two a1 subunits, a b1 subunit, an a subunit, and a d subunit. In adult mammals, the d subunit is replaced by an z subunit, which decreases the channel open time but increases its conductance.> The nicotinic cholinergic receptors in autonomic ganglia are heteromers that usually contain a3 subunits in combination with others, and the nicotinic receptors in the brain are made up of many other subunits.> Many of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the brain are located presynaptically on glutamine-secreting axon terminals, and they facilitate the release of this transmitter. However, others are postsynaptic. Some are located on structures other than neurons, and some seem to be free in the interstitial fluid, ie, they are perisynaptic in location.> There is a binding site for acetylcholine on each a subunit, and when an acetylcholine molecule binds to each of them, they induce a configurational change in the protein so that the channel opens. This increases the conductance of Na+ and other cations, and the resulting influx of Na+ produces a depolarizing potential.> A prominent feature of neuronal nicotinic cholinergic receptors is their high permeability to Ca2+, suggesting their involvement in synaptic facilitation and learning.> Muscarinic cholinergic receptors are very different from nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Five types, encoded by five separate genes, have been cloned. The exact status of M5 is uncertain, but the remaining four all are serpentine receptors coupled via G proteins to adenylyl cyclase, K+ channels, or phospholipase C.> The nomenclature of these receptors has not been standardized, but the receptor designated M1 is abundant in the brain.> The M2 receptor is found in the heart. The M4 receptor is found in pancreatic acinar and islet tissue, where it mediates increased secretion of pancreatic enzymes and insulin. The M3 and M4 receptors are both found in smooth muscle.",

Teeth formed in children who drink water that contains small amounts of fluorine develop enamel that is more resistant to caries than the enamel in children who drink water that does not contain fluorine. Fluorine does not make the enamel harder than usual, but fluorine ions replace many of the hydroxyl ions in the hydroxyapatite crystals, which in turn makes the enamel several times less soluble. Fluorine may also be toxic to the bacteria. Finally, when small pits do develop in the enamel, fluorine is believed to promote deposition of calcium phosphate to \"heal\" the enamel surface. Regardless of the precise means by which fluorine protects the teeth, it is known that small amounts of fluorine deposited in enamel make teeth about three times as resistant to caries as teeth without fluorine.# Fluorine does not seem to be a necessary element for metabolism & it does not make the teeth themselves stronger but has a poorly understood effect in suppressing the cariogenic process.# Even though the mottled teeth are highly resistant to the development of caries, the structural strength of these teeth may be considerably lessened by the mottling process.",
