It may be associated with localized infection as well; the most common associated infection is a soft tissue infection such as necrotizing fasciitis. The mortality is high (up to 30%), usually secondary to shock and respiratory failure. The rapid progression of the disease and its high mortality demand early recognition and aggressive treatment.

Elsewhere, they are relatively rare. Enteric fevers are caused by infection with Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A and B. After a few days of bacteraemia, the bacilli localise, mainly in the lymphoid tissue of the small intestine, resulting in typical lesions in the Peyer's patches and follicles. These swell at first, then ulcerate and usually heal. After clinical recovery, about 5% of patients become chronic carriers (i.e. continue to excrete the bacteria after 1 year); the bacilli may live in the gallbladder for months or years and pass intermittently in the stool and, less commonly, in the urine. Clinical features Typhoid fever The incubation period is typically about 10-14 days but can be longer, and the onset may be insidious. The temperature rises in a stepladder fashion for 4 or 5 days with malaise, increasing headache, drowsiness and aching in the limbs. Constipation may be caused by swelling of lymphoid tissue around the ileocaecal junction, although in children diarrhoea and vomiting may be prominent early in the illness. The pulse is often slower than would be expected from the height of the temperature, i.e. a relative bradycardia. At the end of the first week, a rash may appear on the upper abdomen and on the back as sparse, slightly raised, rose-red spots, which fade on pressure. It is usually visible only on white skin. Cough and epistaxis occur. Around the 7th-10thday, the spleen becomes palpable. Constipation is followed by diarrhoea and abdominal distension with tenderness. Bronchitis and delirium may develop.

This is most severe with P. falciparum, which invades red cells of all ages but especially young cells; P. vivax and P. ovale invade reticulocytes, and P. malariae normoblasts, so that infections remain lighter. Anaemia may be profound and is worsened by dyserythropoiesis, splenomegaly and depletion of folate stores. In P. falciparum malaria, red cells containing trophozoites adhere to vascular endothelium in post-capillary venules in brain, kidney, liver, lungs and gut by the formation of 'knob' proteins. They also form 'rosettes' and rouleaux with uninfected red cells. Vessel congestion results in organ damage, which is exacerbated by rupture of schizonts, liberating toxic and antigenic substances . P. falciparum has influenced human evolution, with the appearance of protective mutations such as sickle-cell , thalassaemia , glucose-6-phosphatedehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and HLA-B53. P. falciparum does not grow well in red cells that contain haemoglobin F, C or especially S. Haemoglobin S heterozygotes (AS) are protected against the lethal complications of malaria. P. vivax cannot enter red cells that lack the Duffy blood group; therefore many West Africans and African Americans are protected. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1056",

        "exp": "The reversible aggregation of human red blood cells (RBC) continues to be of interest in the field of hemorheology because RBC aggregation is a major determinant of the in vitro rheological propeies of blood. Enhanced aggregation increases low shear blood viscosity and the degree of non-Newtonian behavior (1,2). In addition, the in vivo flow dynamics and flow resistance of blood are influenced by RBC aggregation (3), and marked increases of RBC aggregation have been observed in several diseases associated with vascular disorders (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypeension). Measures of RBC aggregation, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), are commonly used as diagnostic tests and as one index to the efficacy of therapy. For example, ESR is measured during drug therapy for rheumatoid ahritis, and has been shown to be normalized by improved glycemic control in diabetes (4). There is now general agreement regarding the correlations between elevated levels of fibrinogen or other large plasma proteins and enhanced RBC aggregation, and the effects of molecular mass and concentration for neutral polymers have been repoed (5). However, the specific mechanisms involved in RBC aggregation have not been fully elucidated, and thus it is not yet possible to fully understand the relations between pathology and altered RBC aggregation. RBC form multicell linear or branched aggregates in vitro when they are suspended in either plasma or solutions containing large polymers (e.g., dextran >=40 kDa); RBC aggregates also form in vivo in regions of low flow or stasis and, hence, in regions of low shear. These linear forms are often termed rouleaux because they resemble a stack of coins. It is impoant to note that RBC aggregation is a reversible process, with aggregates dispersed by mechanical or fluid flow forces and then reforming when the forces are removed. Conversely, RBC agglutination and blood coagulation are irreversible processes due to either protein polymerization or strong antigen-antibody attractive forces. RBC aggregation is primarily determined by the type and concentration of polymers in solution or the plasma level of large proteins and by RBC aggregability (i.e., the intrinsic cell characteristics affecting RBC aggregation) In blood, the protein fibrinogen is a primary determinant of blood viscosity due to its strong tendency to increase both plasma viscosity and RBC aggregation In the past, most repos have primarily examined the ability of plasma proteins to promote aggregation; for example, higher fibrinogen levels have been linked to elevated blood viscosities in hypeensive patients Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1079",

It is marketed under the trade name Fuzeon (Roche). Enfuviide works by disrupting the HIV-1 molecular machinery at the final stage of fusion with the target cell, preventing uninfected cells from becoming infected. A biomimetic peptide, enfuviide was designed to mimic components of the HIV-1 fusion machinery and displace them, preventing normal fusion. Drugs that disrupt fusion of virus and target cell are termed entry inhibitors or fusion inhibitors. HIV binds to the host CD4+ cell receptor the viral protein gp120; gp41, a viral transmembrane protein, then undergoes a conformational change that assists in the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell membrane. Enfuviide binds to gp41 preventing the creation of an entry pore for the capsid of the virus, keeping it out of the cell. Enfuviide is also an activator of the chemotactic factor receptor, formyl peptide receptor 1, and thereby activates phagocytes and presumably other cells bearing this receptor (see formyl peptide receptors). The physiological significance of this activation is unknown. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 979",

In the thick film, erythrocytes are lysed, releasing all blood stages of the parasite. This, as well as the fact that more blood is used in thick films, facilitates the diagnosis of low-level parasitaemia. A thin film is essential to confirm the diagnosis, species and, in P. falciparum infections, to quantify the parasite load (by counting the percentage of infected erythrocytes). P. falciparum parasites may be very scanty, especially in patients who have been paially treated. With P. falciparum, only ring forms are normally seen in the early stages; with the other species, all stages of the erythrocytic cycle may be found. Gametocytes appear after about 2 weeks, persist after treatment and are harmless, except that they are the source by which more mosquitoes become infected. Immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria antigens, such as OptiMAL (which detects the Plasmodium LDH of P. falciparum and vivax) and Parasight-F (which detects the P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2), are extremely sensitive and specific for falciparum malaria but less so for other species. They should be used in parallel with blood film examination but are especially useful where the microscopist is less experienced in examining blood films (e.g. in the UK). They are less sensitive for low-level parasitaemia and positivity may persist for a month or more in some individuals. The QBC Malaria Test is a fluorescence microscopy-based malaria diagnostic test that is also widely used. DNA detection (PCR) is used mainly in research and is useful for determining whether a patient has a recrudescence of the same malaria parasite or a reinfection with a new parasite.

KDT, Pharmacology, 6th ed., p 739)PRINCIPLES OF ANTI-TB CHEMOTHERAPY# Multiple drugs used in combination will reduce the possibility of selecting drug-resistant strains and hence chances of relapse. Among the first-line drugs, pyrazinamide, being active in an acidic environment, takes care of the persistent intracellular bacilli.# In general, regimens that are adequate for treating pulmonary TB are also effective for treating extrapulmonary TB. The problem lies in deciding on the appropriate duration of treatment. By WHO criteria, all caries spine cases should be treated for a minimum of 6 months.# For the purpose of rationalizing and initiating treatment, WHO categorizes TB patients into four categories depending upon clinical severity and priority.# Treatment in a category is divided into initial, intensive, and subsequent continuation phases.# The intensive phase comprises maximum number of drugs given daily (preferably under supervision) and is intended to bring about rapid clinical amelioration and achieve non-infectivity. Treatment is then continued with 2 or 3 drugs given daily or intermittently to eliminate residual bacilli and prevent relapse.# The initial intensive phase drugs may need to be maintained into the continuation phase. It is recommended that for infants and children with miliary TB or bone and joint TB treatment should last at least 12 months. For adults with these forms of extrapulmonary TB, the patient's response to therapy should be monitored closely. If response is slow or inadequate, treatment may be prolonged on a case-by-case basis.# Treatment in HIV-positive individuals:# The treatment regimens as outlined above are also effective in the presence of HIV infection. Unfortunately, complex interactions between rifampicin and antiretroviral drugs may force withdrawal of conventional regimens.

Adults in close contact with cases may develop disease. The incubation period is 48 hours and patients present with watery diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and abdominal pain. Dehydration is prominent. Diagnosis is aided by commercially available enzyme immunoassay kits, which require fresh or refrigerated stool samples. Immunity develops to natural infection. Monovalent and multivalent vaccines have been licensed in many countries and have now demonstrated efficacy in large trials in Africa and the Americas. The early diagnosis of human rotavirus infection is essential for effective patient management and infection control. We repo here a rapid, easy-to-perform, and inexpensive test for rotavirus detection. The viral RNA is extracted directly from the stools and electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels. Currently available immunoassays for routine diagnostic purposes are directed at the common group A-specific antigen. As repos become available on human gastroenteritis caused by the atypical or novel rotaviruses, this technique presents an added advantage in that it can detect both group A and non-group A rotaviruses.

        "question": "Which of the following is not seen with hepatitis C infection",
        "exp": "Hepatitis C virus causes both acute and chronic infection. New HCV infections are usually asymptomatic. Some persons get acute hepatitis which does not lead to a life-threatening disease. Around 30% (15-45%) of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection without any treatment. The remaining 70% (55-85%) of persons will develop chronic HCV infection. Of those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis ranges between 15% and 30% within 20 years. Transmission The hepatitis C virus is a bloodborne virus. It is most commonly transmitted through: injecting drug use through the sharing of injection equipment; the reuse or inadequate sterilization of medical equipment, especially syringes and needles in healthcare settings; the transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products; sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood (for example, among men who have sex with men, paicularly those with HIV infection or those taking pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV infection). HCV can also be transmitted sexually and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby; however, these modes of transmission are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, water or casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person. WHO estimates that in 2015, there were 1.75 million new HCV infections in the world (23.7 new HCV infections per 100 000 people). Symptoms The incubation period for hepatitis C ranges from 2 weeks to 6 months. Following initial infection, approximately 80% of people do not exhibit any symptoms. Those who are acutely symptomatic may exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes). Testing and diagnosis Because new HCV infections are usually asymptomatic, few people are diagnosed when the infection is recent. In those people who go on to develop chronic HCV infection, the infection is also often undiagnosed because it remains asymptomatic until decades after infection when symptoms develop secondary to serious liver damage. HCV infection is diagnosed in 2 steps: Testing for anti-HCV antibodies with a serological test identifies people who have been infected with the virus. If the test is positive for anti-HCV antibodies, a nucleic acid test for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) is needed to confirm chronic infection because about 30% of people infected with HCV spontaneously clear the infection by a strong immune response without the need for treatment. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies. After a person has been diagnosed with chronic HCV infection, they should have an assessment of the degree of liver damage (fibrosis and cirrhosis). This can be done by liver biopsy or through a variety of non-invasive tests. The degree of liver damage is used to guide treatment decisions and management of the disease Ref Harrison20th edition pg 997",

        "exp": "Reverse transcription is an error-prone process and multiple mutations arise with ongoing replication, which results in considerable viral genetic heterogeneity. Viral DNA is transpoed into the nucleus and integrated within the host cell genome by the integrase enzyme. Integrated virus is known as proviral DNA and persists for the life of the cell. Cells infected with proviral HIV DNA produce new virions only if they undergo cellular activation, resulting in the transcription of viral messenger RNA (mRNA) copies, which are then translated into viral peptide chains. The precursor polyproteins are then cleaved by the viral protease enzyme to form new viral structural proteins and enzymes that migrate to the cell surface and are assembled using the host cellular apparatus to produce infectious viral paicles; these bud from the cell surface, incorporating the host cell membrane into the viral envelope. The mature virion then infects other CD4 cells and the process is repeated. CD4 lymphocytes that are replicating HIV have a very sho survival time of about 1 day. It has been estimated that in asymptomatic HIV-infected people, more than 1010 virions are produced and 109 CD4 lymphocytes destroyed each day. The CD4 lymphocytes are destroyed primarily by the host immune response rather than by cytopathic effects of HIV. A small percentage of T-helper lymphocytes enter a post- integration latent phase. Latently infected cells are impoant as sanctuary sites from antiretroviral drugs, which act only on replicating virus. Current A is unable to eradicate HIV infection due to the persistence of proviral DNA in long-lived latent CD4 cells. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 978",

This capacity permits ongoing cycles of autoinfection as infective larvae are internally produced.# Life cycle- Humans acquire strongyloidiasis when filariform larvae in fecally contaminated soil penetrate the skin or mucous membranes.0- The larvae then travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, where they break into the alveolar spaces, ascend the bronchial tree, are swallowed, and thereby reach the small intestine.# Clinical Features- Recurrent urticaria, often involving the buttocks and wrists, is the most common cutaneous manifestation.- Migrating larvae can elicit a pathognomonic serpiginous eruption, larva currens (\"running larva\")--a pruritic, raised, erythematous lesion that advances as rapidly as 10 cm/h along the course of larval migration.- Adult parasites burrow into the duodenojejunal mucosa and can cause abdominal pain, which resembles peptic ulcer pain except that it is aggravated by food ingestion.0 It causes duodenal stricture.- Eosinophilia is common, with levels fluctuating over time.- Abrogation of host immunity (glucocorticoid therapy/immunosuppressive agents), leads to hyperinfection, with the generation of large numbers of filariform larvae.- Strongyloidiasis is a frequent complication of infection with human T cell lvmphotropic virus type I. but disseminated strongyloidiasis is not common among patients infected with HIV.# Diagnosis- In uncomplicated strongyloidiasis, the finding of rhabditiform larvae in feces is diagnostic.- The eggs are almost never detectable because they hatch in the intestine.- If stool examinations are negative, Strongyloides can be assayed by sampling of the duodenojejunal contents by aspiration or biopsy.6- ELISA for antibodies to excretory-secretory or somatic antigens of Strongyloides is a sensitive method.# Treatment- Even in the asymptomatic state, strongyloidiasis must be treated due to the potential for fatal hyperinfection. Ivermectin (Single 0.2 mg/kg dose yields highest cure rates) ) is more effective than albendazole (400 mg x3 days,repeated at 2 wks).- For disseminated strongyloidiasis, treatment with ivermectin should be extended for at least 5 to 7 days.Additional Educational Points:# STRING TEST to sample duodenal contents is sometimes necessary to detect Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides larvae.# Alternative tests for detection of Strongyloides larvae include duodenal aspirate or jejunal biopsy; serology; sputum or lung biopsy for filariform larvae in disseminated disease.# Some species, including Strongyloides stercoralis and Enterobius vermicularis, can be transmitted directly from person to person, while others, such as Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus, and Ancylostoma duodenale, require a soil phase for development.# Strongyloides stercoralis is a gastrointestinal parasitic infection that has a pattern of endemic distribution similar to that of HTLV-I.# Ivermectin is active at low doses against a wide range of helminths and ectoparasites. It is the drug of choice for the treatment of onchocerciasis, strongyloidiasis, cutaneous larva migrans, and scabies.PARASITIC NEMATODESFeatureAscaris lumbricoides (Roundworm)Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale (Hookworm)Strongyloides stercoralisTrichuris trichuria(whipworm) (pinworm)Enterobius vermicularisGlobal prevelance in humans (millions)1273127750902300Endemic areasWorld wideHot, humid regionsHot, humid regionsworldwideWorldwideInfective stageEggFilariform larvaFilariform larvaEggEggRoute of infectionOralPercutaneousPercuteneous or auto-infectionOralOralGastrointestinal location of wormsJejunal lumenJejunal mucosaSmall-bowel mucosaCecum, colonic mucosaCecum, appendixAdult worm size15-40 cm7-12 mm2 mm30-50 mm8-13 mm (female)Pulmonary passage of larvaeYesYesYesNoNoIncubation period (days) 60-7540-10017-2870-9035-45Longevity1yN.americanus: 2-5 yA. duodenale: 6-8 yDecades (owing to autoinfection)5y2 monthsFecundity (eggs/ day/ worm)240,000N.americanus 4000-10,000A.duodenale:50005000-10,0003000-70002000Principal symptomsRarely gastro- intestinal or biliary obstructionIron-deficiency anemia in heavy infectionGastrointestinal symptoms: malabsorption or sepsis in hyperinfectionGastrointestinal symptoms, anemiaPerianal pruritusDiagnostic stageEgg in stoolEgg in fresh stool, larva in old stoolLarvae in stool or duodenal aspirate; sputum in hyperinfectionEgg in stoolEggs from perianal skin on cellulose acetate tapeTreatmentMebendazoleAlbendazolePyrantel pamoateMebendazolePyrantel pamoateAlbendazole1.

        "exp": "Pathology and pathogenesis M. bovis infection arises mainly drinking non-sterilised milk from infected cows. M. tuberculosis is spread by the inhalation of aerosolised droplet nuclei from other infected patients. Once inhaled, the organisms lodge in the alveoli and initiate the recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes. Macrophages undergo transformation into epithelioid and Langhans cells, which aggregate with the lymphocytes to form the classical tuberculous granuloma . Numerous granulomas aggregate to form a primary lesion or 'Ghon focus' (a pale yellow, caseous nodule, usually a few millimetres to 1-2 cm in diameter), which is characteristically situated in the periphery of the lung. Spreadof organisms to the hilar lymph nodes is followed by a similar pathological reaction, and the combination of the primary lesion and regional lymph nodes is referred to as the 'primary complex of Ranke'. Reparative processes encase the primary complex in a fibrous capsule, limiting the spread of bacilli. If no fuher complications ensue, this lesion eventually calcifies and is clearly seen on a chest X-ray. Lymphatic or haematogenous spread may occur before immunity is established, however, seeding secondary foci in other organs, including lymph nodes, serous membranes, meninges, bones, liver, kidneys and lungs, which may lie dormant for years. The only clue that infection has occurred may be the appearance of a cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to tuberculin, demonstrated by tuberculin skin testing or an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA): so-called latent TB . If these reparative processes fail, primary progressive disease ensues . The estimated lifetime risk of developing disease after primary infection is 10%, with roughly half of this risk occurring in the first 2 years after infection. Glucocoicoids reduce inflammation and limit tissue damage; they are currently recommended when treating pericardial or meningeal disease, and in children with endobronchial disease. They may confer benefit in TB of the ureter, pleural effusions and extensive pulmonary disease, and can suppress hypersensitivity drug reactions. Surgery should be considered in cases complicated by massive haemoptysis, loculated empyema, constrictive pericarditis, lymph node suppuration, and spinal disease with cord compression, but usually only after a full p aregenosa,s aureus, Nocardia sps course of antituberculosis treatment.

Rickettsia spp. are classically divided into the typhus group and spotted fever group (SFG). Orientia spp, make up the scrub typhus group. The rickettsial pathogens most likely to be encountered during travel outside the United States include R. africae (African tick- bite fever), R. conorii (Mediterranean spotted fever), R. rickettsii (known as both Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Brazilian spotted fever), O. tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus), and R. typhi (murine or fleaborne typhus).TRANSMISSIONMost rickettsial pathogens are transmitted by ectoparasites such as fleas, lice, mites, and ticks. Organisms can be transmitted by bites from these ectoparasites or by inoculating infectious fluids or feces from the ectoparasites into the skin. Inhaling or inoculating conjunctiva with infectious material may also cause infection for some of these organisms. Transmission of some rickettsial diseases after transfusion or organ transplantation is rare but has been reported.EPEDIMIOLOGYEhrlichia, Neorickettsia, Neoehrlichia, and Anaplasma are not seen in Indian subcontinent.Rickettsial infections have been reported in India for several decades. During the World War II era, there were many deaths due to scrub typhus in this region. It was thought that these infections declined over time; however, several reports in the past decade indicate the presence of disease in various parts of India, such as the Himalayan region, the northeast, and the south.TREATMENTThe drug most commonly used is doxycycline or tetracycline, but Azithromycin or chloramphenicol is an alternative. As Rickettsial spp. Lack specific cell wall, so beta lactams and cephalosporins are not indicated in management of Rickettsial diseases.",

AIDS is no exceptio patients with AIDS develop lymphoma at some time during the course of their illness. This is a 120-fold increase in incidence compared with the comparison to the situation with KS, primary CNS lymphoma, and most opportunistic infections, the incidence of AIDS-associated systemic lymph experienced as dramatic a decrease as a consequence of the widespread use of effective cART. Locations that are most commonly involved with CNS lymphoma are deep in the white matter. The main diseases in the different cerebral toxoplasmosis and cerebral Chagas' disease.Three main categories of lymphoma are seen in patients with HIV infection: grade III or IV immunoblastic lymphoma,Burkitt's lymphoma, and pr lymphoma. Approximately 90% of these lymphomas are B cell in phenotype; more than half contain EBV DNA. Immunoblastic lymphomas account for >60% of the cases of lymphoma in patients with AIDS. The majority of these are diffuse large B cell lymp are generally high grade and would have been classified as diffuse histiocytic lymphomas in earlier classification schemes.Small noncleaved cell lymphoma (Burkitt's lymphoma) accounts for 20% of the cases of lymphoma in patients with AIDS. It is most frequent in years old and usually demonstrates characteristic c-myc translocations from chromosome 8 to chromosomes 14 or 22. Burkitt's lymphoma is not setting of immunodeficiency other than HIV-associated immunode- ficiency, and the incidence of this particular tumor is more than 1000-fold highe infection than in the general population.In contrast to African Burkitt's lymphoma, where 97% of the cases contain EBV genome, only 50% of HI lymphomas are EBV-positive.Primary CNS Ixmphoma accounts for 20% of the cases of lymphoma in patients with HIV infection. In contrast to HIV-asso Burkitt's lymph lymphomas are usually positive for EBV. In one study, the incidence of Epstein-Barr positivity was 100%. This malignancy does not have a predil particular age group. The median CD4+ T cell count at the time of diagnosis is 50/ L. Thus, CNS lymphoma generally presents at a later stage o does systemic lymphoma. This may explain, at least in part, the poorer prognosis for this subset of patients.",

In cystic form, it remains ble in water for up to 3 months and infection usually occurs by ingesting contaminated water. Its flagellar trophozoite form attaches to the duodenal and jejunal mucosa, causing inflammation. Clinical features and investigations After an incubation period of 1-3 weeks, there is diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weakness, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. Onexamination, there may be abdominal distension and tenderness.Chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption may occur, with bulky stools that float. Stools obtained at 2-3-day intervals should be examined for cysts. Duodenal or jejunal aspiration by endoscopy gives a higher diagnostic yield. The 'string test' may be used, in which one end of a piece of string is passed into the duodenum by swallowing and retrieved after an overnight fast; expressed fluid is then examined for the presence of G. lamblia trophozoites. A number of stool antigen detection tests are available. Jejunal biopsy specimens may show G. lamblia on the epithelial surface. Management Treatment is with a single dose of tinidazole 2 g, metronidazole 400 mg 3 times daily for 10 days, or nitazoxanide 500 mg orally twice daily for 3 days. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1154",

Nostric Warden Principles of Neurology, p. 224)PRIONS are Proteinaceous particles devoid of nucleic acid, that cause slowly evolving spongiform degeneration of central nervous system without production of immune response and due to abnormality of protein folding. Prion diseases are caused by the conversion of a normal (predominantly (3-helical) protein termed prion protein (PrPc) to a a-pleated form (PrPsc), which is transmissible. PrPsc resists protease degradation and facilitates the conversion of still more PrPc to PrPsc. Accumulation of PrPsc results in spongiform encephalopathy and dementia, ataxia, and death. It can be sporadic (Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease--rapidly progressive dementia), inherited (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome), or acquired (kuru).New concepts have emerged from studies of prions:(1) Prions are the only known infectious pathogens that are devoid of nucleic acid; all other infectious agents possess genomes composed of either RNA or DNA that direct the synthesis of their progeny.(2) Prion diseases may be manifest as infectious, genetic, and sporadic disorders; no other group of illnesses with a single etiology presents with such a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations.(3) Prion diseases result from the accumulation of PrPSc, the conformation of which differs substantially from that of its precursor, PrPC.(4) PrPSc can exist in a variety of different conformations, each of which seems to specify a particular disease phenotype.Master's Criteria for GD (1979)* NeuropaBiologically confirmed spongiform encqdialopathy in a patient of progressive demantia with any one of the following:* Myoclonus (90% cases)* Extrapyramidal signs (80% cases)* Pyramidal signs (55% cases)* EEG (triphasic electrical Bursts)* Cerebellar signs (30% cases)",

The newer definition is broader, stipulating three outpatient visits or 3 days in the hospital without elucidation of a cause or 1 week of \"intelligent and invasive\" ambulatory investigation.Nosocomial FUOa temperature of 38.3degC (lOTF) develops on several occasions in a hospitalized patient who is receiving acute care and in whom infection was not manifest or incubating on admission. Three days of investigation, including at least 2 days' incubation of cultures, is the minimum requirement for this diagnosis.Neutropenic FUODefined as a temperature of 38.3AdegC (101degF) on several occasions in a patient whose neutrophil count is <500/L or is expected to fall to that level in 1-2 days. The diagnosis of neutropenic FUO is invoked if a specific cause is not identified after 3 days of investigation, including at least 2 days' incubation of cultures.HIV-associated FUODefined by a temperature of 38.3AdegC (101degF) on several occasions over a period of >4 weeks for outpatients or >3 days for hospitalized patients with HIV infection. This diagnosis is invoked if appropriate investigations over 3 days, including 2 days' incubation of cultures, reveals no source.Causes of FUOInfections# Infections remain the most common cause of FUO.# Tumors have classically been the second most common cause of FUO in adults.# Tumors that present most often as FUO are hematologic malignancies, especially Hodgkin's disease and other lymphomas (Pel-Ebstein fevers--those that occur daily for days to weeks then disappear, only to reappear later in the same pattern--are now rarely seen), multiple myeloma and leukemias. Solid tumors like renal cell carcinoma is most often noted to cause FUO; much less commonly, hepatomas and cancer of the colon and gastrointestinal tract, lung, and breast, atrial myxomas, can cause FUO.Collagen vascular diseases, granulomatous diseases# Still's disease is the most frequent diagnosis in adults younger than 50 years; in older adults with FUO, temporal arteritis is the most common diagnosis. Other causes of FUO include polyarteritis nodosa, cryoglobulinemia, poly-myositis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and sarcoidosis.Other causes of FUO# Common entities, such as pulmonary emboli and hematomas, can manifest as FUO primarily.# Many different drugs can cause fever (table below), and hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis can also present as FUO.# Periodic fevers, such as familial Mediterranean fever, are rare and occur in select populations.# Factitious and fraudulent fevers--interesting diagnostic dilemmas that appear in every series of FUO--are uncommon.Commonly used medications that can cause fever of unknown originAntimicrobialsAnticonvulsantsAntihistaminesCardiovascular drugs H2-blockersMiscellaneousCarbapenemsCephalosporinsMinocycline HCINitrofurantoinPenicillinsRifampinSulfonamidesBarbituratesCarbamazepinePhenytoinHydralazineProcainamide HCIQuinidineCimetidineRanitidine HCIIodidesHerbal remediesNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsIbuprofenSulindacPhenothiazinesSalicylates",

        "exp": "Pulmonary aspergillosis is most likely to develop in people who have chronic lung disorders or damaged lungs. These people are likely to have abnormal spaces in their lungs where the fungus can grow. The fungus can also rarely infect sinuses and ear canals. The mold spores can colonize (grow) inside lung cavities that developed as a result of chronic diseases, such tuberculosis, emphysema, or advanced sarcoidosis. The fibers of fungus might form a lump by combining with white blood cells and blood clots. This lump or ball of fungus is called an aspergilloma or mycetoma. In some cases, a fungus ball may be present in other organs of the body. Invasive aspergillosis, the most severe type, occurs when the infection travels from the lungs into the bloodstream. Other organs, such as the kidneys, liver, skin or brain, may become infected. This is a very serious condition that may result in death if not treated. People with very weakened immune systems are more susceptible to invasive aspergillosis. Other risk factors include a low white blood cell count, long-term use of coicosteroids, or hospitalization. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an allergic reaction that happens to some people after exposure to Aspergillus fungus. The fungus causes inflammation in the lungs and air passages. ABPA is more common in people with cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and/or asthma because they tend to have more mucus in their airways. Although it is unclear exactly why the allergic reaction occurs, the mucus in their airways may provide a good environment for the mold to grow. Unfounately, the allergic reaction may produce symptoms similar to those associated with asthma, including wheezing, coughing and difficulty with breathing Aspergillosis is an infection or allergic reaction caused by various kinds of mold (a type of fungus). Mold is often found outdoors on plants, soil, or rotting vegetable matter. Mold can also grow indoors on household dust, food items such as ground spices, and building materials.

In addition to sandfly transmission, VL has also been repoed to follow blood transfusion, and disease can present unexpectedly in immunosuppressed patients - for example, after renal transplantation and in HIV infection. The majority of people infected remain asymptomatic. In visceral disease, the spleen, liver, bone marrow and lymph nodes are primarily involved. Clinical features In the Indian subcontinent, adults and children are equally affected; elsewhere, VL is mainly a disease of small children and infants, except in adults with HIV co-infection. The incubation period ranges from weeks to months (occasionally, several years). The first sign of infection is high fever, usually accompanied by rigor and chills. Fever intensity decreases over time and patients may become afebrile for intervening periods ranging from weeks to months. This is followed by a relapse of fever, often of lesser intensity. Splenomegaly develops quickly in the first few weeks and becomes massive as the disease progresses. Moderate hepatomegaly occurs later. Lymphadenopathy is common in Africa, the Mediterranean and South America but is rare in the Indian subcontinent. Blackish discoloration of the skin, from which the disease derived its name, kala-azar (the Hindi word for 'black fever'), is a feature of advanced illness but is now rarely seen. Pancytopenia is common. Moderate to severe anaemia develops rapidly and can cause cardiac failure. Thrombocytopenia, often compounded by hepatic dysfunction, may result in bleeding from the retina, gastrointestinal tract and nose. In advanced illness, hypoalbuminaemia may manifest as pedal oedema, ascites and anasarca (gross generalised oedema and swelling). As disease progresses, there is profound immunosuppression and secondary infections are very common. These include tuberculosis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, severe amoebic or bacillary dysentery, boils, cellulitis, chickenpox, shingles and scabies.

A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically pa of the initial evaluation.[Interferon-g release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing worldInterferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV. A definitive diagnosis of TB is made by identifying M. tuberculosis in a clinical sample (e.g., sputum, pus, or a tissue biopsy). However, the difficult culture process for this slow-growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or sputum culture. Thus, treatment is often begun before cultures are confirmed. Nucleic acid amplification tests and adenosine deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB. These tests, however, are not routinely recommended, as they rarely alter how a person is treated. Blood tests to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive, so they are not recommended Latent TB The Mantoux tuberculin skin test is often used to screen people at high risk for TB.Those who have been previously immunized with the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine may have a false-positive test result.The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis.Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test.These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results.However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii.IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1019",

In adults, the vaccines are immunogenic, but immunity appears to be relatively short-lived (with antibody levels above baseline for only 2-10 years), and booster doses do not induce a further rise in antibody concentration. The poor immunogenicity of plain polysaccharide vaccines in infancy has been overcome by chemical conjugation of the polysaccharides to a carrier protein (CRM 197, tetanus toxoid, or diphtheria toxoid). Conjugates that contain monovalent serogroup C polysaccharide and quadrivalent vaccines with A, C, Y, and W135 polysaccharides have been developed, as have vaccines including various other antigen combinations, conjugate vaccines overcome the hyporesponsiveness induced by plain polysaccharides by replenishing the memory pool. The reactogenicity of conjugate vaccines is similar to that of plain polysaccharide vaccines.The first quadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing A, C, Y, and W135 polysaccharides conjugated to diphtheria toxoid was initially recommended for all children >11 years of age. Adverse Events Reporting System indicated that there might be a short-term increase in the risk of Guillain-Barrie syndrome after immunization with the diphtheria conjugate vaccine.",

The temperature rises in a stepladder fashion for 4 or 5 days with malaise, increasing headache, drowsiness and aching in the limbs. Constipation may be caused by swelling of lymphoid tissue around the ileocaecal junction . In children diarrhoea and vomiting may be prominent early in the illness. The pulse is often slower than would be expected from the height of the temperature, i.e. a relative bradycardia. At the end of the first week, a rash may appear on the upper abdomen and on the back as sparse, slightly raised, rose-red spots, which fade on pressure. It is usually visible only on white skin. Cough and epistaxis occur. Around the 7th-10thday, the spleen becomes palpable. Constipation is followed by diarrhoea and abdominal distension with tenderness. Bronchitis and delirium may develop. If untreated, by the end of the second week the patient may be profoundly ill. Paratyphoid fever The course tends to be shoer and milder than that of typhoid fever and the onset is often more abrupt with acute enteritis. The rash may be more abundant and the intestinal complications less frequent. Complications Haemorrhage from, or a perforation of, the ulcerated Peyer's patches may occur at the end of the second week or during the third week of the illness. A drop in temperature to normal or subnormal levels may be falsely reassuring in patients with intestinal haemorrhage. Additional complications may involve almost any viscus or system because of the bacteraemia present during the first week. Bone and joint infection is common in children with sickle-cell disease. Investigations In the first week, diagnosis may be difficult because, in this invasive stage with bacteraemia, the symptoms are those of a generalised infection without localising features. Typically, there is a leucopenia. Blood culture establishes the diagnosis and multiple cultures increase the yield. Stool cultures are often positive in the second and third weeks. The Widal test detects antibodies to the O and H antigens but is not specific. Management Antibiotic therapy must be guided by in vitro sensitivity testing. Chloramphenicol (500 mg 4 times daily), ampicillin (750 mg 4 times daily) and co-trimoxazole (2 tablets or IV equivalent twice daily) are losing their effect due to resistance in many areas of the world, especially India and South-east Asia. Fluoroquinolones are the drugs of choice (e.g. ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily), if nalidixic acid screening predicts susceptibility, but resistance is common, especially in the Indian subcontinent and also in the UK.

As sensitization develops, a 1- to 1.5-cm area of gray-white inflammation with consolidation emerges, known as the Ghon focus.[?] Tubercle bacilli, either free or within phagocytes, drain to the regional nodes, which also often caseate. This combination of parenchymal lung lesion and nodal involvement is referred to as the Ghon complex.[?] In approximately 95% of cases, development of cell-mediated immunity controls the infection. Hence, the Ghon complex undergoes progressive fibrosis, often followed by radiologically detectable calcification (Ranke complex), and despite seeding of other organs, no lesions develop.",

Physical examination reverled five nodules of varying sizes with surrounding erythema and a central pore through which a single, moving larva was observed. This condition is caused by -",
        "exp": "The symptoms of this disease include: Severe pruritus Pain Inflammation and swelling Lesions and ulcerations, with black dots in the center Left untreated, secondary infections, such as bacteremia, tetanus, and gangrene, can occur. In all cases, tungiasis by itself only caused morbidity, though secondary infection may lead to moality. The life cycle section presents the Foaleza stages from the flea's developmental perspective. The discussion is specific to symptoms of human infection. The clinical presentation in humans follows the Foaleza Classification as the stage of infection will determine the symptoms present. The following discussion will give an overview of the symptoms beginning in stage 2 because patients are not likely to present themselves at the early stages of infection, mostly because the flea's burrowing is usually not felt. This may be due to a keratolytic enzyme secreted during stage 1. The patient with a single flea may present as early as stage 2 when, though the erythema is barely perceptible, a boring pain and the curious sensation of pleasant itching occur. This inflammatory reaction is the initial immunological response to the infestation. Heavily infested patients may not notice a stage 2 infection due to the other fleas' causing irritation as well. Feces may be seen, but this is more common in the 3rd stage.Around the third day after penetration, erythema and skin tenderness are felt, accompanied by pruritus (severe itching) and a black furuncular nodule surrounded by a white halo of stretched skin caused by the expansion of the flea. Fecal coils may protrude from the center of the nodule where the flea's anus is facing upward. They should be washed off quickly as the feces may remain in the skin unless removed. During this 3a substage, pain can be severe, especially at night or, if the nodule is on the foot, while walking. Eggs will also begin to be released and a watery secretion can be observed. The radical metamorphosis during the 3rd to 6th day after penetration, or neosomy, precedes the formation of a small caldera-like rim rampa as a result of the increased thickness of the flea's chitin exoskeleton. During the caldera formation, the nodule shrinks a bit and it looks as if it is beginning to dry out; this takes 2 weeks and comprises substage 3b. At the third week after penetration and substage 4a, the eggs' release will have stopped and the lesion will become smaller and more wrinkled. As the flea is near death, fecal and water secretion will stop altogether. Pain, tenderness, and skin inflammation will still be present. Around the 25th day after penetration, the lesion looks like a black crust and the flea's carcass is removed by host repair mechanisms and the skin begins to heal. With the flea gone, inflammation may still persist for a while. Although patients would not present within the 5th stage of tungiasis as the flea would be dead and no longer in the body, this stage is characterized by the reorganization of the skin (1-4 weeks) and a circular residue of 5-10 mm in diameter around the site in penetration. An intraepithelial abscess, which developed due to the presence of the flea, will drain and later heal. Although these disease residues would persist for a few months, tungiasis is no longer present. In severe cases, ulcers are common, as well as complete tissue and nail deformation. A patient may be unable to walk due to severe pain if too many of the lesions are present in the feet. Suppuration (pus formation), auto-amputation of digits ( ainhum), and chronic lymphedema may also be seen. If the patient is not vaccinated, tetanus is often a complication due to secondary infection. Gangrene is another common complication of severe infestation and superinfection. Staphylococcus aureus and Wolbachia endobacteria can be transmitted by the chigoe flea, as well as nearly 150 other different pathogens. For these reasons, the chigoe flea should be removed as soon as possible Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1078",

Successive crops appear over a 2- to 4-day period. Lesions can also be found on the mucosa of the pharynx and/or the vagina.* Younger children tend to have fewer vesicles than older individuals.* Secondary and tertiary cases within families are associated with a relatively large number of vesicles.* Immunocompromised patients--both children and adults, particularly those with leukemia--have lesions (often with a hemorrhagic base) that are more numerous and take longer to heal than those of immunocompetent patients.* Immunocompromised individuals are also at greater risk for visceral complications, which occur in 30-50% of cases and are fatal 15% of the time in the absence of antiviral therapy.",

HIV-2 is estimated to be more than 55% genetically distinct from HIV-1.1 The relatively uncommon HIV-2 virus is concentrated in West Africa but has been seen in other countries with links to West Africa. It is less infectious and progresses more slowly than HIV-1, resulting in fewer deaths. However, without treatment, most people living with HIV-2 will eventually progress to AIDS and die from the disease.2 3 While many commonly used antiretroviral drugs are active against HIV-2, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNIs) like nevirapine and eirenz do not work against it.

In cystic form, it remains ble in water for up to 3 months and infection usually occurs by ingesting contaminated water. Its flagellar trophozoite form attaches to the duodenal and jejunal mucosa, causing inflammation. Clinical features and investigations After an incubation period of 1-3 weeks, there is diarrhoea, mild steatorrhea abdominal pain, weakness, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. On examination, there may be abdominal distension and tenderness. Chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption may occur, with bulky stools that float. Stools obtained at 2-3-day intervals should be examined for cysts. Duodenal or jejunal aspiration by endoscopy gives a higher diagnostic yield. The 'string test' may be used, in which one end of a piece of string is passed into the duodenum by swallowing and retrieved after an overnight fast; expressed fluidis then examined for the presence of G. lamblia trophozoites. A number of stool antigen detection tests are available. Jejunal biopsy specimens may show G. lamblia on the epithelial surface.

        "exp": "Cholera Cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae serotype O1, is the archetypal toxin-mediated bacterial cause of acute watery diarrhoea. The enterotoxin activates adenylate cyclase in the intestinal epithelium, inducing net secretion of chloride and water. V. cholerae O1 has two biotypes, classical and El Tor, and each of these has two distinct serotypes, Inaba and Ogawa. Following its origin in the Ganges valley, devastating epidemics have occurred, often in association with large religious festivals, and pandemics have spread worldwide. The seventh pandemic, due to the El Tor biotype, began in 1961 and spread the Middle East to become endemic in Africa, subsequently spreading throughout South and Central America. Numbers of cases of cholera have been increasing, with outbreaks in Ghana in 2014 and Tanzaniain 2015. El Tor is more resistant to commonly used antimicrobials than classical Vibrio, and causes prolonged carriage in 5% infections. An atypical serotype, O139, has been responsible for localised outbreaks in Bangladesh. Infection spreads the stools or vomit of symptomatic patients or of the much larger number of subclinical cases. Organisms survive for up to 2 weeks in fresh water and 8 weeks in salt water. Transmission is normally through infected drinking water, shellfish and food contaminated by flies, or on the hands of carriers. Clinical features Severe diarrhoea without pain or colic begins suddenly and is followed by vomiting. Following the evacuation of normal gut faecal contents, typical 'rice water' material is passed, consisting of clear fluid with flecks of mucus. Classical cholera produces enormous loss of fluid and electrolytes, leading to intense dehydration with muscular cramps. Shock and oliguria develop but mental clarity remains. Death from acute circulatory failure may occur rapidly unless fluid and electrolytes are replaced. Improvement is rapid with proper treatment. The majority of infections, however, cause mild illness with slight diarrhoea. Occasionally, a very intense illness, 'cholera sicca', occurs, with loss of fluid into dilated bowel, killing the patient before typical gastrointestinal symptoms appear. The disease is more dangerous in children. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1132",

Some staphylococci produce coagulase, an enzyme that conves fibrinogen to fibrin in rabbit plasma, causing it to clot. Staph. aureus is coagulase-positive, and most other species are coagulase-negative. In modern laboratory practice, however, the identification of Staph. aureus rarely involves the coagulase test. Staph. aureus is the main cause of staphylococcal infections. Staph. intermedius is another coagulase-positive staphylococcus, which causes infection following dog bites. Among coagulase- negative organisms, Staph. epidermidis is the predominant commensal organism of the skin, and can cause severe infections in those with central venous catheters or implanted prosthetic materials. Staph. saprophyticus is pa of the normal vaginal flora and causes urinary tract infections in sexually active young women. Others implicated in human infections include Staph. lugdunensis, Staph. schleiferi, Staph. haemolyticus and Staph. caprae. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are not usually identified to species level. Staphylococci are paicularly dangerous if they gain access to the blood stream, having the potential to disseminate widely . In any patient with staphylococcal bacteraemia, especially injection drug-users, the possibility of endocarditis must be considered . Growth of Staph. aureus in blood cultures should not be dismissed as a 'contaminant' unless all possible underlying sources have been excluded and repeated blood culture is negative. Any evidence of spreading cellulitis indicates the urgent need for an antistaphylococcal antibiotic, such as flucloxacillin (unless there is a likely risk of MRSA). This is paicularly true for mid-facial cellulitis, which can result in cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis. In addition, Staph. aureus can cause severe systemic disease due to the effects of toxin produced at superficial sites in the absence of tissue invasion by bacteria. Skin infections Staphylococcal infections cause ecthyma, folliculitis, furuncles, carbuncles, bullous impetigo and the scalded skin syndrome . They may also be involved in necrotising infections of the skin and subcutaneous tissues . Wound infections Many wound infections are caused by staphylococci, which may significantly prolong post-operative hospital stays Prevention involves careful attention to hand hygiene, skin preparation and aseptic technique, and the use of topical and systemic antibiotic prophylaxis. Treatment is by drainage of any abscesses plus adequate dosage of antistaphylococcal antibiotics, done early, paicularly if prosthetic implants have been inseed.

Manifestations include oropharyngeal and vaginal candidiasis ('thrush'), interigo and chronic paronychia. Superficial candidiasis often follows antibiotic therapy. Interigo is characterised by inflammation in skin folds with surrounding'satellite lesions'. Chronic paronychia is associated with frequent wetting of the hands. Superficial candidiasis is treated mainly with topical azoles , oral azoles being reserved for refractory or recurrent disease. Severe oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis is a consequence of CD4+ T-lymphocyte depletion/ dysfunction, as in HIV infection . Recurrent vaginal or penile candidiasis may be a manifestation of diabetes mellitus. Rarely, mutations in the autoimmune regulator gene (AIRE) or signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) cause a syndrome of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis . This is characterised by Candida infections of skin, mucosa and nails, with hyperkeratotic nails and erythematous periungual skin. Patients have cell-mediated immune defects against Candida and may have polyendocrinopathy and autoimmune features. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1127",

Impetigo is a cellulitis caused by group A-hemolytic streptococci. It often involves the face and can occur after an abrasion of the skin. Its distribution is not dermatomal, and it rarely causes severe pain. Chickenpox produces vesicles in various stages of development that are diffuse and produce more pruritus than pain.

Other chronic complications include uveitis, orchitis, and nasal septal perforation. Patients with leprosy may also present with acute lepra reactions that are characterized by painful skin lesions and neuritis. The diagnosis is usually confirmed with the help of a biopsy.

It paicularly affects children, tourists and immunosuppressed individuals, and is the parasite most commonly impoed into the UK. In cystic form, it remains ble in water for up to 3 months and infection usually occurs by ingesting contaminated water. Its flagellar trophozoite form attaches to the duodenal and jejunal mucosa, causing inflammation. Clinical features and investigations After an incubation period of 1-3 weeks, there is diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weakness, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. On examination, there may be abdominal distension and tenderness. Chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption may occur, with bulky stools that float. Stools obtained at 2-3-day intervals should be examined for cysts. Duodenal or jejunal aspiration by endoscopy gives a higher diagnostic yield. The 'string test' may be used, in which one end of a piece of string is passed into the duodenum by swallowing and retrieved after an overnight fast; expressed fluid is then examined for the presence of G. lamblia trophozoites. A number of stool antigen detection tests are available. Jejunal biopsy specimens may show G. lamblia on the epithelial surface.

        "exp": "A in special situations (Pregnancy) Nevirapine is the drug that prevents mother to child transmission . All pregnant women should have HIV testing at an early stage in pregnancy. The CD4 count falls by about 25% during pregnancy due to haemodilution. The course of HIV disease progression is not altered by pregnancy. In the pre-A era, the rate of mother-to-child transmission was 15-40%, with rates being influenced by several factors .A has dramatically reduced the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV to less than 1%. All pregnant women should sta A at the beginning of the second trimester, unless they have advanced disease, when A should be staed in the first trimester. Caesarean section is associated with a lower risk of mother- to-child transmission than vaginal delivery, but the mode of delivery does not affect transmission risk if the viral load is suppressed on A. HIV is also transmitted by breastfeeding. In high-income countries, exclusive formula feeding is generally recommended. In resource-poor settings, however, formula feeding is associated with a risk of infant morbidity and moality, which may negate the benefit of not transmitting HIV to the infant. There is minimal risk of transmitting HIV by breastfeeding in women with a suppressed viral load on A. Fuhermore, providing antiretrovirals to infants (usually nevirapine monotherapy) while they are breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of transmission. Breastfeeding is therefore now encouraged in resource-poor settings. Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months, as mixed feeding (with formula or solids) is associated with a higher risk of transmission. Diagnosis of HIV in infancy requires the detection of HIV RNA by PCR, as maternal antibodies to HIV, which persist for up to 15 months, will give a false-positive result on antibody assays. PCR should ideally be carried out within 6 weeks of bih to facilitate early A initiation. If the baby is breastfed, the PCR should be repeated 2 weeks after weaning.

This is then examined on a glass slide under the microscope. A perianal swab, moistened with saline, also allows diagnosis. Management A single dose of mebendazole (100 mg), albendazole (400 mg), pyrantel pamoate (11 mg/kg) or piperazine (4 g) treats infection and is repeated after 2 weeks to control auto-reinfection. If infection recurs in a family, each member should be treated. All nightclothes and bed linen are laundered during treatment. Fingernails must be kept sho and hands washed carefully before meals.

(Ref H- 17th/chapter 198)Mucormycosis: Rx# Three factors are key to a successful outcome of therapy for mucormycosis:- (1) Reversal of the underlying predisposition;- (2) Aggressive surgical debridement; and- (3) Aggressive antifungal therapy, with early initiation and high drug doses.# Traditionally, high-dose conventional Amphotericin B has been used for the Rx of mucormycosis, but doses have been limited to <1.5 mg/kg per day because of the nearly universal development of nephrotoxicity.# Use of lipid formulations at doses of 15-20 mg/kg per day (AmBisome) or 15 mg/kg per day (Abelcet) maximizes the amount of amphotericin B delivered to the tissues as well as the speed of its delivery. At these doses, nephrotoxicity occurs in <50% of patients.# The optimal duration of therapy for mucormycosis is not known precisely. If possible, antifungal administration should be continued for at least 3 months after- (1) all clinical abnormalities resolve or stabilize, leaving no clinical evidence of infection at the involved site(s); and (2) scans, x-rays, and laboratory studies yield normal or stable results. Careful follow-up should continue for at least 1 year to confirm that there is no evidence of recurrent infection.Additional Educational points:Harrison's Internal Medicine 17th / Chapter 191.......Voriconazole# Like fluconazole, voriconazole is available in both oral and IV formulations.# Voriconazole has a broader spectrum than fluconazole against- Candida species (including C. glabrata and C. krusei) and- is active against Aspergillus, Scedosporium, and Fusarium.# It is generally considered the first-line drug of choice for Rx of aspergillosis. Q# This agent is not recommended for Rx of the endemic mycoses.# Among the disadvantages of voriconazole (compared with fluconazole) are its more numerous interactions with many of the drugs used in patients predisposed to fungal infections.# Hepatotoxicity, skin rashes (including photosensitivity), and visual disturbances are common.# Moreover, it is advisable to monitor voriconazole levels in certain patients since:- (1) this drug is completely metabolized in the liver by CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19; and- (2) human genetic variability in CYP2C19 activity exists.# Dosages should be reduced accordingly in those patients with liver failure.# Dose adjustments for renal insufficiency are not necessary; however, because the IV formulation is prepared in cyclodextrin, it should not be given in severe renal insufficiency.Posaconazole# Posaconazole is approved by the FDA for prophylaxis of aspergillosis and candidiasis in patients at high risk for developing these infections because of severe immunocompromise.# This drug has also been evaluated for the Rx of zygomycosis, fusariosis, aspergillosis, and oropharyngeal candidiasis.# The relevant studies of posaconazole in zygomycosis, fusariosis, and aspergillosis have examined salvage therapy.# A study of >90 patients whose zygomycosis was refractory to other therapy yielded encouraging results.# No trials of posaconazole for the Rx of candidemia have yet been reported.# Case reports have described the drug's efficacy in coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis.# In addition, posaconazole has been found to be effective against fluconazole-resistant Candida species.# The results study of the use of posaconazole as salvage therapy for aspergillosis have been promising.Itraconazole# Itraconazole is available in IV and oral formulations.# Varying blood levels among patients taking oral itraconazole reflect a disadvantage compared with the other azoles.# Itraconazole is the drug of choice for -- mild to moderate histoplasmosis and blastomycosis and- has often been used for chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.# It has been approved by the U.S. FDA for use in febrile neutropenic patients.# Itraconazole has also proven useful for the Rx of:- Chronic coccidioidomycosis,- Sporotrichosis, and- S. apiospermum infection.# The mucocutaneous and cutaneous fungal infections that have been treated successfully with itraconazole include oropharyngeal candidiasis (especially in AIDS patients), tinea versicolor, tinea capitis, and onychomycosis.# Disadvantages of itraconazole include:- its poor penetration into the CSF,- the use of cyclodextrin in both the oral suspension and the IV preparation,- Cases of severe CHF in patients taking itraconazole have been a source of concern.- Like the other azoles, itraconazole can cause hepatic toxicity.Echinocandins# The echinocandins, including the approved drugs caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin, have added considerably to the antifungal armamentarium. All three of these agents inhibit -1,3-glucan synthase, which is necessary for cell wall synthesis in fungi and is not a component of human cells. None of these agents is available in an oral formulation. The echinocandins are considered fungicidal for Candida and fungistatic for Aspergillus.# Their greatest use to date is against candidal infections,# They offer two advantages:- broad-spectrum activity against all Candida species and- relatively low toxicity.# The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all the echinocandins are highest against C. parapsilosis; it is not clear whether these higher MIC values represent less clinical effectiveness against this species. The echinocandins are among the safest antifungal agents.# In controlled trials, caspofungin has been at least as efficacious as AmB for the Rx of candidemia and invasive candidiasis and as efficacious as fluconazole for the Rx of candidal esophagitis. In addition, caspofungin has been efficacious as salvage therapy for aspergillosis. At present, it is used most extensively for the Rx of candidemic patients, especially before the infecting species is precisely identified.# Anidulafungin has been approved by the FDA as therapy for candidemia in nonneutropenic patients and for Candida esophagitis, intraabdominal infection, and peritonitis.When anidulafungin is used with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or voriconazole, no dosage adjustment is required for either drug in the combination.# Micafungin has been approved for the Rx of esophageal candidiasis and for prophylaxis in patients receiving stem cell transplants. When micafungin is given with sirolimus, the AUC rises for sirolimus, usually necessitating a reduction in its dose.

Infection follows ingestion of eah or food contaminated with ova, which have become infective after lying for 3 weeks or more in moist soil. The adult worm is 3-5 cm long and has a coiled anterior end resembling a whip. Whipworms inhabit the caecum, lower ileum, appendix, colon and anal canal. There are usually no symptoms, but intense infections in children may cause persistent diarrhoea or rectal prolapse, and growth retardation. The diagnosis is readily made by identifying ova in faeces. Treatment is with mebendazole in doses of 100 mg twice daily or albendazole 400 mg daily for 3 days for patients with light infections, and for 5-7 days for those with heavy infections. Tissue-dwelling human nematodes Filarial worms are tissue-dwelling nematodes. The larval stages are inoculated by biting mosquitoes or flies, each specific to a paicular filarial species. The larvae develop into adult worms (2-50 cm long), which, after mating, produce millions of microfilariae (170-320 um long) that migrate in blood or skin. The life cycle is completed when the vector takes up microfilariae by biting humans. In the insect, ingested microfilariae develop into infective larvae for inoculation in humans, normally the only host. Disease is due to the host's immune response to the worms (both adult and microfilariae), paicularly dying worms, and its pattern and severity vary with the site and stage of each species . The worms are long-lived: microfilariae survive 2-3 years and adult worms 10-15 years. The infections are chronic and worst in individuals constantly reinfected. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1023",

The IFA procedure can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine if a patient has been infected with Plasmodium. Because of the time required for development of antibody and also the persistence of antibodies, serologic testing is not practical for routine diagnosis of acute malaria. However, antibody detection may be useful for: screening blood donors involved in cases of transfusion-induced malaria when the donor's parasitemia may be below the detectable level of blood film examination testing a patient with a febrile illness who is suspected of having malaria and from whom repeated blood smears are negative testing a patient who has been recently treated for malaria but in whom the diagnosis is questioned Species-specific testing is available for the four human species: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. Cross reactions often occur between Plasmodium species and Babesia species. Blood stage Plasmodium species schizonts (meronts) are used as antigen. The patient's serum is exposed to the organisms; homologous antibody, if present, attaches to the antigen, forming an antigen-antibody (Ag-Ab) complex. Fluorescein-labeled antihuman antibody is then added, which attaches to the patient's malaria-specific antibodies. When examined with a fluorescence microscope, a positive reaction is when the parasites fluoresce an apple green color. Enzyme immunoassays have also been employed as a tool to screen blood donors, but are not recommended for clinical diagnosis due to limited sensitivity. Ref Harrison20th edition pg. 1011",

Harrison 18th/ ch. 210)# After entry into the bloodstream, merozoites rapidly invade erythrocytes and become trophozoites.# Attachment is mediated via a specific erythrocyte surface receptor.# In the case of P. vivax, this receptor is related to the Duffy blood-group antigen Fya or Fyb.# Most West Africans and people with origins in that region carry the Duffy-negative FyFy phenotype and are therefore resistant to P. vivax malaria.ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS OF MALARIA# Four species of the genus Plasmodium cause nearly all malarial infections in humans (although rare infections involve species normally affecting other primates). These are:- P. falciparum,- P. vivax,- P ovale, and- P malariae.# Almost all deaths are caused by falciparum malaria. Human infection begins when a female anopheline mosquito inoculates plasmodial sporozoites from its salivary gland during a blood meal.# By amplification process (known as intrahepatic or preerythrocytic schizogony or merogony), a single sporozoite eventually may produce 10,000 to >30,000 daughter merozoites.# The swollen liver cell eventually bursts, discharging motile merozoites into the bloodstream.# These then invade the RBCs and multiply 6- to 20-fold every 48 to 72 h.# When the parasites reach densities of ~50/mL of blood, the symptomatic stage of the infection begins.# The dormant forms, or hypnozoites, are the cause of the relapses that characterize infection with P. vivax and P. ovale,# By the end of the 48-h intraerythrocytic life cycle (72 h for P. malariae), the parasite has consumed nearly all the hemoglobin and grown to occupy most of the RBC. It is now called a schizont.# Multiple nuclear divisions have taken place (shizogony or merogony), and the RBC ruptures to release 6 to 30 daughter merozoites, each potentially capable of invading a new RBC and repeating the cycle.# When a female Anopheline mosquito takes a blood meal, the male and female gametocytes continue their sexual development.# Schizonts are rarely seen in the peripheral blood and their presence may indicate a potentially serious parasitemia.",

In cystic form, it remains ble in water for up to 3 months and infection usually occurs by ingesting contaminated water. Its flagellar trophozoite form attaches to the duodenal and jejunal mucosa, causing inflammation. Clinical features and investigations After an incubation period of 1-3 weeks, there is diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weakness, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. On examination, there may be abdominal distension and tenderness. Chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption may occur, with bulky stools that float.Stools obtained at 2-3-day intervals should be examined for cysts. Duodenal or jejunal aspiration by endoscopy gives a higher diagnostic yield. The 'string test' may be used, in which one end of a piece of string is passed into the duodenum by swallowing and retrieved after an overnight fast; expressed fluid is then examined for the presence of G. lamblia trophozoites. A number of stool antigen detection tests are available. Jejunal biopsy specimens may show G. lamblia on the epithelial surface.

The ease of production of B. anthracis spores makes this infection a candidate for biological warfare or bioterrorism. B. anthracis produces a number of toxins that mediate the clinical features of disease. The simple polychrome methylene blue (PMB) staining procedure for blood or tissue smears from dead animals (M'Fadyean reaction) established in 1903 remained accepted as a highly reliable, rapid diagnostic test for anthrax for six decades while that disease was still common in livestock throughout the world. Improvements in disease control led to anthrax becoming rare in industrialized countries and less frequent in developing countries with the result that quality controlled, commercially produced PMB became hard to obtain by the 1980s. Mixed results with alternative methylene blue-based stains then led to diagnosis failures, confusion among practitioners and mistrust of this procedure as a reliable test for anthrax. We now repo that, for laboratories needing a reliable M'Fadyean stain at sho notice, the best approach is to have available commercially pure azure B ready to constitute into a solution of 0.03 g azure B in 3 ml of 95% ethanol or methanol to which is then added 10 ml of 0.01% KOH (0.23% final azure B concentration) and which can then be used immediately and through to the end of the tests. Stored in the dark at room temperature, the shelf life is at least 12 months. Smears should be fixed with ethanol or methanol (95-100%), not by heat, and the stain left for 5 min before washing off for optimum effect. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1078",

It is given either by mouth or by injection into a vein. Fluconazole is a first-generation triazole antifungal medication. It differs from earlier azole antifungals (such as ketoconazole) in that its structure contains a triazole ring instead of an imidazole ring. While the imidazole antifungals are mainly used topically, fluconazole and ceain other triazole antifungals are preferred when systemic treatment is required because of their improved safety and predictable absorption when administered orally. Fluconazole's spectrum of activity includes most Candida species (but not Candida krusei or Candida glabrata), Cryptococcus neoformans, some dimorphic fungi, and dermatophytes, among others.

Macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and fibroblasts aggregate to form granulomas, with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages. When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage, they fuse together to form a giant multinucleated cell in the alveolar lumen. The granuloma may prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system.However, more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the granulomas to avoid destruction by the host's immune system. Macrophages and dendritic cells in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes; thus the immune response is suppressed. Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant, resulting in latent infection. Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death (necrosis) in the center of tubercles. To the naked eye, this has the texture of soft, white cheese and is termed caseous necrosis. TB bacteria gain entry to the blood stream from an area of damaged tissue, they can spread throughout the body and set up many foci of infection, all appearing as tiny, white tubercles in the tissuesThis severe form of TB disease, most common in young children and those with HIV, is called miliary tuberculosis.People with this disseminated TB have a high fatality rate even with treatment (about 30%). In many people, the infection waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis.Affected tissue is replaced by scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the air passages (bronchi) and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria, and thus can spread the infection. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1079",
