The severity of patient's condition depends on the extent of nervous system involvement-that is, the extent of demyelination. Cranial nerve involvement is present in 85% of cases, with the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) most often affected. The glossopharyngeal (cranial nerve IX), vagus (cranial nerve X), spinal accessory (cranial nerve XI), and hypoglossal (cranial nerve XII) nerves also may be affected. Signs and symptoms of facial nerve dysfunction include inability to smile, frown, whistle, or use a straw when drinking. Paralysis of cranial nerves IX and X can cause dysphagia and laryngeal paralysis. Autonomic dysfunction may occur if the vagus nerve is affected. Motor weakness and paralysis usually begin in the legs, progressing to the trunk and arms. If sensory symptoms are present, patients may complain of paresthesias and pain. After the first few days of weakness and paresthesias, physical assessment will reveal diminished (hyporeflexia) or absent deep tendon reflexes (areflexia) in the involved extremities. Areflexia is considered a key assessment finding in GBS. Respiratory failure is thought to be caused by involvement of the muscles of respiration, including the diaphragm and the intercostals. GBS doesn't affect the patient's cognitive function, level of consciousness, or pupillary signs. Autonomic dysfunction-signs and symptoms include cardiac dysrhythmias, paroxysmal hypotension, ohostatic hypotension, paralytic ileus, urinary retention, and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.",

Water deprivation test is used to establish the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and to differentiate Central and Nephrogenic forms of Diabetes Insipidus. Patients with diabetes insipidus have a normal or increased plasma osmolality (> 280 mosm/l) and decreased urine osmolality (<300mosm/1). 'Water deprivation test' typically demonstrates an increase in plasma osmolality with failure of urinary osmolality to increase (no change) during H20 deprivation in cases of diabetes insipidus thereby suggesting the diagnosis. Diabetes Insipidus is associated with plasma osmolality > 280 mosm/kg and urinary osmolalitv < 300 mosm /kg In normal subjects the plasma osmolality ranges from 275-295 mosm /kg while the range of urine osmolality is wide, from 40 to 1000 mosm/kg depending on the state of hydration. After water deprivation the urine osmolality will normally rise to exceed 800 mosm/kg while the plasma osmolality remains below 295 mosm/kg (U/P >2) In Diabetes Insipidus subjects the plasma osmolality ranges from normal to high (>275 mosm/kg) while the urine osmolality is typically < 300 mosm/1. After water deprivation plasma osmolality rises to > 295 mosm/kg while urinary osmolality fails to rise appropriately (Fails to rise to >300 mosm/kg) (U/P Ratio < 2.0) Water deprivation test is often required to establish a diagnosis of Diabetes insipidus Water deprivation test is indicated in patients with hypotonic polyuria (Uosm < 300 mosm/kg) and a plasma osmolality 410 within the normal range (Posm = 275 -- 295 mosm/kg) to establish the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and differentiate central & nephrogenic forms.",

This facilitates its subsequent use in the placement of large needles (typically 15 Gauge) to access the circulation. Fistulas have the highest long-term patency rate of all dialysis access options. The most impoant complication of aeriovenous grafts is thrombosis of the graft and graft failure, due principally to intimal hyperplasia at the anastomosis between the graft and recipient vein.

In cases of isolated oculomotor palsy, the subarachnoid space is the most likely site of pathology. The differential includes a posterior communicating aery aneurysm, uncal herniation, compressive neoplasms, inflammatory lesions, or trauma. Causes for third-nerve palsy within the cavernous sinus include neoplasms, carotid aery aneurysm, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and carotid-cavernous fistula. Orbital lesions causing third-nerve palsies may be due to inflammation, trauma, neoplasms, and mucoceles. Isolated third-nerve palsy is common with diabetic or hypeensive disease, likely due to microvascular ischemia. In this situation, the palsy rarely affects the pupil, and may be extremely painful.

Contrast agents and other iodine-containing substances should be avoided because of the risk of inducing the Jod-Basedow effect, characterized by enhanced thyroid hormone production by autonomous nodules. Usual causes: An iodide load can induce hypehyroidism (Jod-Basedow effect) in some patients with multinodular goiter, latent Graves disease, and rarely in individuals with thyroid glands that appear otherwise normal. Although they appear normal, there is usually an underlying thyroiditis. Jod-Basedow effect does not occur in persons with normal thyroid glands, as thyroid hormone synthesis and release in normal persons is controlled by pituitary TSH secretion, which does not allow hypehyroidism when extra iodine is ingested.

IgG subclass 2 is directed against polysaccharide antigens and is involved in the host defense against encapsulated bacteria. C3 nephritic factor is an IgG autoantibody that binds to C3 convease, making it resistant to inactivation. This leads to persistently low serum complement levels and is associated with Type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. C5 is a component of the complement system. C5a is an anaphylatoxin that affects vasodilatation in acute inflammation. It is also chemotactic for neutrophils and monocytes and increases the expression of adhesion molecules. A deficiency of C5a would affect the acute inflammatory response against any microorganism or foreign substance. Myeloperoxidase in phagocytic cells is an element of the oxygen-dependent pathway present in phagocytic cells that effectively kills bacterial cells. The hydrogen peroxide-halide complex is considered the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils. Chronic granulomatous disease is associated with a deficiency of NADPH oxidase, which conves molecular oxygen to superoxide (the first step in the myeloperoxidase system).

It is usually sporadic with a 2:1 female to male preponderance. Thyroid dysgenesis is the commonest cause of permanent CH (80-85%). Thyroid hormone synthetic defects account for 10% of all cases. These are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders. The defect can lie in iodide trapping or organification, iodotyrosine coupling or deiodination and thyroglobulin synthesis or secretion. The commonest of these is a defect in the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activity leading to impaired oxidation and organification of iodide to iodine. These disorders usually result in goitrous hypothyroidism. Majority of infants appear normal at bih. Ideally universal screening at 3-4 days of age should be done for detecting CH. Abnormal values on screening (T4 < 6.5 ug/dL, TSH >20mu/L) should be confirmed by a venous sample before initiating treatment. Term as well as preterm infants with low T4 and elevated TSH should be staed on L-thyroxine at a dose of 10-15ig/ kg/ day as soon as the diagnosis is made. Regular monitoring should be done to ensure that T4 is in the upper half of normal range. The outcome of CH depends on the time of initiation of therapy and the dose of L-thyroxine used'",

An antiproliferative agent (azathioprine); and 3. A coicosteroid (prednisolone) However, a small number of treatment centers use a policy of initial monotherapy with a calcineurin inhibitor, adding in other agents if necessary. Immunosuppressive therapy for renal transplantation in adults Induction therapy Is a course of intensive immunosuppressive for about 2 weeks immediately post operatively (though often staed immediately pre-operatively) with the aim of 'switching off' the immune system after transplantation to reduce the likelihood of accelerated rejection and acute rejection. It has also been used as a means of reducing exposure to calcineurin inhibitors in the early stages after transplantation when the graft may be paicularly vulnerable to their nephrotoxic effects. The term induction therapy has usually been linked with the use of the following agents: - The polyclonal antibodies antithymocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) - The antilymphocyte immunoglobulin (ALG), and - The monoclonal antibody muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) Initial therapy Is the treatment given to all recipients (except where the donor is an identical twin) for 0-3 months after transplantation. Initial therapy is usually 'triple therapy', in which a clacineurin inhibitor (traditionally cyclosporine) is used as the 'primary agent' in combination with a coicosteroid (prednisolone) and azathioprine. Occasionally, dual therapy (cyclosporine plus costicositeroid) is used. Maintenance therapy Is the treatment that patients receive long-term, throughout the duration of allograft survival Maintenance therapy is often identical to initial therapy (triple therapy) but at a reduced dosage because the transplanted kidney becomes immunologically more stable with increasing time. However, agents used in maintenance therapy may be altered in response to - Development of acute rejection, severe infections or toxicity. - Poor tolerability leading to non-adherence",

The treatment for this is a segmentectomy a thoracotomy. More and more, these lesions are diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. Symptoms can vary greatly, but they include a persistent dry cough.

        "exp": "Ans. A: First week The most often used markers are the creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) fraction and the troponin I (TnI) or troponin T (TnT) levels. On the basis of the ECG, a distinction is made between ST elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). Risk Factors Older age Male sex Tobacco smoking Hypercholesterolemia (more accurately hyperlipoproteinemia, especially high low density lipoprotein and low high density lipoprotein) Hyperhomocysteinemia Diabetes (with or without insulin resistance) High blood pressure Obesity (defined by a body mass index of more than 30 kg/ m2) Stress Occupations. Women who use combined oral contraceptive pills. The most serious of these arrhythmias is ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib/VF), an extremely fast and chaotic hea rhythm that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death. Another life threatening arrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia (V-Tach/VT). Different zones of the hea can become injured: - An occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary aery(LAD) will result in an anterior wall myocardial infarct. - Infarcts of the lateral wall are caused by occlusion of the left circumflex coronary aery(LCx) or its oblique marginal branches (or even large diagonal branches from the LAD.) Both inferior wall and posterior wall infarctions may be caused by occlusion of either the right coronary aery or the left circumflex aery, depending on which feeds the posterior descending aery. Right ventricular wall infarcts are also caused by right coronary aery occlusion. Electrocardiogram The 12 lead ECG is used to classify patients into one of three groups: Those with ST segment elevation or new bundle branch block Those with ST segment depression or T wave inversion Those with a so-called non-diagnostic or normal ECG. Complications - Congestive hea failure Myocardial rupture is most common three to five days after myocardial infarction, commonly of small degree. - Life-threatening arrhythmia-The re-entry phenomenon may cause rapid hea rates (ventricular tachycardia and even ventricular fibrillation), and ischemia in the electrical conduction system of the hea may cause a complete hea block - Pericarditis-In Dressler's syndrome, this occurs several weeks after the initial event. - Cardiogenic shock",

        "exp": "Pulmonary thromboembolism REF: Harrison's Internal Medicine 17th edition Chapter 256. Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Thromboembolism PULMONARY THROMBOEMBOLISM: Pathophysiology When venous thrombi dislodge from their site of formation, they embolize to the pulmonary aerial circulation or, paradoxically, to the aerial circulation through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. About half of patients with pelvic vein thrombosis or proximal leg DVT develop PE, which is usually asymptomatic. With increased use of chronic indwelling central venous catheters for hyperalimentation and chemotherapy, as well as more frequent inseion of permanent pacemakers and internal cardiac defibrillators, upper extremity venous thrombosis is becoming a more common problem. These thrombi rarely embolize and cause PE. Pathophysiological abnormalities include: The most common gas exchange abnormalities are hypoxemia (decreased aerial P02) and an increased alveolar-aerial 02 tension gradient, which represents the inefficiency of 02 transfer across the lungs Increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to vascular obstruction or platelet secretion of vasoconstricting neurohumoral agents such as serotonin. Impaired gas exchange due to increased alveolar dead space from vascular obstruction, hypoxemia from alveolar hypoventilation relative to perfusion in the nonobstructed lung, right-to-left shunting, and impaired carbon monoxide transfer due to loss of gas exchange surface. Alveolar hyperventilation due to reflex stimulation of irritant receptors Increased airway resistance due to constriction of airways distal to the bronchi Decreased pulmonary compliance due to lung edema, lung hemorrhage, or loss of surfactant Signs & Symptoms Sudden-onset dyspnea (shoness of breath) Tachypnea (rapid breathing) Chest pain of a \"pleuritic\" nature (worsened by breathing) Cough and hemoptysis (coughing up blood). More severe cases can include signs such as cyanosis (blue discoloration, usually of the lips and fingers), collapse, and circulatory instability due to decreased blood flow through the lungs and into the left side of the hea. Occasionally, a pleural friction rub may be audible over the affected area of the lung (mostly in PE with infarct) A pleural effusion is sometimes present that is transudative A low-grade fever may be present, paicularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction About 15% of all cases of sudden death are attributable to PE Risk factors The most common sources of embolism are proximal leg deep venous thrombosis (DVTs) or pelvic vein thromboses. The development of thrombosis is classically due to a group of causes named Virchow's triad (alterations in blood flow, factors in the vessel wall and factors affecting the propeies of the blood). Often, more than one risk factor is present. Alterations in blood flow: immobilization (after surgery, injury or long-distance air travel), pregnancy (also procoagulant), obesity (also procoagulant), cancer (also procoagulant) Factors in the vessel wall: of limited direct relevance in VTE Factors affecting the propeies of the blood (procoagulant state) Estrogen-containing hormonal contraception Genetic thrombophilia (factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation G20210A, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia and plasminogen/fibrinolysis disorders) Acquired thrombophilia (antiphospholipid syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria) Cancer (due to secretion of pro-coagulants) Diagnosis D-dimer is highly sensitive but not very specific (specificity around 50%). In other words, a positive D-dimer is not synonymous with PE, but a negative D-dimer is, with a good degree of ceainty, an indication of absence of a PE The gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) is pulmonary angiography CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a pulmonary angiogram obtained using computed tomography (CT) with radiocontrast rather than right hea catheterization. Its advantages are clinical equivalence, its non-invasive nature, its greater availability to patients Ventilation/perfusion scan (or V/Q scan or lung scintigraphy), which shows that some areas of the lung are being ventilated but not perfused with blood (due to obstruction by a clot). This type of examination is used less often because of the more widespread availability of CT technology, however, it may be useful in patients who have an allergy to iodinated contrast or in pregnancy due to lower radiation exposure than CT",

Examination reveals ptosis and slight divergence of the right eye. Extraocular movements are limited in all directions, except laterally. The right pupil is larger than the left and poorly reactive to light. Examination of the fundus fails to reveal papilledema. Which of the following is the most likely underlying condition?",
        "exp": "This patient displays signs of oculomotor palsy, with restriction of the eye movements in all directions (except laterally, due to preservation of the sixth cranial nerve, the abducens), and ptosis. Dilatation of the pupil, which fails to react to light, is a sign of intracranial compression of the third, or oculomotor cranial nerve. This should prompt search for an underlying surgical cause of oculomotor palsy. Uncal herniation and aneurysm of the posterior communicating aery are the two most common surgical conditions leading to oculomotor palsy. In the absence of clinical evidence of increased intracranial pressure, it may be assumed that the patient has an aneurysm of the posterior communicating aery until proven otherwise. Cerebral angiography is the investigation of choice to confirm the diagnosis. All of the most common medical causes of oculomotor nerve palsy result in paresis of extraocular movements and ptosis, but the pupillary light reflex is preserved. These conditions include diabetes mellitus , giant cell aeritis , syphilis and systemic hypeension. Carcinoma of the right pulmonary apex may result in Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, enophthalmos, and loss of sweating on the affected hemiface) due to infiltration of the cervical autonomic ganglia.

Clamping of the umbilical cord doubles peripheral resistance and causes an increase in aerial blood pressure. As soon as right atrial pressure drop below left atrial pressure, the foramen ovale will close (valve-like mechanism), establishing the adult type blood circulation. The rising systemic and falling pulmonary aery pressure cause a flow reversal through the ductus aeriosus from right to left to left to right within minutes of bih. Complete closure of the ductus aeriosus appears to be due to a decline of local prostacyclin levels and usually drops within 24 to 48 hours after bih. The ductus venosus closes even later.

Renin-producing carcinomas also have been described in lung, liver, pancreas, colon, and adrenals. Renovascular hypertension is another renin-mediated form of hypertension. Obstruction of the renal artery leads to decreased renal perfusion pressure, thereby stimulating renin secretion. Over time, possibly as a consequence of secondary renal damage, this form of hypertension may become less renin-dependent.\nReference: : Davidson P R I N C I P L E S\u00a0 \u00a0and Practice O F M E D I C I N E 23rd edition page no\u00a0 1893",

It is caused by non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomic, HAV like virus. Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have been implicated in major outbreaks. In general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral infection followed by recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual and chronic infection does not occur. Occasionally, a fulminant form of hepatitis develops, with overall patient population moality rates ranging between 0.5 - 4.0%. Fulminant hepatitis occurs more frequently in pregnancy and regularly induces a moality rate of 20% among pregnant women in the 3rd trimester. Since cases of hepatitis E are not clinically distinguishable from other types of acute viral hepatitis, diagnosis is made by blood tests which detect elevated antibody levels of specific antibodies to hepatitis E in the body or by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (-PCR).

This delay allows maximal time for atrial contraction and protects the ventricle from fast stimulation. What would be the implication of early ventricular contraction on first heart sound ??\nIt has been already discussed that first heart sound occurs due to closure of the mitral valve at the start of ventricular systole or contraction.\nAt this time increased intraventricular pressure exceeds the atrial pressure and the A.V. valves close, producing first heart sound.\nKeep in mind one important fact that just before the start of the ventricular systole, the atrial contraction stops. (The atrial contraction occurs during late diastole, just before the start of ventricular systole).\nWith reduced PR interval the ventricle starts contracting, while the atria is still in a state of contraction.\nThus at the start of a ventricular contraction, the mitral valve leaflets are maximally separated because the atria is still contracting.\nThat means that ventricular systole will now push the mitral leaflet from a greater distance than usual.\nThis results in loud S (imagine the sound produced when a door is closed form a short distance or from a widely opened position. When the door is forced to shut from a large distance, obviously more sound will be produced).\nThe reverse happens in longer PR intervals -\nLarger PR interval means there is more time lag between atrial and ventricular contraction.\nThus when ventricular systole begins the mitral leaflets have already begun to close due to atrial relaxation.\nThus less force is applied to the mitral valve and its closing velocity is decreased resulting in soft S1",

C: ASD Fixed splitting denotes absence of significant variation of the splitting interval with respiration, such that the separation of A2, and P2, remains unchanged during inspiration and expiration. Atrial septal defect, with either normal or high pulmonary vascular resistance, is the classic example of fixed splitting of the second sound. The fixed nature of the split is due to approximately equal inspiratory delay of the aoic and pulmonic components, indicating that the two ventricles share a common venous reservoir. Respiratory splitting of the second sound immediately returns to normal following surgical repair of an atrial septa] defect, although the pulmonic closure sound may remain delayed for weeks or months. Severe right hea failure can lead to a relatively fixed split. This occurs because the right ventricle fails to respond to the increased volume produced by inspiration and because the lungs are so congested that impedance to forward flow from the right ventricle barely falls during inspiration. In anomalous pulmonary venous return without atrial septal defect, fixed splitting is not usually seen despite the simultaneous inspiratory delay in aoic and pulmonic closure",

        "exp": "Ans. is `c' i.e., Nil by mouth T/T of Hypernatremia :? As hypernatremia develops, water moves out from I.C.F. to E.C.F. to maintain equal osmolality inside and outside the cell. So the intracellular fluid decreases. To compensate for this the brain cells generates idiogenic osmoles to increase the intracellular osmolality and prevent the loss of brain water. This mechanism is not instantaneous and is most prominent when hypernatremia has developed gradually. If the hypernatremia is corrected rapidly by administration of fluids, the E.C.F. osmolality lowers rapidly, and now the I. C.F becomes hyperosmotic in comparison to the E.C.F. So, now there is movement of water from serum into the brain cells to equalize the osmolality in the two compament. This results in brain swelling and most commonly it manifests as seizures in infants. (This is clinically similar to hyponatremia) Because of the dangers of ovely rapid correction, hypernatremia should not be corrected rapidly. The goal is to decrease the serum sodium by less than 12-10 mEq/L even, 24 hr, at a rate of 0.5-10 mEq/h. In patients with chronic hypernatremia (hypernatremia that has been present for longer than 48 hours). The treatment regimen is 5 percent dextrose in water, intravenously At a rate of (1.35 mL/hour x patient's weight in kg), or About 70 mL per hour in a 50 kg patient and 100 mL per hour in a 70 kg patient. The goal of this regimen is to lower the serum sodium by a maximum of 10 meq/L in a 24-hour period (0.4 meq/ L/hour). In patients with known acute hypernatremia (hypernatremia that has been present for 48 hours or less). The treatment regimen is (see 'Initial fluid repletion regimen' above) :- 5 percent dextrose in water, intravenously, at a rate of 3 to 6 mL/kg per hour The serum sodium and blood glucose should be monitored every one to two hours until the serum sodium is lowered below 145 meq/L. Once the serum sodium concentration has reached 145 meq/L, the rate of infusion is reduced to 1 mL/kg/hour and continued until normonatremia (140 meq/L) is restored. The goal of this regimen is to lower the serum sodium by 1 to 2 meq/L per hour and to restore normonatremia in less than 24 hours. Patients with diabetes insipidus will also require desmopressin therapy, which is discussed elsewhere. Hyperglycemia may develop with rapid infusions of 5 percent dextrose; to avoid increased water losses from glycosuria, a slower rate of infusion or a change to 2.5 percent dextrose in water may be required after several hours. Risk of correctionof hypernatremia. The treatment goal for chronic hypernatremia is designed to lower the serum sodium by 10 meq/L in 24 hours (12 meq/L in 24 hours is considered the maximum safe limit, 10 meq/L in 24 hours is chosen to increase to safety",

Bypassing the AV node, the atrial rate of 300 beats/ minute may lead to a ventricular rate of 300 beats/ minute (1:1 conduction). Even if the ventricles are able to sustain a cardiac output at such a high rates, 1:1 flutter with time may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, causing hemodynamic collapse and death.",

        "exp": "This patient is experiencing the early phase of type I hypersensitivity, characterized by pruritus and watery discharge from the nose, bronchospasm, mucus secretion in the airways, and a wheal-and-flare response with pruritus in the skin. The mechanism of hypersensitivity involves prior sensitization of a population of TH2 cells that produced cytokines, including interleukin-4. The interleukin-4 causes B cells to switch their heavy chain class from IgM to IgE. The IgE molecules then attach to mast cells or basophils. With subsequent antigen (allergen) challenge, the mast cells degranulate and release mediators, including histamine, which produces the anaphylactic response. Eosinophils are involved in type I hypersensitivity reactions as well as type II antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity reactions directed against parasites. Eosinophils enter the area of the reaction due to the release of eosinophil chemotactic factor (eotaxin) and the beta-chemokine RANTES released from TH2 CD4+ cells and mast cells. Eosinophils are recruited into the tissues as pa of the late-phase reaction of type I hypersensitivity. Their survival in tissue is dependent upon IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) released from TH2 cells. Megakaryocytes are bone marrow cells that produces platelets. They are not involved in type I hypersensitivity.

If the murmur is harsher and has a lot of low and medium frequencies. It usually indicates a lot of flow and therefore will imply significant regurgitation. A harsh decrescendo mitral regurgitation murmur is usually indicative of severe regurgitation because the decrscendo effect is caused by early buildup of a very high v wave pressure in the left atrium resulting from a severe degree of regurgitation. Thus decreasing the gradient in late systole (If the murmur, on the other hand, is all pure high frequency and confined only to late systole. Then it must indicate a high pressure difference between the left ventricle and the left atrium and therefore only mild regurgitation). When the mitral regurgitation is severe, the volume overload on the left ventricle will be high, resulting in an enlarged left ventricle. This may be reflected in a displaced hyperdynamic wide -area left ventricular apical impulse. In addition, the hyperdynamic left ventricle will have rapid ejection. This will make the A2 occur early. Resulting in a wide-split S2. Thus, a wide -split S2 in the presence of mitral regurgitation is a sign of severe regurgitation if the wide split is not caused by P2 delay. In addition, severe regurgitation because of the volume load effect will have a torrential inflow through the mitral valve during diastole. This will set up the necessary conditions for the production of an S3 or a mid -diastolic inflow rumble. The presence of an S3 or an inflow rumble at the apex will, therefore, be a sign of significant mitral regurgitation as well.

Hp-Hb complex is removed from plasma by haptocytes. Levels of haptoglobin falls rapidly in situations where hemoglobin is constantly being released from RBC such as occurs in hemolytic anemia (haemorrhage). But in case of parenchymal liver disease, Hp-Hb complex removal is deranged so reduction in haptoglobin level is masked. Haptoglobin It is a plasma glycoprotein that binds extracapsular hemoglobin (Hb) in a tight non-covalent complex. Its amount ranges from 40mg- 180 mg of hemoglobin binding capacity / deciliter. Only 10% of degraded hemoglobin is released in circulation (i.e. extra corpuscular) the remaining 90% is present in old damaged RBCs, which are degraded by histiocytic system. Free Hb (molecular mass 65KDa) passes through glomerulus and precipitate in tubules. However, after binding with haptoglobin (90 KDa) the Hb-Hp complex (155KDa) becomes too large to pass through glomerulus. So the function of haptoglobin is to prevent loss of free hemoglobin into kidney and conserve the valuable iron present in hemoglobin, which would otherwise be lost to the body. Humans have 3 polymorphic forms, k/a Hp 1-1, Hp 2-1, Hp 2-2. Low levels of haptoglobins are found in patients with hemolytic anemia. This is explained by the fact that where the life of Hp is 5 days, the t1/2 of Hb-Hp complex is 90 minutes, the complex being rapidly removed by hepatocytes. So when the hepatoglobin is bound to Hb, it is cleared from plasma about 80 times faster than normally.

Klinefelter's syndrome is characterized by small testes, infeility, gynecomastia, eunuchoid propoions, and incomplete virilization in phenotypic males. Biopsies done shows seminiferous tubule hyalinization and azoospermia. They are at increased risk of breast tumors, thromboembolic disease, learning difficulties, obesity, diabetes mellitus, varicose veins. Laboratory investigations shows elevated levels of FSH and LH and low levels of testosterone reflecting primary gonadal failure. Levels of estradiol is increased due to chronic Leydig cell stimulation by LH and because of aromatization of androstenedione by adipose tissue. The increased estradiol/testosterone ratio results in gynecomastia. Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18e chapter 349, By John C. Achermann; J. Larry Jameson.",
