        "exp": "Ans. (b) Tall T waves in ECGRef: Harrison 19th ed. / 307,310* The earliest electrocardiogram (ECG) change associated with hypokalemia is a decrease in the T-wave amplitude.* As potassium levels decline further, ST-segment depression and T-wave inversions are seen, while the PR interval can be prolonged along with an increase in the amplitude of the P wave.* The U wave is described as a positive deflection after the T wave, often best seen in the mid-precordial leads (eg, V2 and V3). When the U wave exceeds the T-wave amplitude, the serum potassium level is < 3 mEq/L.* In severe hypokalemia, T- and U-wave fusion with giant U waves masking the smaller preceding T waves becomes apparent on the ECG.* A pseudo-prolonged QT interval may be seen, which is actually the QU interval with an absent T wave.Severe hypokalemia can also cause a variety of tachyarrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia/ fibrillation and rarely atrioventricular block.",
