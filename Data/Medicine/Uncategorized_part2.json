        "exp": "Ans. D: Hypoglycemia Symptoms of Cushing's syndrome include rapid weight gain, paicularly of the trunk and face with sparing of the limbs (central obesity). A common sign is the growth of fat pads along the collar bone and on the back of the neck (buffalo hump) and a round face often referred to as a \"moon face\". Other symptoms include hyperhidrosis (excess sweating), telangiectasia (dilation of capillaries), thinning of the skin (which causes easy bruising and dryness, paicularly the hands) and other mucous membranes, purple or red striae (the weight gain in Cushing's syndrome stretches the skin, which is thin and weakened, causing it to hemorrhage) on the trunk, buttocks, arms, legs or breasts, proximal muscle weakness (hips, shoulders), and hirsutism (facial male-pattern hair growth), baldness and/or cause hair to become extremely dry and brittle. In rare cases, Cushing's can cause hypercalcemia, which can lead to skin necrosis Other signs include polyuria (and accompanying polydipsia), persistent hypeension (due to coisol's enhancement of epinephrine's vasoconstrictive effect) and insulin resistance (especially common in ectopic ACTH production), leading to hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) which can lead to diabetes mellitus. Cushing's syndrome due to excess ACTH may also result in hyperpigmentation, such as acanthosis nigricans in the axilla. This is due to Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone production as a byproduct of ACTH synthesis from Pro-opiomelanocoin (POMC). Coisol can also exhibit mineralcoicoid activity in high concentrations, worsening the hypeension and leading to hypokalemia (common in ectopic ACTH secretion). Fuhermore, gastrointestinal disturbances, oppounistic infections and impaired wound healing (coisol is a stress hormone, so it depresses the immune and inflammatory responses). Osteoporosis is also an issue in Cushing's syndrome",

Globus Pallidus Internus (GPi) is the second most common site for Deep Brain Stimulation in patients with Parkinsonism and provides comparable results to DBS of STN. Subthalamic nucleus and Globus Pallidus Internus both provide comparable efficacy (Believed to be equally effective) Other Targets Ventral Intermediate Nucleus of Thalamus (VMI) (Efficacious only in relieving Tremor from Parkinsonism. Other Parkinsonian motor symptoms may not respond and hence this target is not preferred) Pedunculopantine Nucleus (DBS of Pedunculopontine nucleus may be beneficial for patients with advanced parkinsonism and predominant axial symptoms, postural instability and gait disturbance. Results are however still limited to only a few patients) (Springer) 2007/180; Mardsen's Book of movement Disorders (Oxford) 2012/298 Subthalamic Nucleus is widely accepted as the preferred site for Deep Brain Stimulation (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) for patients with Parkinsonism. Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease (Taken from Operative Neuromodulation) Deep Brain Stimulation has become a standard therapy for patients with advanced Parkinson's Disease Although clinical efficacy of both GPi and STN stimulation is comparable it has become widely accepted to prefer STN over GPi The Rationale for STN targeting include: (i) The stimulation energy required to gain maximum clinical improvement seem to be lower for STN than for GPi (ii) STN stimulation seems to have more prominant and stable effects on L-DOPA responsive off-period symptoms in the long term. Subthalamic Nucleus Stimulation effectively improves all cardinal motor symptoms including gait, posture and balance and is the preferred target in Europe and Noh America' - Mardsen's Book of MOvement Disorders (Oxford) 2012/298 Note: STN stimulation bears a higher risk of cognitive and neuropsychiatric behavioural complications in comparison to GPi stimulation. GPI stimulation may be preferred over STN stimulation for patients with pre-existing conditions like depression. Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkison's Disease: Review What is Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) DBS is a relatively new procedure that uses an implantable electrode into a specific target in the brain and is attached to a programmable pulse generator. The pulse generator is implanted in a pocket below the clavicle and connected to the DBS electrode in the Brain. (The pulse generation is just like a cardiac pacemaker but the wire goes to the specific site in the brain) What is the principle of DBS in Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's disease is characterized by loss of dopaminergic input to the striatium, which has been shown to be associated with hyperactivity of two key nuclei within the basal ganglia, namely the subthalamic nucleus and the Globus Pallidus Internus. Dopaminergic dennervation in PD leads to increased firing of neurons in the STN and GPi resulting in excessive inhibition of the thalamus, reduced activation of the coical motor systems and development of Parkinsonian Features. DBS is believed to reduce the neuronal overactivity of the STN and/or the GPi and thereby improve features of PD. What specific regions in the brain are targetted by DBS There are three brain targets that have been FDA approved for use in Parkinson's Disease for Deep Brain Stimulation Subthalamic nucleus (STN): Most preferred & commonly used target Globus pallidus Internus (GPi): Effective target (Results comparable with STN) Thalamus (Ventral Intermediate Nucleus): Only effective in relieving Tremor (not preferred anymore) What are the indications for DBS (Ideal candidate) The procedure is primarily indicated for patients who suffer disability from levodopa induced motor complications that cannot be satisfactorily controlled with drug manipulation. Symptoms that improve DBS are essentially the same individual symptoms that improve with levodopa (dopamine) with the exception of medication refractory tremor and dyskinesias. DBS provides effective relief from all cardinal dopaminergic motor symptoms including gait, posture and balance. Improves tremor, rigidity bradykinesia. It provides dramatic result with respect to \"off' time and dyskinesias but does not improve features that fail to respond to levodopa. It does not prevent the development or progression of non-dopaminergic features such as freezing, falling and dementia. DBS does not improve cognitive (thinking ability). Decrease the dose of medications required (in many but not all cases)",

C: Recovery in terms of lung functions is poor in ARDS survivors Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by the development of sudden and severe breathlessness, hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrate. Clinical Conditions Associated with Development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Direct lung injury - Pneumonia (associated in nearly 40% cases) - Aspiration of gastric contents - Inhalation injury - Near drowning - Pulmonary contusion - Fat embolism Reperfusion pulmonary edema post lung transplantation or pulmonary embolectomy Indirect lung injury - Sepsis Severe trauma - Acute pancreatitis - Cardiopulmonary bypass - Massive transfusions - Drug overdose ARDS typically develops within 12-48 hours after the inciting event. Persons developing ARDS are critically ill, often with multisystem organ failure. ARDS is associated with severe and diffuse injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane of the lungs. Fluid accumulates in some alveoli of the lungs, while some other alveoli collapse. This alveolar damage impedes the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which leads to a reduced concentration of oxygen in the blood. Low levels of oxygen in the blood cause damage to other vital organs of the body such as the kidneys. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is present if Pao2/Fio2 ratio Moality rates ranges from 41 to 65% with non pulmonary cases accounting for more than 80% of deaths.

Phosphate retention begins early in the course of CKD, perhaps as early as in stage 2 and paicipates in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Central to the management of high-turnover bone disease is controlling the serum phosphate levels. This may be achieved by dietary phosphate restriction or by the use of phosphate binders. Phosphate-binder therapy is recommended when serum phosphate concentrations are elevated despite patient compliance with dietary phosphate restriction. Calcium-based phosphate binders are often recommended as the initial binder therapy. High Bone Turnover Disease Bone turnover (the formation and removal of bone) is increased due to a process called secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT).

Schilling test is abnormal in conditions that affect cobalamine absorption including Pernicious anemia, Chronic Pancreatitis, Bacterial overgrowth syndrome and Heal dysfunction. Conditions with Abnormal Schilling's Test (Abnormal Cobalamine Absorption) Pernicious anemia Chronic Pancreatitis Achlorhydria Bacterial overgrowth syndrome Beal dysfunction Schilling Test: Schilling test is performed to determine the cause of cobalamine malabsorption (Vit B12 malabsorption). Since cobalamine absorption requires multiple steps including gastric, pancreatic and ileal processes, the Schilling test can also be used to assess the integrity of these other organs. The Schilling test is performed by administering Co58-labeled cobalamin orally and collecting urine for 24h 1 mg of cobabmine is administed intramuscularly one hour after ingestion of the Radiolabelled cobalamine. This is done to ensure saturation of cobalamine binding sites in the liver as urinary excretion of cobalamine will reflect cobalamine absorption only provided that intrahepatic binding sites of cobalamine are fully occupied. Once intrahepatic binding sites of cobalamine are saturated all absorbed radiolabelled cobalamine will be excreted in urine. The Schilling test may be abnormal (defined as less than 10 percent excretion in 241i) in conditions that affect cobalamine absorption including Pernicious anemia, Chronic Pancreatitis, Bacterial overgrowth syndrome and Heal dysfunction. The etiology for an abnormal Schilling test may be deduced by administering Co58-labeled cobalamin with intrinsic factor, pancreatic enzymes or after 5 day course of antibiotics. Differential Results of Schilling Test in various diseases associated with cobalamin malabsorption may thus help establish the diagnosis.

P wave becomes \"tall\" in RA enlargement and \"wide\" with LA enlargement Components of P wave RA component The SA node depolarises the RA first, so the initial pa of P wave represents RA current. After about 40 msec the wave front reaches LA and it begins it's depolarisation. LA component By the time LA is maximally depolarized the RA already stas its repolarisation. So there is overlap and also a sho time lag between these two wave forms. This is very impoant to recognise as, even if the RA conduction is prolonged in pathology the RA component of P-wave still falls within the LA wave. Hence it is not shown in the ECG and P wave is not widened in RA enlargement. This is in contrast to LA enlargement, when the terminal half of P vector delayed it stretches the P wave wide beyond the normal 100ms. Hence LAE widens the P wave. P wave becomes taller in RA enlargement In classical P pulmonale, the P wave is tall > 2.5 mm. It is easy to explain why it not getting wide than why it is getting taller The atrial vector has two components. The initial RA vector, is directed anteriorly. The main reason is due to the anatomical proximity of RA to the chest wall. Fuher the atrial electrical dp/dt is fast, so the slope of forward limb is steep. Any RA voltage increase is easily picked up by the chest leads. LAE can not produce tall P wave The left atrial vector which follows RA vector is mainly directed posteriorly and hence inscribe a descending limb of P wave. This causes the P terminal force. So the direction of vector forces and the anatomical locality make a tall and positive P deflection highly improbable in LAE.",

Investigations: CBC shows neutrophilic leucocytosis, anemia of chronic disease and an elevated ESR. Antibodies against myeloperoxidase or proteinase-3 (ANCA) is rarely found. Urine shows evidence of proteinuria and hematuria. Diagnosis is made by the biopsy of the organ involved, which shows evidence of vasculitis.

Lacunar Infarcts Lacunar infarcts are small vessel strokes caused by occlusion of a single penetrating aery that supplies one of the deep structures in brain such as the internal capsule, corona radiate, basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem. These are usually caused by Lipohyalinosis of penetrating aeries from longstanding hypeension, atherosclerosis or diabetes Several distinct syndromes are associated with lacunar infarcts. Distinct clinical syndromes associated with lacunar infarcts. Pure motor Hemiparesis Most common lacunar syndrome Results from infarction of contralateral internal capsule (may also be seen with infarcts in corona radiate and pons) The face, arm and leg are equally affected There is no sensory loss, homonymous hemianopia, Aphasia or hemineglect Pure sensory stroke Infarction almost always involves the thalamus Sensory loss is present throughout the contralateral side, but various paial hemisensory syndrome can occur. Sensation is usually decreased for all sensory modalities, and no other neurologic deficits are present. Patient often complains of abnormal spontaneous sensation, such as \"pins-and?needles\" or skin tightness. Sensorimotor stroke Infarcts involve both internal capsule and thalamus Ataxic Hemiparesis Contralateral weakness and limb ataxia Weakness and ataxia present on the same side with the ataxia usually more severe than the weakness. Most commonly occurs in the pons, the internal capsule or the corona radiata Dysahria Clumsiness Syndrome Prominent dysahria and ataxia of the upper limb Facial weakness, dysphagia and varying degrees of weakness in the arm and leg Associated with infarction in the internal capsule or the pons.",

Note Serum ferritin levels are a good index of body iron stores and are raised early during the cause of disease. Yet serum ferritin levels should not he used as initial screening test to detect hereditary hematochromatosis.

Citrate is generally tolerated better than sodium bicarbonate and can be given as the potassium or sodium salt, depending on the severity of hypokalemia. In patients who present later with kidney stones. large fluid intake and sufficient alkali to restore normal acid-basebalance, correct the hypocitraturia and reduce hypercalciuria, thereby inhibiting the formation of new stones Treatment of Type 2 (Proximal) A It is difficult to restore normal acid-base balance in patients with proximal A despite large amounts of alkali. This is the case because they continue to waste bicarbonate (fractional excretion >15%) until the serum level falls below a threshold, usually about 15-17 mmol/L, at which time bicarbonate is completely reabsorbed distally and the urine is maximally acidified with pH <5.5. When the serum bicarbonate concentration is raised above the threshold with alkali therapy, bicarbonate wasting recurs and causes hypokalemia as potassium is secreted to maintain luminal electroneutrality.

Daytime sleepiness, distinct from fatigue, is a common feature of OSA Sleepiness is the inability to remain fully awake or ale during the wakefulness poion of the sleep-wake cycle. Snoring is the other common feature of OSA. While snoring is associated with a sensitivity of 80 to 90 percent for the diagnosis of OSA, its specificity is below 50 percent. Clinical features of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) Daytime sleepiness Obesity Nonrestorative sleep Large neck circumference Loud snoring Systemic hypeension Witnessed apneas by bed paner Hypercapnia Awakening with choking Cardiovascular disease Nocturnal restlessness Cerebrovascular disease Insomnia with frequent awakenings Cardiac dysrhythmias Lack of concentration Narrow or \"crowded\" airway Cognitive deficits Pulmonary hypeension Changes in mood Cor pulmonale Morning headaches Polycythemia Vivid, strange, or threatening dreams Floppy eyelid syndrome Gastroesophageal reflux Nocturia Polysomnography Full-night, attended, in-laboratory polysomnography is considered the \"gold-standard diagnostic\" test for OSA. It involves monitoring the patient during a full night's sleep. Unattended, out of centre sleep \"(OCST) may be used as an alternative to polysomnography for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with a high pre-test probability of moderate to severe OSA, provided there are no medical comorbidities such as hea failure that predispose to alternative or additional sleep related breathing disorders. The diagnosis of OSA is based upon the presence or absence of related symptoms, as well as the frequency of respiratory events during sleep (ie, apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory effo related arousals IRERAsJ as measured by polysomnography or out-of-center sleep testing (OCST).

        "exp": "Ans. D: Dark field microscopy Laboratory examinations for syphilis: In its primary and secondary stages, syphilis can often be diagnosed by dark-field examination of fresh exudate obtained from lesions. Because the exudates from non-syphilitic lesions may also contain spiral organisms, the result must be interpreted with care.T. pallidum may also be identified by immunfluorescent staining. Dark field microscopy is paicularly impoant in suspected early primary syphilis before serological tests become reactive. Specimens from genital ulcers or other lesions consistent with a chancre and from skin lesions of secondary syphilis, especially condylomata lata should be examined by dark field microscopy. Flocculation tests for Wasserman Abs are of great value in the presumptive diagnosis/ screening of syphilis or quantitation of syphilis antibody. The Wasserman antigen is a phospholipid known as cardiolipin which is a normal constituent of host tissue. The standard is the VDRL test. The RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) test is another widely used test. However, a wide variety of other diseases e.g. malaria, SLE, leprosy, and other infections may give a false-positive result. Wasserman antibody is usually detected 1 to 3 weeks after the primary lesion appears and reaches a maximum during the second stage of infection. Subsequently, this antibody may remain at an elevated level. However, it is only positive in 71% of patients with teiary syphilis and thus a negative VDRL test does not exclude late syphilis. Tests for treponemal antibody, such as the TPI (T. pallidum immobilisation) test, are more specific but are not generally available. The more widely performed fluorescent antibody (FTA) test is positive in 84% of patients with primary syphilis and in almost all patients with secondary or latent syphilis and 96% in teiary syphilis. It should therefore not be used as a screening test. The TPHA test is similar to the FTA test in its sensitivity and specificity. Antitreponemal antibodies decline more slowly than Wasserman antibody after treatment, and positive reactions may persist for years",

The diagnosis is established by reticulocytosis, increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear findings. In most of the cases, a bone marrow aspirate is not necessary in the diagnostic workup; if it is done, it shows erythroid hyperplasia. Premature destruction of erythrocytes occurs intravascularly or extravascularly. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane is damaged in circulation, leading to intravascular hemolysis and the appearance of schistocytes. Infectious agents such as malaria and babesiosis invade red blood cells. Disorders of red blood cell enzymes, membranes, and hemoglobin cause hereditary hemolytic anemias. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to hemolysis in the presence of oxidative stress. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by spherocytes, a family history, and a negative direct antiglobulin test. Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies characterized by chronic hemolysis.",

Lifson AR, Bond WW, Petersen NJ, Gravelle CR, Favero MS. Hepatitis B virus in peritoneal dialysis fluid: A potential hazard. Dialysis and Transplantation 1982; 11:592-600.) Harrison says that serum, semen and saliva are most infectious for hepatitis B transmission.

BODY FLUIDS TO WHICH UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS APPLY: *Universal precautions apply to blood and to other body fluids containing visible blood. *Blood is the single most impoant source of HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens in the occupational setting *Universal precautions also apply to tissues and to the following fluids: semen and vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), synol fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, and amniotic fluid. BODY FLUIDS TO WHICH UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS DO NOT APPLY: *Universal precautions do not apply to feces, nasal secretions, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, and vomitus unless they contain visible blood *The risk of transmission of HIV and HBV from these fluids and materials is extremely low or nonexistent. *Human breast milk has been implicated in perinatal transmission of HIV, and HBsAg has been found in the milk of mothers infected with HBV (10, 13). However, occupational exposure to human breast milk has not been implicated in the transmission of HIV nor HBV infection to health-care workers. *Whereas universal precautions do not apply to human breast milk, gloves may be worn by health-care workers in situations where exposures to breast milk might be frequent, for example, in breast milk banking. * Universal precautions do not apply to saliva. Saliva of some persons infected with HBV has been shown to contain HBV-DNA at concentrations 1/1,000 to 1/10,000 of that found in the infected person's serum.

The haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex is quickly cleared from the blood by the reticuloendothelial system, which allows the hemoglobin to be salvaged instead of lost into the urine. Intravascular hemolysis from any cause is rapidly followed by a dramatic drop in serum haptoglobin. Bilirubin is synthesized in the liver and spleen as an end-product of heme degradation. Serum bilirubin levels would not change until the haptoglobin in the blood was completely saturated, and free hemoglobin began to circulate. In this circumstance, serum bilirubin would increase, not decrease. C-reactive protein an acute phase reactant produced by the liver in increased quantity in response to inflammation. This patient's urinary tract infection would increase C-reactive protein levels, but the hemolysis would not fuher affect them. Serum free iron does not change appreciably in intravascular hemolysis.

The current evidence the primary bioactive form of Vitamin E is alfa-tocopherol. Serum vitamin E levels are strongly influenced by concentration of serum lipids, and do not accurately reflect tissue vitamin levels. Effective vitamin E levels are calculated as the ratio of serum alpha-tocopherol per gram total lipids. Absorption of dietary vitamin E requires effective pancreatic exocrine function and fat absorption, unless provided in a synthetic water-soluble form.

Neuropathy associated with Axonal degeneration is often called 'dying back neuropathy' as degeneration usually proceeds from distal to proximal. Neuropathy associated with Diabetes mellitus, Porphyria and Arsenic are primarily caused by axonal degeneration and represent examples of dying back neuropathy. GBS is primarily a demyelinating neuropathy and is the single best answer of choice. Pathology of Ncuropathy Axonal Degeneration (Retrograde) (Dying Back Neuropathy) Retrograde Axonal Degeneration is one type of classical response of nerve to an insult and consists of degeneration of axon from distal to proximal (Referred to as 'Dying back neuropathy) This type of degeneration is most commonly seen after toxic and metabolic injuries (Since the distal axon is the poion fahest from the cell body it is most vulnerable to toxic and metabolic derangements) Neuropathies resulting from Toxins (eg Arsenic) and.Metabolic derrangements (Diabetes, Porphyria) are pathologically caused by axonal degeneration (Refer Harrison 16th/2504, 2505) and may hence be grouped as dying back neuropathies. Demyelination Demyelination is another type of response of nerve to an insult Such demyelination is associated with a' ' conduction block' which results from failure of nerve conduction across the demyelinated segment and results in a rapid onset type neuropathy (weakness) Neuropathies resulting from demyelination do not have a distal to proximal progression and may occur either distally The primary pathological process in GBS is demyelination (although associated axonal degeneration may he present) and hence it represents an example of Demyelinating neuropathies and not a type of dying back neuropathy",

A more specific confirmatory test is an increase in fibrin split products, such as \"D-dimers.\" Characteristically, DIC clinically produces a mix of hemorrhagic and coagulative complications, and is difficult to treat because correcting the coagulative tendency tends to worsen the hemorrhage, and correcting the hemorrhagic tendency tends to worsen thrombotic complications.

On examination, liver and spleen were enlarged 4 cm and 3 cm respectively below the costal margins. His hemoglobin was 10.0 g/dl, platelet count 37 x 109/L and total leukocyte count 70 x 109/L, which included 80% eosinophils. Bone marrow examination revealed a cellular marrow comprising 45% blasts and 34% eosinophils and eosinophilic precursors. The blasts stained negative for myeloperoxidase and nonspecific esterase and were positive for CD19, CDIO, CD22 and CD20. Which one of the following statements in not true about this disease?",

Journal Source: Ann Hematol. 2000 May;79(5):272-4. Authors: Jain P, Kumar R, Gujral S, Kumar A, Singh A, Jain Y, Dubey S, Anand M, Arya LS. A four-year-old boy presented with marked peripheral blood eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count of 54 x 10(9)/1), features of hypereosinophilic syndrome, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-L2), the latter characterized by the presence of granular blasts. Blasts were negative for myeloperoxidase, non-specific esterase, acid phosphatase, periodic-acid Schiff stain, and toluidine blue. They exhibited an early pre-B immunophenotype (TdT, CD19, CDIO, CD20 and CD22 positive) and stained negative for T (CD7, CD2, CD5 and CD3) and myeloid markers (MPO, CD33 and CD13). Chromosomal analysis revealed a normal karyotype. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first repo of the coexistence of granular ALL and hypereosinophilic syndrome. Why Hypereosinophillic Syndrome Option A Explanation Idiopathic hypereosinophillic syndrome is a rare condition characterized by extremely high levels of peripheral blood eosinophil counts. (80% of (70 x 109) Leucocytes were eosinophils in this patient) Clinical picture of dry cough, dyspnea, wheezing etc is fuher suggestive of HES. This is differentiated from eosinophillic leukaemia by the absence of eosinophilic blast cells.

The possible mechanism causing malabsorption are : Bacterial deconjugation of bile salts : In contrast to conjugated bile salts, unconjugated bile salts may be absorbed in the proximal small bowel resulting in decreased intraluminal concentration of bile salts in Jejunum. This leads to impaired micelle formation and hence fat malabsorption. Utilization of vit Bp by bacteria: The impaired absorbtion of vit Bp is not related to above disturbed bile salt metabolism, but appears to be due to uptake of vit Bp by microorganisms i.e. competition for vit B,2 by bacteria.
