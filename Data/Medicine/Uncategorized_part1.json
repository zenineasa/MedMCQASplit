But in the male child, the effect of increased testosterone will not be manifested at the time of birth.\nThe complete21 hydroxylase deficiency or salt wasting syndrome usually comes to light only after the birth because in utero the electrolytes and uids\ncan be maintained by maternal kidneys. Males with this disorder comes to clinical attention 5 to 15 days later because of salt losing crisis while\nfemales come to attention soon after the birth because of the virilization.\nB) Simple Virilizing adrenogenital syndrome (Partial deficiency) Occurs in individuals\nwith partial deficiency of 21 hydroxylases Less severe deficiency of mineralocorticoid, is sufficient for salt reabsorption, but the lowered glucocorticoid fails to cause\nfeedback inhibition of ACTH secretion.\nThus level of aldosterone is mildly reduced, testosterone is increased and ACTH elevated with resultant adrenal hyperplasia.\n11B hydroxylase deficiency-. Rare Leads to decreased cortisol and increased ACTH.\nThis, in turn, leads to the accumulation of DOC (deoxycorticosterone) and 11 deoxycortisol\nboth of which are strong mineralocorticoids.

The syndrome that closest matches the features provided in the question is Waardeburg syndrome type-I. This is inherited as an autosomal dominant fashion and hence is the answer of exclusion. As the question does not provide us with details as to the sex of the three children, a sex linked inheritance pattern cannot be worked out. Also the combined presentation of an affected father, unaffected mother and one affected child among three children is possible with both an autosomal dominant and an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. In absence of any more details, the answer to this question cannot be deduced through the exploration of various permutations and combinations. How both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance can be responsible for the above combination: Autosomal Dominant Autosomal recessive (A-affected allele and a normal allele) If the disease is transmitted in an Autosomal Dominant then :Father (affected) will be either 'AA' or 'Aa' Mother (unaffected) will be 'aa' If father is AA and mother aa, the offsprings will be 1. aA - 100% affected If father is Aa and mother aa, the offsprings will Aa - 50% affected aa - 50% not affected The scenario in the above question therefore is possible autosomal dominant inheritance if father is Aa and mother is aa (A'-affected allele and 'a' normal allele) If the disease is transmitted in an Autosomal recessive form :Father (affected) will be 'AA' Mother (unaffected) may be 'aa' or 'Aa' If father is AA and mother aa, the offsprings will be 1. aA - 100% not affected, (but carriers) If father is AA and mother Aa, the offsprings will be Aa - 50% not affected, carrier AA - 50% affected The scenario in the above question therefore is possible with autosomal recessive inheritance if father is aa and mother is Aa",

Activated neutrophils are sequestered into the lungs and capillary permeability is increased, with damage to cells within the alveoli. The pathophysiology is part of the in\ufb02ammatory spectrum, and the triggers are similar: infective and non-infective in\ufb02ammatory processes. These processes result in exudation and accumulation of protein-rich cellular \ufb02uid within alveoli and the formation of characteristic \u2018hyaline membranes\u2019. Local release of cytokines and chemokines by activated macrophages and neutrophils results in progressive recruitment of in\ufb02ammatory cells. Secondary effects include loss of surfactant and impaired surfactant production. The net effect is alveolar collapse and reduced lung compliance, most marked in dependent regions of the lung (mainly dorsal in supine patients).\u00a0\nThe affected airspaces become \ufb02uid-\ufb01lled and can no longer contribute to ventilation, resulting in hypoxaemia (due to increased pulmonary shunt) and hypercapnia (due to inadequate ventilation in some areas of the lung): that is, ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch.\nReference: : Davidson P R I N C I P L E S\u00a0 \u00a0and Practice O F M E D I C I N E 23rd edition page no\u00a0 198",

Congenitally abnormal hemoglobin: Hemoglobin M Hemoglobin M is passed as an autosomal dominant trait affecting either the alpha or beta chain of hemoglobin; homozygous Hb M affecting both alpha and beta chains is incompatible with life. Amino acid substitution (often a tyrosine for histidine) near the heme iron facilitates iron oxidation. 2. Inherited enzyme deficiencies: NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 -reductase and cytochrome bc deficiency. Deficiency of either cytochrome b5 or its reducing enzyme, cytochrome b5-reductase, decreases reduction of MetHb back to Hb 3. Nitrite (NO2), other oxidants and oxygen-reducing compounds Nitrites are a common oxidizing source of MetHb production. Reducing agents paradoxically produce methemoglobinemia by reducing oxygen to a free radical or water to 1-1,O2, which then oxidizes hemoglobin. 4. \"Sensitive\" hemoglobin: Blue baby syndrome Bacteria in the immature gastrointestinal tracts of infants conve nitrate (NO3) to the powerful oxidant nitrite (NO,). Infants have a relative NADH-dependent reductase deficiency (only 50% of adult levels) and are more susceptible to oxidative injury.",

This is a sex-linked recessive disorder presenting with the triad of thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Serum IgM levels are low but IgG, IgA, and IgE levels are increased. Patients have a defective response to polysaccharide antigens, which is due to a cytoskeletal defect in T cells that inhibits their binding to B cells. A CD4/CD8 ratio of < 1.5:1 is the pattern seen in AIDS due to selective tropism of the CD4+ T-helper cell population. Cerebellar ataxia is pa of the ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome. The ataxia develops between age 2 and 5. The defect is associated with a DNA repair enzyme deficiency. Elevated platelet count and increased serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE is not associated with a paicular syndrome. Polyclonal gammopathies result in an increase in immunoglobulin of more than one class. This benign alteration is frequently seen in viral or bacterial infections.

Significant ketogenesis is restrained by the ability of the pancreas to secrete small amount of insulin.

Apixaban is one such oral direct factor Xa inhibitor; it was recently shown to be likely more effective compared with warfarin in the Apixaban for the Prevention of Stroke in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial.

Kernig's sign is positive when the leg is fully bent in the hip and knee, and subsequent extension in the knee is painful (leading to resistance).This may indicate subarachnoid haemorrhage or meningitis.Patients may also show opisthotonus --spasm of the whole body that leads to legs and head being bent back and body bowed backwards.

However, the \"trick\" pa of this question rests on the fact that roughly 80% of newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis cases in adults are actually due to reactivation of an often clinically unsuspected infection acquired years-to-decades previously.

Urea accumulates, leading to azotemia and ultimately uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy). Urea is excreted by sweating and crystallizes on skin (\"uremic frost\"). Potassium accumulates in the blood (hyperkalemia with a range of symptoms including malaise and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias) Erythropoietin synthesis is decreased (potentially leading to anemia, which causes fatigue) Fluid volume overload - symptoms may range from mild edema to life-threatening pulmonary edema Hyperphosphatemia - due to reduced phosphate excretion, associated with hypocalcemia (due to vitamin D3 deficiency).

He is complaining of fever, weight loss, cough with expectoration with foul smelling sputum, so the first d/d is lung abscess due to anaerobes. Let us see the explanations from harrison: Lung abscess: A common feature is periodontal infection with pyorrhea or gingivitis. The usual symptoms are fatigue, cough, sputum production, and fever. Chills are uncommon. Many patients have evidence of chronic disease, such as weight loss and anemia. Some patients have putrid-smelling sputum indicative of the presence of anaerobes. This is usually treated with clindamycin; the initial IV dose of 600 mg four times daily can be changed to an oral dosage of 300 mg four times daily once the patient becomes afebrile and improves clinically. The duration of therapy is until imaging shows that chest lesions have cleared or have left a small, stable scar. An alternative to clindamycin is any B-lactam/-lactamase inhibitor combination; parenteral treatment may be followed by orally administered amoxicillin/clavulanate. Penicillin was previously regarded as a preferred drug for these infections, but many oral anaerobes produce -lactamases, and clindamycin proved superior to penicillin G in a randomized clinical trial. Metronidazole is highly active against viually all anaerobes but not against aerobic microaerophilic streptococci, which play an impoant role in mixed infections. In therapeutic trials, metronidazole has done poorly unless combined with a -lactam or another agent active against aerobic and microaerophilic streptococci.

        "exp": "Long-standing inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid ahritis (RA) are associated with deposition of a form of amyloid known as AA (amyloid-associated protein), which may involve kidneys, hea, liver, skeletal muscle, and skin, for example. Amyloid deposition in the myocardium results in decreased compliance and impaired diastolic filling, i.e., restrictive cardiomyopathy. The myocardium has a rigid and waxy texture. This form of amyloid, as well as any other biochemical form, can be visualized on tissue section by staining with Congo red, which acquires a characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Constrictive pericarditis is due to any pathologic process that results in fibrous thickening of the pericardium, with resultant impaired compliance. Clinically, therefore, this condition manifests with a picture similar to restrictive cardiomyopathy because of impaired diastolic filling. Constrictive pericarditis is usually caused by previous episodes of acute pericarditis, especially hemorrhagic, suppurative, and caseous pericarditis. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by massive ventricular dilatation and may be caused by genetic alterations, myocarditis, toxic insults (alcohol), metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis), etc. Most cases are idiopathic. The main pathophysiologic alteration is impaired contractility. You may be tempted to think that this patient is prone to developing hypersensitivity myocarditis, but this form of myocardial disease has been repoed after treatment with some antihypeensive agents,antibiotics, diuretics and not with coicosteroids or NSAIDs. Fuhermore, myocarditis manifests acutely with arrhythmias and hea failure, and chronically with dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive hea failure. Ref: Hoit B.D. (2011). Chapter 34.

        "exp": "The description given above is of an individual with Graves' disease. Hypersecretion of thyroid hormone because of stimulation of the TSH receptor by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins results in excessive movement of thyroglobulin from the colloid to the plasma. The presence of exophthalmos is thought to be pa of the autoimmune disorder in Graves' disease. It is postulated that the thyroid and orbital muscles may share a common antigen. Lymphocytic infiltration and inflammation of orbital muscle then produces the ophthalmopathy. Serum T4 is increased in Graves' disease. Because of excessive stimulation of the thyroid by the thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins, radioactive iodine uptake, which assesses iodine trapping, is increased. The increase in free T4 due to hypersecretion by the thyroid shifts the equilibrium between free and bound T4 toward an increase in thyroxine binding globulin (TBG)-bound hormone. Concomitantly, the concentration of unbound TBG falls. Hence, the radioactive T3 in the resin T3 uptake test would preferentially bind to the resin and resin uptake would be increased.

Spirometry measures the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of a large breath. Spirometry also measures the forced vital capacity (FVC) which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a whole large breath. Normally at least 70% of the FVC comes out in the first second (i.e. the FEV1/FVC ratio is >70%). In COPD, FEV1 is reduced and hence FEV1/FVC ratio is less than normal, (i.e. FEV/FVC ratio is With worsening disease severity, lung volumes may increase resulting in an increase in total lung capacity, functional residual capacity and residual volume. In emphysema, diffusing capacity may be reduced, reflecting the parenchymal destruction characteristic of the disease. An x-ray of the chest may show an over-expanded lung (hyperinflation). A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the chest may show the distribution of emphysema throughout the lungs. A blood sample taken from an aery can be tested for blood gas levels which may show low oxygen levels (hypoxemia) and/or high carbon dioxide levels (respiratory acidosis). A blood sample taken from a vein may show a high blood count (reactive polythycaemia), a reaction to long-term hypoxemia.",

AIDS and HIV Infection with HIV-1 is associated with a progressive decrease of the CD4+ T cell count and an increase in viral load, the level of HIV in the blood. The stage of infection can be determined by measuring the patient's CD4+ T cell count and viral load. The stages of HIV infection are acute infection (also known as primary infection), latency and AIDS. Acute infection lasts for several weeks and may include symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, rash, myalgia, malaise, and mouth and esophageal sores. The latency stage involves few or no symptoms and can last anywhere from two weeks to twenty years or more, depending on the individual. AIDS, the final stage of HIV infection, is defined by low CD4+ T cell counts (fewer than 200 per microliter), various oppounistic infections, cancers and other conditions. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level of 200 cells per uL, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and infections with a variety of oppounistic microbes appear. The first symptoms often include moderate and unexplained weight loss, recurring respiratory tract infections (such as sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis media, pharyngitis), prostatitis, skin rashes, and oral ulcerations. Common oppounistic infections and tumors, most of which are normally controlled by robust CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity then sta to affect the patient. Typically, resistance is lost early on to oral Candida species and to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which leads to an increased susceptibility to oral candidiasis (thrush) and tuberculosis. Later, reactivation of latent herpes viruses may cause worsening recurrences of herpes simplex eruptions, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus-induced B-cell lymphomas, or Kaposi's sarcoma. Pneumonia caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii is common and often fatal. In the final stages of AIDS, infection with cytomegalovirus (another herpes virus) or Mycobacterium avium complex is more prominent.",

HIV infects T cells that carry CD4 antigen on their surface i.e CD4 T cells.In addition HIV can also affect macrophages that bear CD4 on their surface. The first step in the HIV infection is the binding of envelope glycoprotein of HIV to the CD4 receptor on the T cells/macrophages.How ever this interaction alone is not sufficient for entry and infection of the virus. It needs a second receptor i.e a co-receptor.HIV has two coreceptors- CCR5 CXCR4. Therefore HIV must bind to CD4 receptor and one of the above coreceptor to enter into the cell. Any damage to these coreceptors will prevent HIV from entering the cell, thus leading to resistance to HIV infection. A well known example is a mutation of CCR5 which is called delta 32 mutation. Those persons with this mutation is resistant to HIV infection because HIV virus cannot bind to this mutated CCR5 and therefore cannot enter the cell.",

Thyroid peroxidase catalyses the conversion of iodide ions into organic iodine and couples it with tyrosine to form MIT and DIT. This later step is inhibited by thionamides such as carbimazole. DIT and MIT combine forming T4 and T3. The organification of iodide and coupling of iodinated tyrosine molecules occurs on the surface of thyroglobulin. This is subsequently cleaved, releasing thyroid hormone. Uncoupled iodinated tyrosine can be dehalogenated, allowing recycling of the iodine.

This distinction has been challenged by molecular evidence from TB-endemic areas indicating that a large percentage of cases of adult pulmonary TB result from recent infection (either primary infection or reinfection) and not from reactivation.\u00a0\nPrimary Disease: Primary pulmonary TB occurs soon after the initial infection with tubercle bacilli. It may be asymptomatic or may present with fever and occasionally pleuritic chest pain. In areas of high TB transmission, this form of disease is often seen in children. Because most inspired air is distributed to the middle and lower lung zones, these areas are most commonly involved in primary TB. The lesion forming after initial infection (Ghon focus) is usually peripheral and accompanied by transient hilar or paratracheal lymphadenopathy, which may or may not be visible on standard chest radiography (CXR). Some patients develop erythema nodosum on the legs\u00a0or phlyctenular conjunctivitis. In the majority of cases, the lesion heals spontaneously and becomes evident only as a small calcified nodule. Pleural reaction overlying a subpleural focus is also common. The Ghon focus, with or without overlying pleural reaction, thickening, and regional lymphadenopathy, is referred to as the Ghon complex.\u00a0\nPleural effusion, which is found in up to two-thirds of cases, results from the penetration of bacilli into the pleural space from an adjacent subpleural focus. In severe cases, the primary site rapidly enlarges, its central portion undergoes necrosis, and cavitation develops (progressive\u00a0primary TB). TB in young children is almost invariably accompanied.\nReference: Harrison\u2019s P R I N C I P L E S\u00a0 \u00a0O F I N T E R N A L M E D I C I N E 20th edition page no 2008",

'The measurement of cTnT and cTnl (cardiac specific Troponin T & I) is of considerable diagnostic usefulness and they are now the preferred biochemical markers for MI' CK-MB isoenzvme is not a sensitive marker for AM I in Athletes The MB isoenzyme of CK has the advantage over total CK that it is not present in significant concentration in extracardiac tissue and therefore is considerably more specific. CK-MB rises within 4-8 hr after Acute MI and elevated CK-MB is accepted as a sensitive marker for diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction in healthy individuals. Individuals who train for long distance races (Athletes like marathan runners) however have been observed to have very high resting concentration of CK-MB in skeletal muscles. This may be owing to an adaptation by the athelete to produce a higher relative content of CKMB within skeletal muscles themselves. Studies of CK-MB levels in trained marathan runners have reveaked that total CK and percentage of MB isoenzyme is asymptomatic runners have been comparable to levels of CK and CKMB in patients with myocardial Infarction. Because of nonspecificity of CKMB fraction in runners (atheles) the measurement of this isoenzyme is of little value in making an early diagnosis of myocardial injury in athelets.

Low Erythropoetin levels, Thrombocytosis and increased LAP scores are all minor criteria for diagnosis of polycythemia Vera. JAK-2 Mutation and Polycythemia Vera JAK-2 is a member of an evolutionarily well conserved, non receptor tyrosine kinase family and serves as the cognate tyrosine kinase for the erythropoietin receptors A mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK-2 appears to have a central role in the pathogenesis of PV by causing constitutive activation of the kinase The presence of JAK -2 mutation thus allows for the exclusion of a reactive erythrocytosis. The 2001 WHO criteria for diagnosis of PV were however developed prior to the discovery of this impoant mutation and hence revised WHO criteria have been developed that include presence of JAK-2 mutation as a major criterion for diagnosis of PV Note : Although presence of JAK-2 mutation is a major criterion for diagnosis of PV, the presence of JAK-2 mutation alone is not diagnostic of PV. JAK-2 mutations may also be seen in other myeloproliferative disorders such as Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) and Chronic Idiopathic Myelojlbrosis (CIMF).
