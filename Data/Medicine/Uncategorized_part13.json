Ventrolateral cordotomy (surgical procedure of ablating selected pain conducting tracts) of the Left Spinothalamic Tract should effectively relieve pain from the right lower extremity. Ventrolateral Cordotomy Ventrolateral cordotomy is a surgical procedures in which the spinal anterolateral ascending system, for transmission of nociception (pain) known as the spinothalamic tract is interrupted for the relief of severe, intractible pain (cancer pain) not responding to any other conventional measures of pain control. Ventrolateral cordotomy can be performed by both, percutaneous and open surgical techniques. Ventrolateral cordotomy has been shown to be most effective in the treatment of intermittent shooting pain and evoked pain such as allodynia and hyperpathia, which is essentially mediated by the Lateral Spinothalamic Tract. The optimal candidate for such a procedure is a patient with unilateral severe pain (usually with malignant cancer) not adequately treated with less invasive measures. Fibres carrying sensation of 'pain' decussate (cross obliquely) to the opposite side within the spinal cord (over one to five segments) and ascend in the contralateral white column as the Lateral spinothalamic Tract. The Left spinothalamic tract carries sensation of pain from the Right side of the body. Cordotomy (ventrolateral) therefore aims to interrupt the lateral spinothalamic tract ascending contralaterallv to the painful side.

The mainstay of treatment in acute gouty ahritis is the administration of anti inflammatory drugs such as NSAID, Cochicine and /or glucocoicoids. Allopurinol should not be staed immediately in Acute attack of Gout Allopurinol should never be staed in acute gout as it may actually precipitate an acute attack. Anti inflammatory drugs such as NSAIDs are the drugs of choice in acute gout. Joint aspirate typically reveals strongly negative birefringent needle shaped crystals Definitive diagnosis of gout requires aspiration of the involved joint and demonstration of intracellular monosodium urate crystals in synol fluid. Under polarized light these are demonstrated as \"strongly negative birefringent needle shaped crystals.\" Tophi are aggregates of monosodium urate monohydrate crystals that form in extra aicular and aicular structures and cause deformity and destruction of hard and soft tissue. Serum uric acid levels may be normal in Acute Gout Gout is caused whenever; synol fluid is supersaturated with uric acid, irrespective of serum concentration of uric acid. The serum levels of uric acid can be normal or even low at the time of an attack and hence its determination is not diagnostic for gout. `Serum uric acid levels may be normal or low at the time of an acute attack, as inflammatory cytokines can be uricosuric and effective initiation of hypourecemic therapy can precipitate attacks. This limits the value of serum uric acid determination for the diagnosis of gout '- Harrison's 18th/2838",

Patients are irritable, restless weak and lethargic Some have high pitched cry and hyperpnea. Ale patient are very thirsty.

Complication of hypernatremia :? Brain hemorrhage is the most devastating consequence of hypernatremia. As the extracellular osmolarity increases water moves out of brain cells, resulting in decrease in brain volume. This can result in tearing of intra cerebral veins and bridging vessels as the brain moves away from the skull and the meninges. Patient may have subarachnoid, subdural and parenchymal hemorrhage. Seizure and coma are possible sequale of the hemorrhage even though seizures are more common during t/t.

Mechanism of veical transmission include infection after rupture of the membranes and direct contact of the fetus with infected secretions of blood from the maternal genital tract. Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNI) used to treat HIV-1 infection and AIDS. It target the reverse transcriptase enzyme, an essential viral enzyme which transcribes viral RNA into DNA. Nevirapine is not effective against HIV-2, as the pocket of the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase has a different structure, which confers intrinsic resistance to the NNI class. Adverse effects The most common adverse effect of nevirapine is the development of mild or moderate rash (13%). Severe or life-threatening skin reactions have been observed in 1.5% of patients, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity. Drug interactions Significant lowering of nevirapine levels occurs with the anti-tuberculosis drug, rifampicin. Nevirapine is an inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. It reduces the levels of several co-administered drugs including the antiretrovirals eirenz, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, as well as clarithromycin, ketoconazole, forms of hormonal contraception, and methadone. Preventing mother-to-child transmission A single dose of nevirapine given to both mother and child reduced the rate of HIV transmission by almost 50% compared with a very sho course of zidovudine (AZT) prophylaxis.(This 50% is the comparative reduction of HIV transmission between the two drugs) Zidovudine administered during pregnancy and labor and to the newborn reduces the risk of veical transmission by 70%.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Wrist and hand Ankylosing spondylitis (marie - strumpell disease) Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the sacroiliac joints and the axial skeleton. Prototype of seronegative (absence of rheumatoid factor) spondyloahropathies. Inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. Male to female ratio is 2-3 : 1 Strong correlation with HLA-B27 90-95% of cases are positive for HLA - B27. Joints involved in ankylosing spondylitis Primarily affects axial skeleton. The disease usually begins in the sacro-iliac joints and usually extends upwards to involve the lumbar, thoracic, and often cervical spine In the worst cases the hips or shoulders are also affected. o Hip joint is the most commonly affected peripheral joint. o Rarely knee and ankle are also involved. Pathology Enthesitis i.e. inflammation of the inseion points of tendons, ligaments or joint capsule on bone is one of the hallmarks of this entity of disease. Primarily affects axial (spinal) skeleton and sacroiliitis is often the earliest manifestation of A.S.. Involvement of costoveebral joints frequently occur, leading to diminished chest expansion (normal 5 cm) Peripheral joints e.g. shoulders, and hips are also involved in 1/3rd patients. Extraaicular manifestations like acute anterior uveitis (in 5%); rarely aoic valve disease, carditis and pulmonary fibrosis also occur. Pathological changes proceed in three stages? Inflammation with granulation tissue formation and erosion of adjacent bone. Fibrosis of granulation tissue Ossification of the fibrous tissue, leading to ankylosis of the joint. Inflammatory bowel disease (CD, UC) may also be seen. Clinicalfeatures (symptoms) Low back pain of insidious onset Duration usually less than 3 months Significant morning stiffness and improvement with exercise Limited chest expansion Diffuse tenderness over the spine and sacroiliac joints Loss of lumbar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis Decreased spinal movements (especially extension) in all directions. Radiological features of an kvlasing spondylitis Radiographic evidence of sacroiliac joint is the most consistent finding in ankylosing spondylitis and is crucial for diagnosis. The findings are :- D Sclerosis of the aiculating surfaces of SI joints Widening of the sacroiliac joint space Bony ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints Calcification of the sacroiliac ligament and sacro-tuberous ligaments Evidence of enthesopathy - calcification at the attachment of the muscles, tendons and ligaments, paicularly around the pelvis and around the heel. X-ray of lumbar spine may show :- Li Squaring of veebrae : The normal anterior concavity of the veebral body is lost because of calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament. Loss of the lumbar lordosis. Bridging 'osteophytes' (syndesmophytes) Bamboo spine appearance In the early disease process, plain x-rays may be read as normal. More accurate and early diagnosis can be done by using MR1 and/or CT scan. Dynamic MRI with fat saturation, either sho tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequnece or TI weighted images with contrast enhancement is highly sensitive and specific for identifying early intra-aicular inflammation, cailage changes, and underlying bone marrow edema in sacroilitis. Magnetic resonance imaging allows for visualization of acute sacroilitis, spondylitis, and spondylodiscitis, and can also detect acute inflammation of the entheses, bone and synovium. The ability to detect early inflammatiion and acurately visualize cailaginous and enthesal lesions makes magnetic resonance imaging a useful assessment tool in the spondyloahropathies.",

Oedema and ascites occur late in the disease. Anginal chest pain may occur due to exeional myocardial hypoperfusion in the setting of right ventricular hyperophy, left main coronary aery compression by the pulmonary aery, or ischaemic hea disease. Patients are prone to tachyarrhythmias, most commonly atrial flutter, which can cause sudden decompensation. Haemoptysis, although uncommon, can occur in Eisenmenger's syndrome and CTEPH, where bronchial aeries may be enlarged. Signs suggestive of pulmonary hypeension include a loud pulmonary second hea sound, systolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation, raised jugular venous pressure, peripheral oedema and ascites, but these signs may be subtle or absent in early disease.

Other prominent skin manifestations include : Pruritus in the early stages Edema in the early stages Sclerodactyly Digital ulcers Pitting at the fingeips Telangiectasia Calcinosis cutis Radiographs of the hands may reveal Soft tissue calcifications (calcinosis cutis). Resorption of the distal phalangeal tufts (acro-osteolysis). Less common radiographic findings are : Aicular erosions Joint space narrowing Demineralization The symptoms of the female and presence of antinuclear antibody points towards the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis. It is a case of systemic sclerosis or scleroderma. The clues to the diagnosis of scleroderma are : Sclerodactyly Raynaud's phenomenon Dysphagia Presence of antinuclear antibody Though systemic sclerosis is a multisystem disease, the two most distinguishing features of systemic sclerosis are: o Striking cutaneous changes Notable skin thickening. This is the most easily recognized manifestation of scleroderma. Raynaud's phenomenon This is the first manifestation of disease in almost every patients. Dysphagia Attributable to esophageal fibrosis and its resultant hypomotlity is present in more than 50% of patients. Remember, Whenever skin thickening is present along with Raynaud's phenomenon, it is almost always a case of scleroderma\". These two features are not present in any other multisystem disease whose clinical features overlap with that of systemic sclerosis e.g. SLE, rheumatoid ahritis, inflammatory myopathy, Sjogren syndrome\". Although skin changes and Raynaud's phenomenon are the major diagnostic clues, scleroderma is a multisystem disease that most commonly targets peripheral circulation, muscles, joints, gastrointestinal tract, lung, hea and kidney. So, the symptoms encountered in early presentation of scleroderma include musculoskeletal discomfo, fatigue, weight loss, and hea burn and dysphagia associated with gastroesophageal reflex disease (GERD). When these symptoms are accompanied by the skin thickness and Raynaud c phenomenon, diagnosis ofscleroderma should be considered. Role of autoantibodies in the diagnosis of scleroderma Autoantibodies are found in nearly every patient with scleroderma (sensitivity >95%), but they are not specific for scleroderma0. Scleroderma is associated with wide array of autoantibodies. Two ANA'S which are more or less unique to scleroderma are: Antitopoisomerase antibody (20-40%) Seen in patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis Patients with this autoantibody are more likely to havepulmonary .fibrosis and peripheral vascular disease Patients with these autoantibodies have poor prognosis Anticentromere antibody (20-40%) These autoantibodies are seen in patients with limited systemic sclerosis",

        "exp": "Pituitary adenomas are most commonest cause of pituitary hormone hypersecretion and hyposecretion syndromes, common in adults. Hyperprolactinemia is the most common pituitary hormone hypersecretion syndrome in both men and women. PRL-secreting pituitary adenomas (prolactinomas) are the most common cause of PRL levels >200microgram/L. Pituitary adenomas are a result of excessive secretion of prolactin, inhibiting hypothalamic release of LHRH resulting in defective LH and FSH secretion. This defective LH and FSH secretion results in decreased levels of estrogen in females and testosterone in males. This is a reason how excessive prolactin can cause hypogonadism. In men with hyperprolactinemia, diminished libido, infeility, and visual loss (from optic nerve compression) are the usual presenting symptoms. Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infeility are the hallmarks of hyperprolactinemia in women. If hyperprolactinemia develops before menarche, primary amenorrhea results. Basal, fasting morning PRL levels (normally <20micrograms/L) should be measured to assess hypersecretion.the diagnosis of prolactinoma is likely with a PRL level >200 micrograms/L. PRL levels <100micrograms/L may be caused by microadenomas. MRI should be performed in all patients with hyperprolactinemia. Dopamine agonists are effective for most causes of hyperprolactinemia. An ergoline derivative, cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine agonist with high D2 receptor affinity. The drug effectively suppresses PRL for >14 days after a single oral dose and induces prolactinoma shrinkage in most patients. The ergot alkaloid bromocriptine mesylate is a dopamine receptor agonist that suppresses prolactin secretion. Indications for surgical adenoma debulking include dopamine resistance or intolerance and the presence of an invasive macroadenoma with compromised vision that fails to improve after drug treatment.

It excluded the Hodgkin lymphomas and divided the remaining lymphomas into four grades (Low, Intermediate, High, and Miscellaneous) related to prognosis, with some fuher subdivisions based on the size and shape of affected cells. This purely histological classification included no information about cell surface markers, or genetics, and it made no distinction between T-cell lymphomas or B-cell lymphomas. The working formulation was widely accepted at the time of its publication but is now obsolete. It was superseded by subsequent classifications but it is still used by cancer agencies for compilation of lymphoma statistics and historical comparisons.",

The typical presentation is as illustrated in the question stem. The deficiency may involve either or both IgG2 and IgG3 with or without IgG4 deficiency. (IgG1 is the major form, and its deficiency leads to a deficiency of total IgG, and so, by definition, it is not considered a \"subclass\" deficiency.) A potentially clinically impoant point is that some patients with IgG2 deficiency also have IgA deficiency and may develop anaphylaxis if given IgA-containing blood products. C3 deficiency tends to produce pyogenic infections. C4 deficiency tends to produce an SLE-like syndrome.

The net result is greatly decreased extracellular fluid volume. Fuhermore, hyponatremia!, hyperkalemiae and mild acidosise develop because of failure of potassium and hydrogen ions to be secreted in exchange for sodium reabsorption Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) Glucocoicoid deficiency Fatigue, lack of energy o Weight loss, anorexia o Myalgia, joint pain Fever Anemia, lymphocytosis, eosinophilia Slightly increased TSH (due to loss of feedback inhibition of TSH release) Hypoglycemia (more frequent in children) Low blood pressure, postural hypotension oHyponatremia (due to loss of feedback inhibition of AVP release) Mineralocoicoid deficiency Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting Dizziness , postural hypotension Salt craving Low blood pressure, postural hypotension Increased serum creatinine (due to volume depletion) Hyponatremiayperkalemia deficiency Lack of energy Dry and itchy skin (in women) Loss of libido (in women) o Loss of axillary and pubic hair (in women) Symptoms Hyperpigmentation (primary Al only) oAlabaster-colored pale skin (secondary Al only) (due to deficiency of POMC-derived peptides) REMEMBER The clinical features and laboratory features described above are characteristically seen only in primary addison's disease because in primary addison's disease both aldosterone and glucocoicoid are deficient, whereas In secondary addison's disease only glucocoicoid deficiency is seen. ALSO KNOW The basis for acute adrenal deficiency or addisonian crisis During conditions of physical or mental stress, large amount of glucocoicoids are secreted to cope up with the situation. But in persons with addison:s. disease, the output of glucocoicoids does not increase during stress. Thus the deficiency of glucocoicoids, when a person actually has acute need for the excessive amount of glucocoicoids produces addisonian crisis. The manifestations are produced due to extracellular fluid dehydration and low blood volume leading to circulatory shock.",

Hydrocoisone is the preferred steroid fir Glucocoicoid replacement therapy in acute adrenal crisis since it has both glucocoicoid and mineralocoicoid actions. In cases where the diagnosis of acute adrenal insufficiency is suspected (not confirmed) Dexamethasone is preferred as the initial steroid of choice because Dexamethasone does not compete with the coisol assay. 'Glucocoicoid replacement should be initiated by bolus injection of 100 mg Hydrocoisone, followed by the administration of 100-200mg hydrocoisone over 24 hours either by continuous infusion or provided by several IV or IM Injections. Mineralocoicoid replacement can be initiated once the daily hydrocoisone dose has been reduced to less than 50 mg because at higher doses hydrocoisone provides sufficient stimulation of glucocoicoid receptors'",

        "question": "With regards to G6PD deficiency, which of the following in false",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., X-linked recessive disorder that does not affect heterozygous famales Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, an X-linked disorder, is the most common enzymatic disorder of red blood cells in humans, affecting 400 million people worldwide. Clinical spectrum The clinical expression of G6PD variants encompasses a spectrum of hemolytic syndromes The four forms of symptomatic G6PD deficiency : Acute hemolytic anemia Favism Congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia G6PD deficiency is expressed in males carrying a variant gene that results in sufficient enzyme deficiency to lead to symptoms. Acute hemolytic anemia Almost all individuals with the most prevalent G6PD variants, G6PD A- and G6PD Mediterranean, are asymptomatic in the steady state. They have neither anemia, evidence of increased red cell destruction, nor an alteration in blood morphology,. o However sudden destruction of enzyme deficient erythrocytes can be triggered by ceain drugs or chemicals, by selected infections, and rarely by metabolic abnormalities (eg, diabetic ketoacidosis). Clinical course At two to four days after drug ingestion, there is the sudden onset of jaundice, pallor, and dark urine, with or without abdominal and back pain. This is associated with an abrupt fall in the hemoglobin concentration of 3 to 4 g/dL, during which time the peripheral blood smear reveals red cell fragments, microspherocytes, and eccentrocytes or \"bite\" cells. The anemia induces an appropriate stimulation of erythropoiesis, characterized by an increase in reticulocytes that is apparent within five days and is maximal at 7 to 10 days after the onset of hemolysis. Even with continued drug exposure, the acute hemolytic process ends after about one week, with ultimate reversal of the anemia. Inciting events Patients with class II or III variants develop intermittent hemolysis only after one or more of the following inciting events. Infection Oxidant drugs Chemical agents (eg, moth balls, aniline dyes, henna compounds) Diabetic ketoacidosis Ingestion of a beans Drugs and chemicals Primaquine, dapsone, and a number of other drugs can precipitate hemolysis in G6PD deficient subjects. Foods: a beans and bitter melon G6PD deficiency can also be precipitated by the the ingestion of fresh a beans (ism). Manifestation ofism begins 5-24 hrs after a bean ingestion and include headache, nausea, back pain. Congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia Patients with class I G6PD variants have such severe G6PD deficiency that lifelong hemolysis occurs in the absence of infection or drug exposure. Such patients fall under the category of having congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. These G6PD variants have low in vitro activity and/or marked instability of the molecule, and most have DNA mutations at the glucose-6-phosphate or NADP binding sites. These sites are central to the function of G6PD, which oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate and reduces NADP to NADPH. It is presumed that the functional defect is so severe that the red cells cannot withstand even the normal oxidative stresses encountered in the circulation. Anemia and jaundice are often first noted in the newborn period, and the degree of hyperbilirubinemia is frequently of sufficient severity to require exchange transfusion. After infancy, hemolytic manifestations are subtle and inconstant. Most individuals have mild to moderate anemia (hemoglobin 8 to 10 g/dL) with a reticulocyte count of 10 to 15 percent. Pallor is uncommon, scleral icterus is intermittent, splenomegaly is rare, and splenectomy generally is of little benefit. Hemolysis can be exaggerated by exposure to drugs or chemicals with oxidant potential or exposure to a beans. Some drugs with relatively mild oxidant potential that are safe in patients with class II or class III G6PD variants may increase hemolysis in patients with class I variants. Neonatal hyperbilirubineinia The clinical picture of neonatal jaundice due to G6PD deficiency differs from neonatal jaundice seen in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) associated with Rh(D) incompatibility in two main respects. G6PD deficiency-related neonatal jaundice is rarely present at bih; the peak incidence of clinical onset is between days two and three. a There is more jaundice than anemia, and the anemia is rarely severe. The severity ofjaundice varies widely, from being subclinical to imposing the threat of kernicterus if not treated",

This infection is caused by the protozoa Ehistolytica, which ascends the poal venous system. The right lobe (posterior superior quadrant) of the liver is more commonly affected than the left lobe. This has been attributed to the fact that the right lobe is supplied predominantly by the superior mesenteric vein, whereas the left lobe is supplied by the splenic vein. Histologic Findings of abscess The abscess contains acellular proteinaceous debris and is surrounded by a rim of amebic trophozoites invading tissue. The abscess contains a chocolate-colored fluid that resembles anchovy paste and consists predominantly of necrotic hepatocytes. Complications Pleuropulmonary infection is the most common complication. Cardiac involvement results following the rupture of an abscess involving the left lobe of the liver.

It is conjugated with uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronic acid by the enzyme bilirubin UDP-glucuronyl transferase (B-UGT). Conjugated bilirubin is directed toward the canalicular membrane, and it is transpoed into the bile canaliculus by an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent pump.

Cases of high clinical probability combined with a high probability V/Q scan are viually diagnostic of Pulmonary Embolism (Philip A Karla 3rd edition). Lung scanning is a second-line diagnostic test for PE, used mostly for patients who cannot tolerate intravenous contrast. Perfusion scan is done by injecting small paiculate aggregates of albumin labeled with a gamma-emitting radionuclide. Ventilation scans, are obtained using radiolabelled inhaled gas such as xenon or krypton. When the V/P scan shows 2 or more segmental perfusion defects in presence of normal ventilation it is said to e a high probability scan.

Urinalysis is useful in suspected renal colic and pyelonephritis. An erect chest X-ray may show air under the diaphragm, suggestive of perforation, and a plain abdominal film may show evidence of obstruction or ileus. An abdominal ultrasound may help if gall stones or renal stones are suspected. Ultrasonography is also useful in the detection of free fluid and any possible intra-abdominal abscess. Contrast studies, by either mouth or anus, are useful in the further evaluation of intestinal obstruction and essential in the differentiation of pseudo-obstruction from mechanical large-bowel obstruction. Other investigations commonly used include CT (seeking evidence of pancreatitis, retroperitoneal collections or masses, including an aortic aneurysm or renal calculi) and angiography (mesenteric ischaemia).\nDiagnostic laparotomy should be considered, when the diagnosis has not been revealed by other investigations. All patients must be carefully and regularly re-assessed (every 2-4 hours) so that any change in condition that might alter both the suspected diagnosis and clinical decision can be observed and acted on early.\u00a0\nKey Concept: \nSometimes, renal stones are not evident in ultrasonography, if these are small in size.

Kussmaul's sign suggests impaired filling of the right ventricle due to either fluid in the pericardial space or a poorly compliant myocardium or pericardium. This impaired filling causes the increased blood flow to back up into the venous system, causing the jugular distension. Causes of Kussmaul's sign: The differential diagnosis generally associated with Kussmaul's sign is constrictive pericarditis, along with restrictive cardiomyopathy and cardiac tamponade.

The mutation is detected in the tyrosine kinase proto-oncogene RET and can be identified in 98% of affected family members with appropriate screening. Also know: 6% of patients with sporadic medullary thyroid cancer carry a germline RET mutation. Genetic testing should, thus, be offered to all patients with newly diagnosed apparent sporadic disease. MEN 2B patients tend to exhibit more locally aggressive MTC , and screening with RET testing is recommended at age 6 months or prior; for familial MTC and MEN 2A screening is recommended by 5 years of age.

Although coarctation of aoa does not commonly present with seizures, these may be seen as a consequence of severe hypeension (BP = 200/140) or complications like intracranial haemorrhage (from Berry aneurysms which are more common in patients with coarctation. Coarctation of Aoa is the most likely diagnosis: Approach (Nelson/Hurst) The classic sign of coarctation of aoa is a disparity in pulsations and blood pressure in arms and legs. The femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses are weak (or absent in upto 40% of patients) in contrast to bounding pulses in the arms and carotid vessels. The blood pressure is the legs is lower than in the arms and 90% of patients with coarctation have hypeension in an upper extremity greater than 95\" perecentile for age Age (yrs) 95th percentile (mm Hg) > 1 yrs 110 60 I -- 5 yrs 115 /75 6-10 yrs 125 /85 11 -- 18 yrs 140 /90 A blood pressure of 200 /140 mm Hg in a 10 year old boy suggests severe hypeension (95\" percentile at 10 years -- 125/85) Severe hypeension may be seen as a consequence of persistant hypeension in an individual who has not undergone corrective surgery for coarctation, and this usually appears in the second or third decade of life (Hurst) Children with severe/malignant hypeension may develop headaches, seizures and stroke (haemorrhage from Berry aneurysms which are more common in patients with coarctation). Takayasu Aooaeritis may also present with severe hypeension and absent femoral pulses due to acquired midaoic coarctation but this is an uncommon presentation in Takavasu aooaeritis (and hence not the single best answer of choice) Takayasu aeritis (or non specific aooaeritis) is a chronic vasculitis disease of medium and large sized aeries with a strong predilection for aoic arch and its branches. This may lead to stenosis of the involved vessels and hence a picture of acquired coarctation. It may thus produce a clinical picture similar to that of coarctation with disparity in pulsations and blood pressure in arms & legs with hypeension depending on the site of the acquired stenosis. However, this condition is more common in women and most commonly affects the subclavican aery. Hence it more commonly presents with claudication, along with unequal and reduced pulses / BP in the upper extremity than the lower extremity. Also systemic symptoms are more common is Takayasu than in coarctation. Neveheless Takayasu aeritis may affect the Thoracic or Abdominal aoa and present with absent lower limb pulses and upper extremity hypeension like coarctation of aoa.

Early liver failure may be suspected based on isolated prolongation of the Prothrombin Time (PT).

TTE is the standard test for the noninvasive evaluation of pericardial disease. Identification of vegetations on tricuspid valves is no better overall by TEE than by TEE (as the tricuspid valve is equidistant from the chest wall and the esophagus). Very anterior masses, Such as left ventricular apical thrombi, are equally well and, far more easily imaged by TTE. Trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) vs. Trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) Trans-esophageal Echocardiography (TEE) is generally more sensitive than Trans-thoracic Echocardiography (TTE) and provides a unique window for high resolution imaging of posterior structures of the hea paicularly the left atrium, mitral valve and aoa. TEE is however an invasive and more expensive procedure and hence its indications must be weighed against these factors and TTE remains the initial investigation of choice for most situations. However if a high clinical index of suspicion remains after a negative or non-diagnostic transthoracic study, Trans-esophageal echocardiography should be considered.

Loss of storage capacity of stomach and ablation, by pass or destruction of pylorus, results in rapid emptying of hyperostnolar chyme into duodenummm and small intestine. Extracellular fluid then shifts into the intestinal lumen to restore isotonicity resulting in decreased intravascular volume, which gives rise to the vasomotor symptoms. Note that while reduced gastric capacity contributes, option (b) is a more accurate answer. Dumping Syndrome is actually of two types: Early dumping syndrome (as described above) Late dumping syndrome: This is Reactive hypoglvcemiae. The carbohydrate load in thesmall intestine later causes a rise in plasma glucose, which in turn causes insulin levels to rise causing a secondary hypoglycemia.",
