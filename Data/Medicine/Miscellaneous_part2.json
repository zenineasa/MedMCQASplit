        "exp": "Sleep apnea is characterized by paial or complete cessation of breathing during night-time sleep, resulting in repeated arousal from sleep, oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and daytime sleepiness. Apnea is defined as complete cessation of airflow for >10 s (Table I).3 Hypopnea, a paial cessation of airflow, is defined as a 50% to 90% reduction in airflow for >10 s, accompanied by a >3% decrease in oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) and terminated by electroencephalographic arousal.4 The 3 types of apnea are central, obstructive, and mixed. Central sleep apnea (CSA) is characterized by a complete withdrawal of central respiratory drive to the inspiratory muscles, including the diaphragm, and results in the simultaneous absence of naso-oral airflow and thoracoabdominal excursions. In OSA, the thoracic inspiratory muscles, including the diaphragm, are active, so thoracoabdominal excursions are seen. Absence of airflow results from upper-airway occlusion caused by lost pharyngeal dilator muscle tone, with consequent pharyngeal collapse. Mixed apnea has an initial central component followed by an obstructive component. Like apnea, hypopnea can also be obstructive or central. We focus here on obstructive causes. Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep-related breathing disorder that has a major impact on cardiovascular function. It has been associated with hypeension, coronary aery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and hea failure. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 538",

        "exp": "Management of sarcoidosis Patients who present with acute illness and erythema nodosum should receive NSAIDs and, on occasion, a sho course of glucocoicoids. The majority of patients enjoy spontaneous remission and so, if there is no evidence of organ damage, systemic glucocoicoid therapy can be withheld for 6 months. However, prednisolone (at a staing dose of 20-40 mg/day) should be commenced immediately in the presence of hypercalcaemia, pulmonary impairment, renal impairment and uveitis. Topical glucocoicoids may be useful in cases of mild uveitis, and inhaled glucocoicoids have been used to shoen the duration of systemic glucocoicoid use in asymptomatic parenchymal sarcoid. Patients should be warned that strong sunlight may precipitate hypercalcaemia and endanger renal function. Features suggesting a less ourable outlook include age over 40, Afro-Caribbean ethnicity, persistent symptoms for more than 6 months, the involvement of more than three organs, lupus pernio and a stage III/IV chest X-ray. In patients with severe disease, methotrexate (10-20 mg/week), azathioprine (50-150 mg/day) and specific tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) inhibitors have been effective. Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and low-dose thalidomide may be useful in cutaneous sarcoid with limited pulmonary involvement. Selected patients may be referred for consideration of single lung transplantation. The overall moality is low (1-5%) and usually reflects cardiac involvement or pulmonary fibrosis. ref - Davidsons 23e p608-610",

        "exp": "Horner's syndrome, also known as oculosympathetic paresis,is a combination of symptoms that arises when a group of nerves known as the sympathetic trunk is damaged. The signs and symptoms occur on the same side (ipsilateral) as it is a lesion of the sympathetic trunk. It is characterized by miosis (a constricted pupil), paial ptosis (a weak, droopy eyelid), apparent anhydrosis (decreased sweating), with apparent enophthalmos (inset eyeball) The nerves of the sympathetic trunk arise from the spinal cord in the chest, and from there ascend to the neck and face. The nerves are pa of the sympathetic nervous system, a division of the autonomic (or involuntary) nervous system. Once the syndrome has been recognized, medical imaging and response to paicular eye drops may be required to identify the location of the problem and the underlying cause Signs that are found in people with Horner's syndrome on the affected side of the face include the following: ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid) anhidrosis (decreased sweating) miosis (constriction of the pupil) sinking of the eyeball into the face inability to completely close or open the eyelid facial flushing headaches loss of ciliospinal reflex bloodshot conjunctiva, depending on the site of lesion. unilateral straight hair (in congenital Horner's syndrome); the hair on the affected side may be straight in some cases. heterochromia iridum (in congenital Horner's syndrome) Interruption of sympathetic pathways leads to several implications. It inactivates the dilator muscle and thereby produces miosis. It inactivates the superior tarsal muscle which produces ptosis. It reduces sweat secretion in the face. Patients may have apparent enophthalmos (affected eye looks to be slightly sunken in) but this is not the case. The ptosis from inactivation of the superior tarsal muscle causes the eye to appear sunken in, but when actually measured, enophthalmos is not present.

        "exp": "Sydenham chorea (SC) is a neurological disorder of childhood resulting from infection Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), the bacterium that causes rheumatic fever. SC is characterized by rapid, irregular, and aimless involuntary movements of the arms and legs, trunk, and facial muscles. Sydenham's chorea is characterized by the abrupt onset (sometimes within a few hours) of neurologic symptoms, classically chorea, usually affecting all four limbs. Other neurologic symptoms include behavior change, dysahria, gait disturbance, loss of fine and gross motor control with resultant deterioration of handwriting, headache, slowed cognition, facial grimacing, fidgetiness and hypotonia. Also, there may be tongue fasciculations (\"bag of worms\") and a \"milk sign\", which is a relapsing grip demonstrated by alternate increases and decreases in tension, as if hand milking. Non-neurologic manifestations of acute rheumatic fever are carditis, ahritis, erythema marginatum, and subcutaneous nodules. The PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) syndrome is similar, but is not characterized by Sydenham's motor dysfunction. PANDAS presents with tics and/or a psychological component (e.g., OCD) and occurs much earlier, days to weeks after GABHS infection rather than 6-9 months later. It may be confused with other conditions such as lupus and Tourette syndrome. Movements cease during sleep, and the disease usually resolves after several months. Unlike in Huntington's disease, which is generally of adult onset and associated with an unremitting autosomal dominant movement disorder and dementia, neuroimaging in Sydenham's chorea is normal and other family members are unaffected. Other disorders that may be accompanied by chorea include abetalipoproteinemia, ataxia-telangiectasia, biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease, Fahr disease, familial dyskinesia-facial myokymia (Bird-Raskind syndrome) due to an ADCY5 gene mutation, glutaric aciduria, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, mitochondrial disorders, Wilson disease, hypehyroidism, lupus erythematosus, pregnancy (chorea gravidarum), and side effects of ceain anticonvulsants or psychotropic agent Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 1025",

        "exp": "Antiphospholipid syndrome or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS or APLS), is an autoimmune, hypercoagulable state caused by antiphospholipid antibodies. APS provokes blood clots (thrombosis) in both aeries and veins as well as pregnancy-related complications such as miscarriage, stillbih, preterm delivery, and severe preeclampsia. The diagnostic criteria require one clinical event (i.e. thrombosis or pregnancy complication) and two antibody blood tests spaced at least three months apa that confirm the presence of either lupus anticoagulant or anti-b2-glycoprotein-I (since b2-glycoprotein-I antibodies are a subset of anti-cardiolipin antibodies, an anti-cardiolipin assay can be performed as a less specific proxy) Antiphospholipid syndrome can be primary or secondary. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome occurs in the absence of any other related disease. Secondary antiphospholipid syndrome occurs with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In rare cases, APS leads to rapid organ failure due to generalised thrombosis; this is termed \"catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome\" (CAPS or Asherson syndrome) and is associated with a high risk of death. Antiphospholipid syndrome often requires treatment with anticoagulant medication such as heparin to reduce the risk of fuher episodes of thrombosis and improve the prognosis of pregnancy. Warfarin/Coumadin is not used during pregnancy because it can cross the placenta, unlike heparin, and is teratogenic. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the absence of blood clots or pregnancy-related complications does not indicate APS (see below for the diagnosis of APS). Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause aerial or venous blood clots, in any organ system, or pregnancy-related complications. In APS patients, the most common venous event is deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities, and the most common aerial event is stroke. In pregnant women affected by APS, there is an increased risk of recurrent miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm bih.A frequent cause of such complications is placental infarctions. In some cases, APS seems to be the leading cause of mental and/or development retardation in the newborn, due to an aPL-induced inhibition of trophoblast differentiation. The antiphospholipid syndrome responsible for most of the miscarriages in later trimesters seen in concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy. Other common findings, although not pa of the APS classification criteria, are low platelet count, hea valve disease, and livedo reticularis. There are also associations between antiphospholipid antibodies and headaches, migraines, and oscillopsia.Some studies have shown the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood and spinal fluid of patients with psychological symptoms. Very few patients with primary APS go on to develop SLE. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 804",

Acute distal lower limb weakness occurs occasionally from an acute toxic polyneuropathy or cauda equina syndrome. Distal symmetric weakness usually develops over weeks, months, or years and is due to metabolic, toxic, hereditary, degenerative, or inflammatory diseases of peripheral nerves. Drugs that inhibit the enzyme AChE allow ACh to interact repeatedly with the limited number of AChRs, producing improvement in the strength of myasthenic muscles. Edrophonium is used most commonly for diagnostic testing because of the rapid onset (30 s) and short duration (about 5 min) of its effect. An objective endpoint must be selected to evaluate the effect of edrophonium. Examiner should focus on one or more unequivocally weak muscle groups and evaluate their strength objectively For example, weakness of extraocular muscles, impairment of speech, or the length of time that the patient can maintain the arms in forward abduction may be useful measures. An initial dose of 2 mg of edrophonium is given intravenously. If definite improvement occurs, the test is considered positive and is terminated. If there is no change, the patient is given an additional 8 mg intravenously. The dose is administered in two parts because some patients react to edrophonium with unpleasant sideeffects such as nausea, diarrhea, salivation, fasciculations, and rarely with severe symptoms of syncope or bradycardia.

Bupropion and varenicilineMost effective medications for smoking cessationNicotine replacementBupropionVareniclineo Transdermal nicotine patch o Nicotine gum o Nicotine lozenge o Nicotine inhaler o Nicotine nasal spray Nicotine replacement therapyo The goal of nicotine replacement therapy is to provide nicotine to a smoker without using tobacco, thereby relieving nicotine withdraw l symptoms as the smoker breaks the behaviour of cigarette smoking.o The use of nicotine replacement therapy in place of cigarette avoids exposure to carbon monoxide that reduces oxygen delivery to oxidant gases that are atherogenic and to tars that are carcinogenic.There are different types of nicotine replacement products e.g.Nicotine patch - transdermallyNasal spray - nasal mucosaNicotine chewing gum, lozenge or inhaler - oral mucosao Nicotine replacement products differ in their pharmacokinetics and delivery of nicotine to circulation# But no product delivers nicotine as rapidely as cigarette smoking, a factor that contributes specifically to dependence producing properties of cigarettes.Bupropiono It is believed to act by enhancing central nervous system noradrenergic and dopaminergic release,o It is given as sustained release formulation.o The sustained release bupropion takes five to seven days to reach steady state blood levels. Therefore it is started one week before a smoker s target quit date,o Bupropion monotherapy doubles the likelihood of smoking cessation compared to placebo.Varenicilineo Vareniciline is a partial agonist at the alpha-4 beta-2 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The receptor that appears to produce the reinforcing effects of nicotine and leads to nicotine dependence.It aids smoking cessation in two ways# Firstly, as a partial agonist it binds to and produces the partial stimulation of the alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic receptor thereby reducing the symptoms of nicotine withdrawl.# Secondly since vareniciline binds to the alpha 4 beta 2 receptor subunit with high affinity it blocks the nicotine in tobacco smoking from binding to the receptor.; there ????",

        "exp": "Paracentesisis a form of body fluid sampling procedure, generally referring to peritoneocentesis (also called laparocentesis or abdominal paracentesis) in which the peritoneal cavity is punctured by a needle to sample peritoneal fluid The procedure is used to remove fluid from the peritoneal cavity, paicularly if this cannot be achieved with medication. The most common indication is ascites that has developed in people with cirrhosis Indications It is used for a number of reasons: to relieve abdominal pressure from ascites to diagnose spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and other infections (e.g. abdominal TB) to diagnose metastatic cancer to diagnose blood in peritoneal space in trauma For ascites The procedure is often performed in a doctor's office or an outpatient clinic. In an expe's hands it is usually very safe, although there is a small risk of infection, excessive bleeding or perforating a loop of bowel. These last two risks can be minimized greatly with the use of ultrasound guidance. The patient is requested to urinate before the procedure; alternately, a Foley catheter is used to empty the bladder. The patient is positioned in the bed with the head elevated at 45-60 degrees to allow fluid to accumulate in lower abdomen. After cleaning the side of the abdomen with an antiseptic solution, the physician numbs a small area of skin and inses a large-bore needle with a plastic sheath 2 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) in length to reach the peritoneal (ascitic) fluid. The needle is removed, leaving the plastic sheath to allow drainage of the fluid. The fluid is drained by gravity, a syringe or by connection to a vacuum bottle. Several litres of fluid may be drained during the procedure; however, if more than two litres are to be drained it will usually be done over the course of several treatments. After the desired level of drainage is complete, the plastic sheath is removed and the puncture site bandaged. The plastic sheath can be left in place with a flow control valve and protective dressing if fuher treatments are expected to be necessary. If fluid drainage in cirrhotic ascites is more than 5 litres, patients may receive intravenous serum albumin (25% albumin, 8g/L) to prevent hypotension (low blood pressure).There has been debate as to whether albumin administration confers benefit, but recent reviews repo that it can reduce moality after large volume paracentesis significantly. The procedure generally is not painful and does not require sedation. The patient is usually discharged within several hours following post-procedure observation provided that blood pressure is otherwise normal and the patient experiences no dizziness.

        "exp": "Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease caused by excessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones. In advanced cases, skeletal fluorosis causes painful damage to bones and joints. Symptoms are mainly promoted in the bone structure. Due to a high fluoride concentration in the body, the bone is hardened and thus less elastic, resulting in an increased frequency of fractures. Other symptoms include thickening of the bone structure and accumulation of bone tissue, which both contribute to impaired joint mobility. Ligaments and cailage can become ossified.Most patients suffering from skeletal fluorosis show side effects from the high fluoride dose such as ruptures of the stomach lining and nausea. Fluoride can also damage the parathyroid glands, leading to hyperparathyroidism, the uncontrolled secretion of parathyroid hormones. These hormones regulate calcium concentration in the body. An elevated parathyroid hormone concentration results in a depletion of calcium in bone structures and thus a higher calcium concentration in the blood. As a result, bone flexibility decreases making the bone more susceptible to fractures As of now, there are no established treatments for skeletal fluorosis patients.However, it is reversible in some cases, depending on the progression of the disease. If fluorine intake is stopped, the amount in bone will decrease and be excreted urine. However, it is a very slow process to eliminate the fluorine from the body completely. Minimal results are seen in patients. Treatment of side effects is also very difficult. For example, a patient with a bone fracture cannot be treated according to standard procedures, because the bone is very brittle. In this case, recovery will take a very long time and a pristine healing cannot be guaranteed. However, fuher fluorosis can be prevented by drinking defluoridated water. It is recently suggested that drinking of defluoridated water from the ''calcium amended-hydroxyapatite'' defluoridation method may help in the fluorosis reversal.Defluoridated water from this suggested method provides calcium-enriched alkaline drinking water as generally fluoride contaminated water has a low amount of calcium mineral and drinking alkaline water helps in eliminating the toxic fluoride from the body Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 716",

HCC accounts for about 30% of all iron-related deaths in hemochromatosis.# Aflatoxin:> This hepatic carcinogen is a by-product of fungal contamination of foodstuffs in sub-Saharan Africa and East and Southeast Asia.

        "exp": "Prazosin is a medication primarily used to treat high blood pressure, symptoms of an enlarged prostate, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).It is a less preferred treatment of high blood pressure.Other uses may include hea failure and Raynaud syndrome.It is taken by mouth Common side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, and hea palpitations.Serious side effects may include low blood pressure with standing and depression.Prazosin is an a1-blocker.It works to decrease blood pressure by dilating blood vessels and helps with an enlarged prostate by relaxing the outflow of the bladder. How it works in PTSD is not entirely clear. Prazosin is orally active and has a minimal effect on cardiac function due to its alpha-1 receptor selectivity. When prazosin is staed, however, hea rate and contractility go up in order to maintain the pre-treatment blood pressures because the body has reached homeostasis at its abnormally high blood pressure. The blood pressure lowering effect becomes apparent when prazosin is taken for longer periods of time. The hea rate and contractility go back down over time and blood pressure decreases. The antihypeensive characteristics of prazosin make it a second-line choice for the treatment of high blood pressure. Prazosin is also useful in treating urinary hesitancy associated with prostatic hyperplasia, blocking alpha-1 receptors, which control constriction of both the prostate and urethra. Although not a first line choice for either hypeension or prostatic hyperplasia, it is a choice for patients who present with both problems concomitantly. There is some evidence that this medication is effective in treating nightmares, based on mixed results in randomized controlled trials. Prazosin was, however, shown to be more effective when treating nightmares related to PTSD.

NMDA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, which composed of multiple subunits, and each has distinct cellular and regional patterns of expression. Amantadine is a NMDA receptor Antagonist that is used in early Parkinson's disease to help tremor. In recent years, amantadine has also been found useful in reducing dyskinesia that occur with dopamine medication. Amantadine is well-tolerated, but its side effects include dry mouth, constipation, bladder problems, ankle swelling and skin rash.# COMT inhibitors such as Entacapone and Tolcapone represent the newest class of Parkinson's medications. These agents have no direct effect on PD symptoms but instead, are used to prolong the effect of levodopa by blocking its metabolism. COMT inhibitors are useful primarily to help with problem of wearing-off (effect of levodopa becomes short-lived).# Dopamine agonists: These are drugs that stimulate the parts of the human brain influenced by dopamine. In effect, the brain is tricked into thinking it is receiving the dopamine it needs. Dopamine agonists are not as potent as Carbidopa/Levodopa. These are less likely to cause dyskinesia and can be taken alone or in combination with medications containing levodopa.

        "exp": "Chemotherapy (often abbreted to chemo and sometimes CTX or CTx) is a type of cancer treatment that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapeutic agents) as pa of a standardized chemotherapy regimen. Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent (which almost always involves combinations of drugs), or it may aim to prolong life or to reduce symptoms (palliative chemotherapy). Chemotherapy is one of the major categories of the medical discipline specifically devoted to pharmacotherapy for cancer, which is called medical oncology Viually all chemotherapeutic regimens can cause depression of the immune system, often by paralysing the bone marrow and leading to a decrease of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Anemia and thrombocytopenia may require blood transfusion. Neutropenia (a decrease of the neutrophil granulocyte count below 0.5 x 109/litre) can be improved with synthetic G-CSF (granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, e.g., filgrastim, lenograstim).

        "exp": "Acute gout Oral colchicine given in doses of 0.5 mg twice or 3 times daily is the treatment of first choice in acute gout. It works by inhibiting microtubule assembly in neutrophils. The most common adverse effects are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Oral NSAIDs are also effective but are used less commonly since many patients affected by acute gout have coexisting cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or chronic kidney disease. Oral prednisolone (15-20 mg daily) or intramuscular methylprednisolone (80-120 mg daily) for 2-3 days are highly effective and are a good choice in elderly patients where there is an increased risk of toxicity with colchicine and NSAID . The IL-1b inhibitor canakinumab is effective but extremely expensive and so seldom given. Local ice packs can also be used for symptomatic relief. Prophylaxis for chronic gout Patients who have had a single attack of gout do not necessarily need to be given urate-lowering therapy, but individuals who have more than one acute attack within 12 months and those with complications such as tophi or erosions should be offered it . Allopurinol is the drug of first choice. It inhibits xanthine oxidase, which reduces the conversion of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. The recommended staing dose is 100 mg daily, or 50 mg in older patients and in renal impairment. The dose of allopurinol should be increased by 100 mg every 4 weeks (50 mg in the elderly and those with renal impairment) until the target uric acid level is achieved, side-effects occur or the maximum recommended dose is reached (900 mg/day). Febuxostat also inhibits xanthine oxidase. It is typically used in patients with an inadequate response to allopurinol, and when allopurinol is contraindicated or causes adverse effects. Febuxostat undergoes hepatic metabolism and no dose adjustment is required for renal impairment. It is more effective than allopurinol but commonly provokes acute attacks when therapy is initiated. The usual staing dose is 80 mg daily, increasing to 120 mg daily in patients with an inadequate response. Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid, sulfinpyrazone and benzbromarone, lower urate levels but are seldom used in routine clinical practice. They are contraindicated in over-producers and those with renal impairment or urolithiasis and require patients to maintain a high fluid intake to avoid uric acid crystallisation in the renal tubules. Pegloticase is a biological treatment in which the enzyme uricase (oxidises uric acid to 5-hydroxyisourate, which is then conveed to allantoin) has been conjugated to monomethoxypolyethylene glycol. It is indicated for the treatment of tophaceous gout resistant to standard therapy and is administered as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks for up to 6 months. It is highly effective at controlling hyperuricaemia and can cause regression of tophi. Lifestyle measures are equally impoant as drug therapy in the treatment of gout. Patients should be advised to lose weight where appropriate and to reduce excessive alcohol intake, especially beer. Ref - Davidsons 23e p1015-1016",

        "exp": "The function of brown adipose tissue is to transfer energy from food into heat; physiologically, both the heat produced and the resulting decrease in metabolic efficiency can be of significance. Both the acute activity of the tissue, i.e., the heat production, and the recruitment process in the tissue (that results in a higher thermogenic capacity) are under the control of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves. In thermoregulatory thermogenesis, brown adipose tissue is essential for classical nonshivering thermogenesis (this phenomenon does not exist in the absence of functional brown adipose tissue), as well as for the cold acclimation-recruited norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis. Heat production from brown adipose tissue is activated whenever the organism is in need of extra heat, e.g., postnatally, during entry into a febrile state, and during arousal from hibernation, and the rate of thermogenesis is centrally controlled a pathway initiated in the hypothalamus. Feeding as such also results in activation of brown adipose tissue; a series of diets, apparently all characterized by being low in protein, result in a leptin-dependent recruitment of the tissue; this metaboloregulatory thermogenesis is also under hypothalamic control. When the tissue is active, high amounts of lipids and glucose are combusted in the tissue. The development of brown adipose tissue with its characteristic protein, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), was probably determinative for the evolutionary success of mammals, as its thermogenesis enhances neonatal survival and allows for active life even in cold surroundings.

Total body copper is increased, with excess copper deposited in, and causing damage to, several organs. Normally, dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine and is rapidly taken into the liver, where it is stored and incorporated into caeruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. The accumulation of excessive copper in the body is ultimately prevented by its excretion, the most impoant route being bile. In Wilson's disease, there is almost always a failure of synthesis of caeruloplasmin; however, some 5% of patients have a normal circulating caeruloplasmin concentration and this is not the primary pathogenic defect. The amount of copper in the body at bih is normal but thereafter it increases steadily; the organs most affected are the liver, basal ganglia of the brain, eyes, kidneys and skeleton . Clinical features Neurological disease - Clinical features include a variety of extrapyramidal features, paicularly tremor, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism and dementia .Unusual clumsiness for age may be an early symptom. Liver disease - Episodes of acute hepatitis, sometimes recurrent, can occur, especially in children, and may progress to fulminant liver failure. The latter is characterised by the liberation of free copper into the blood stream, causing massive haemolysis and renal tubulopathy. Chronic hepatitis can also develop insidiously and eventually present with established cirrhosis; liver failure and poal hypeension may supervene.

These enzymes are involved in the detection of nucleotide mismatches and in the recognition of slipped-strand trinucleotide repeats. Germline mutations in these genes lead to microsatellite instability and a high mutation rate in colon cancer. This syndrome is characterized by autosomal dominant transmission of colon cancer, young age (50 years) of presentation, predisposition to lesions in the proximal large bowel, and associated malignancies such as uterine cancer and ovarian cancer. Fanconi's anemia is also associated with an increased risk of multiple acquired genetic abnormalities. It is characterized by diverse congenital anomalies and a strong predisposition to develop aplastic anemia and acute myelogenous leukemia. Cells from these patients are susceptible to chromosomal breaks caused by a defect in genetic recombination. A least eight different complementation groups have been identified, and several loci and genes associated with Fanconi's anemia have been mapped or cloned. Ataxia telangiectasia causes large telangiectatic lesions of the face, cerebellar ataxia, immunologic defects, and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. The discovery of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene reveals tha: it is homologous to genes involved in DNA repair and control of cell cycle checkpoints. Mutations in the ATM gene give rise to defects in meiosis as well as increasing susceptibility to damage from ionizing radiation. Trinucleotide expansion was first recognized as a cause of the fragile X syndrome, one of the most common causes of mental retardation.",

Specific cause of abdominal compament syndrome is not known, although some causes can be sepsis and severe abdominal trauma. Increasing pressure reduces blood flow to abdominal organs and impairs pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, and gastro-intestinal (GI) function, causing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death A pneumothorax is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall.Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shoness of breath.In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shoage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment this can be fatal.Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis. Positive-pressure ventilation means that airway pressure is applied at the patient's airway through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube.

In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death.Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms.This paial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria. The signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin 8-25 days following infection,] but may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention Initial manifestations of the disease--common to all malaria species--are similar to flu-like symptoms, and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases.The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions. The classic symptom of malaria is paroxysm--a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating, occurring every two days (teian fever) in P. vivax and P. ovale infections, and every three days (quaan fever) for P. malariae. P. falciparum infection can cause recurrent fever every 36-48 hours, or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever. Severe malaria is usually caused by P. falciparum (often referred to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9-30 days after infection.

Reduced surface expression of complement regulatory proteins CD55 and CD59 has been found in leucopenic patients with SLE. Deficiency of these proteins may make these cells susceptible to complement-mediated lysis. There is increasing evidence that endogenous production of type 1 interferons (IFNs) is implicated in the pathogenesis of neutropenia and lymphopenia in SLE. Elevated serum levels of IFN-a in SLE correlate inversely with leucocyte numbers# Neutropenia It is a common feature of SLE, with a prevalence rate of 47%, it may be mediated by anti-neutrophil antibodies.

Various factors can favour renal cast formation in myeloma patients. Dehydration, sometimes due to diuretics, reduces the glomerular filtaration rate (GFR) and causes an increase in the plasma concentration of light chains which then exceeds the capacity for reabsorption and catabolism of light chains in the proximal tubuli.> Hypercalcaemia may induce vasoconstriction followed by a decrease in GFR. Several drugs, in particular non- steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), reduce renal blood flow. Radiographic contrast agents may induce acute renal failure in myeloma patients, particularly if patients are dehydrated and ionic contrast media are used.> The osteoclasts respond to osteoclast activating factors (OAF) made by the myeloma cells . leading to hypercaicaemia. Renal failure occurs in nearly 25% of myeloma patients, and some renal pathology is noted in over half. Hypercalcemia is the most common cause of renal failure. Glomerular deposits of amyloid, hyperuricemia, recurrent infections, and occasional infiltration of the kidney by myeloma cells all may contribute to renal dysfunction. However, tubular damage associated with the excretion of light chains is almost always present. Normally, light chains are filtered, reabsorbed in the tubules, and catabolized. With the increase in the amount of light chains presented to the tubule, the tubular cells become overloaded with these proteins, and tubular damage results either directly from light chain toxic effects or indirectly from the release of intracellular lysosomal enzymes. The earliest manifestation of this tubular damage is the adult Fanconi syndrome (a type 2 proximal renal tubular acidosis), with loss of glucose and amino acids, as well as defects in the ability of the kidney to acidify and concentrate the urine. The proteinuria is not accompanied by hypertension, and the protein is nearly all light chains. Generally, very little albumin is in the urine because glomerular function is usually normal.",

        "exp": "The French paradox is a catchphrase first used in the late 1980s, that summarizes the apparently paradoxical epidemiological observation that French people have a relatively low incidence of coronary hea disease (CHD), while having a diet relatively rich in saturated fats,in apparent contradiction to the widely held belief that the high consumption of such fats is a risk factor for CHD. The paradox is that if the thesis linking saturated fats to CHD is valid, the French ought to have a higher rate of CHD than comparable countries where the per capita consumption of such fats is lower. The French paradox implies two impoant possibilities. The first is that the hypothesis linking saturated fats to CHD is not completely valid (or, at the extreme, is entirely invalid). The second possibility is that the link between saturated fats and CHD is valid, but that some additional factor in the French diet or lifestyle mitigates this risk--presumably with the implication that if this factor can be identified, it can be incorporated into the diet and lifestyle of other countries, with the same lifesaving implications observed in France. Both possibilities have generated considerable media interest, as well as some scientific research. It has also been suggested that the French paradox is an illusion, created in pa by differences in the way that French authorities collect health statistics, as compared to other countries, and in pa by the long-term effects, in the coronary health of French citizens, of changes in dietary patterns which were adopted years earlier. In 1991, Renaud extended his studies in panership with then junior researchers, cardiologist Michel de Lorgeril and dietician Patricia Salen. The three enhanced Renaud's study, with their paper concluding that: a diet based on southwestern Mediterranean cuisine; which is high in omega-3 oils, antioxidants and includes \"moderate consumption\" of red wine; created lower cases of cancer, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease; paly through increasing HDL cholesterol whilst reducing LDL cholesterol Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 529",

The version related to histamine is due to an allergic reaction to agents such as insect bites, foods, or medications. The version related to bradykinin may occur due to an inherited problem known as C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, medications known as angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitors, or a lymphoproliferative disorder. Effos to protect the airway may include intubation or cricothyroidotomy. Histamine-related angioedema can be treated with antihistamines, coicosteroids, and epinephrine.In those with bradykinin-related disease a C1 esterase inhibitor, ecallantide, or icatibant may be used.Fresh frozen plasma may be used insteadIn the United States the disease affects about 100,000 people a year. The skin of the face, normally around the mouth, and the mucosa of the mouth and/or throat, as well as the tongue, swell over the period of minutes to hours. The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands. The swelling can be itchy or painful. There may also be slightly decreased sensation in the affected areas due to compression of the nerves. Uicaria (hives) may develop simultaneously. In severe cases, stridor of the airway occurs, with gasping or wheezy inspiratory breath sounds and decreasing oxygen levels. Tracheal intubation is required in these situations to prevent respiratory arrest and risk of death. Sometimes, the cause is recent exposure to an allergen (e.g. peanuts), but more often it is either idiopathic (unknown) or only weakly correlated to allergen exposure Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 461",

Children with this disease often die within 5 years because of dissecting aneurysms or cardiac rupture.> MFS is characterized by a triad of features: (1) long, thin extremities frequently associated with other skeletalchanges, such as loose joints and arachnodactyly;(2) reduced vision as the result of dislocations of the lenses (ectopia lentis);and (3) aortic aneurysms that typically begin at the base of the aorta. The disorder is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait; at least one-fourth of patients do not have an affected parent, and therefore probably represent new mutations.> The changes in Ehler Danlos syndrome vary from thin and velvety skin to skin that is either dramatically hyperextensible (\"rubber man\" syndrome) or easily torn or scarred. Type I patients develop characteristic \"cigarette-paper\"scars. In type IV extensive scars and hyperpigmentation develop over bony prominences, and the skin may be so thin that subcutaneous blood vessels are visible. In type VIII the skin is more fragile than hyperextensible, and it heals with atrophic, pigmented scars. Easy bruisability occurs in several types of EDS.> The diagnosis of classic AS is based on X-linked inheritance of hematuria, sensorineural deafness, and lenticonus. Because of the X-linked transmission, women are generally underdiagnosed and are usually less severely affected than men. The hematuria progresses to nephritis and may cause renal failure in late adolescence in affected males and at older ages in some women. The sensorineural deafnes is primarily in the high-tone range. It can frequently be detected only by an audiogram and is usually not progressive. The lenticonus can occur without nephritis but is generally considered to be pathognomonic of classic ASR. Renal transplantation is usually successful.",
