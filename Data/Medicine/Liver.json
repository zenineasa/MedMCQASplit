Biosynthesis of factors 11. VII, IX, and X depends on vitamin K.Marked prolongation of the prothrombin time, >5 s above control and not corrected by parenteral vitamin K administration, is a poor prognostic sign in acute viral hepatitis and other acute and chronic liver diseases.Serum albumin is synthesized exclusively by hepatocytes.Serum albumin has a long half-life: 18-20 days, with 4% degraded per day.Because of this slow turnover, the serum albumin is not a good indicator of acute or mild hepatic dysfunction; only minimal changes in the serum albumin are seen in acute liver conditions such as viral hepatitis, drug-related hepatoxicity, and obstructive jaundice.In hepatitis, albumin levels <3 g/dL should raise the possibility of chronic liver disease.Hypoalbuminemia is more common in chronic liver disorders such as cirrhosis and usually reflects severe liver damage and decreased albumin synthesis.Serum globulins are a group of proteins made up of gammaglobulins (immunoglobulins) produced by B lymphocytes and alpha and beta globulins produced primarily in hepatocytes.Gamma globulins are increased in chronic liver disease, such as chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis.In cirrhosis, the increased serum gamma globulin concentration is due to the increased synthesis of antibodies, some of which are directed against intestinal bacteria.This occurs because the cirrhotic liver fails to clear bacterial antigens that normally reach the liver through the hepatic circulation.",

Conjugated bilirubin is not taken up by the intestinal mucosa. When the conjugated bilirubin reaches the distal ileum and colon, it is hydrolyzed to unconjugated bilirubin by bacterial b-glucuronidases. The unconjugated bilirubin is reduced by normal gut bacteria to form a group of colorless tetrapyrroles called urobilinogens. About 80- 90% of these products are excreted in feces, either unchanged or oxidized to orange derivatives called urobilins. The remaining 10-20% of the urobilinogens are passively absorbed, enter the portal venous blood, and are re-excreted by the liver.
