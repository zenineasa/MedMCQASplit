An intradermal injection of specially prepared tissue derived from the spleen of a known sarcoidosis patient is biopsied 4-6 weeks after injection. If noncaseating granulomas are seen, this is highly specific for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Unfortunately, there is no commercially available Kviem-Siltzbach reagent, and some locally prepared batches have lower specificity. Thus, this test is of historic interest and is rarely used in current clinical practice.IMPORTANT INTRADERMAL TESTSTESTDISEASETuberculin test, also known as Pirquet's test/reaction or scarification testTuberculosisLeprominLeprosyFrei's testLymphogranuloma venerumIto Reenstiema test or ducrei s testHemophillus ducrei or chancroidAnthraxin skin testAnthraxFoshay testBartonella hanseieDick's testScarlet feverTrichophytinAllergic hypersensitivity to dermatophytesCandidinCandida albicansCoccoidin or spherulin testCoccidioides immitansHistoplasminHistoplasmosisMontenegro or lieshmanin testLeishmaniasisOncocercaOncocercariasisDraize test and Freund's complete adjuvant testtesting sensitization potentialPredictive sensitization testsUsed to compare the sensitizing properties of new products or chemicals with those of known substancesAutologus serum skin testing (ASST)Idiopathic urticariaKviem sitzbach testSarcoidosisPathergy testBehcet's diseaseHistamine testAxon reflex, tuberculoid leprosyPilocarpine testIntegrity of dermal nerves , axon reflex",
