IgA is the antibody class most often seen in the immune complexes and has been demonstrated in the renal biopsies of these patients.Clinical and Laboratory Manifestations# Palpable purpura (most commonly distributed over the buttocks and lower extremities and in pediatric patients, palpable purpura is seen in virtually all patients),# Arthralgias (most patients develop poly- arthralgias in the absence of frank arthritis),# GI signs and symptoms and# Glomerulonephritis (occurs in 10-50% of patients).# Myocardial involvement can occur in adults but is rare in children.# Lab studies show a mild leukocytosis, a normal platelet count, and occasionally eosinophilia. Serum complement components are normal, and IgA levels are elevated.Diagnosis# The diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura is based on clinical signs and symptoms.# Skin biopsy useful in confirming leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA and C3 deposition.# Renal biopsy is rarely needed for diagnosis but may provide prognostic information in some.Prognosis# The prognosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura is excellent.# Mortality is exceedingly rare, and 1-5% of children progress to end-stage renal disease.# Most patients recover completely, and some do not require therapy.Rx:# Rx is similar for adults and children. When glucocorticoid therapy is required, prednisone, in doses of 1 mg/kg per day and tapered according to clinical response; however, it has not proven beneficial in the Rx of skin or renal disease and does not appear to shorten the duration of active disease or lessen the chance of recurrence.# Patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis have been anecdotally reported to benefit from intensive plasma exchange combined with cytotoxic drugs.",

The basic principle is that the normal plasma contributes a sufficient amount of clotting factor to correct for a factor deficiency.A mixing study that corrects the APTT is characteristic of a coagulation factor where as one that does not correct indicates a factor inhibitor.Correction neutralization (with phospholipids)An excess of phospholipid is added to the patient sample and APII, DRVVT is performed.The basic principle behind this is that lupus anticoagulant is directed against phospholipid.

In chronic DIC. the bleeding symptoms are discrete and restricted to the skin or mucosal surfaces.

Hemodynamic complications and shock are common among patients with acute DIC. The mortality ranges from 30 to >80% depending on the underlying disease, the severity of the DIC. and the age of the patient. Lab Findings Prolongation of PT and/or aPTT. Platelet counts 1,00,000/L3 or a rapid decline in platelet numbers. Presence of schistocytes (fragmented red cells) in the blood smear: and Elevated levels of FDP. The most sensitive test for DIC is the FDP level. DIC is an unlikely diagnosis in the presence of normal levels of FDP. The D-dimer test is more specific for detection of fibrin--but not fibrinogen--degradation products and indicates that the crosslinked fibrin has been digested by plasmin. Because fibrinogen has a prolonged half-life, plasma levels diminish acutely only in severe cases of DIC. High-grade DIC is also associated with levels of antithrombin III or plasminogen activity <60% of normal.

Lack of ADA causes accumulation of dATP. This metabolite will inhibit the activity of ribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme that reduces ribonucleotides to generate deoxyribonucleotides.The effectiveness of the immune system depends upon lymphocyte proliferation and hence dNTP synthesis.

Traditionally, this has been prednisone at 1 mg/kg, although Rh (D) immune globulin therapy (WinRho SDF), at 50-75 g/kg, is also being used in this setting.IVIgG has more efficacy than anti-Rh0(D) in postsplenectomized patients.

CLL involves primarily bone marrow and blood, while SLL involves lymph nodes. Morphology of CLL/SLL o The tumor cells of CLL are small B lymphocytes. Leukemic cells have the morphological appearance of normal small to medium sized lymphocytes with clumped chromatin, inconspicuous nuclei and a small ring of cytoplasm. o The lymph node architecture is diffusely effaced by these tumor cells. These cells are mixed with variable numbers of larger cells called prolymphocytes. In many cases, prolymphyocytes gather together focally to form as proliferation centers, so called because they contain relatively large number of mitotic activity. When present proliferation centers are pathognomonic for CLL/SLL. o In CLL, the peripheral blood contains increased numbers of small, round lymphocytes with scant frequently disrupted in the process of making smears, producing So called smudge cells (Basket 'cells' or parachute 'cells'). Markers of CLL tumor cells o CLL is a tumor of mature B-cells, therefore it expresses the B-cell markers such as CDI9, CD20 and surface IgM and IgD. In addition CD 23 and CD5 are also present (In contrast to mantle cell lymphoma which is positive for CD5 but negative for CD23). Clinical features of CLL o Most patients present at ages over 50 with a male predominance. Patients with CLL are often asymptomatic. When symptoms appear, they are nonspecific and include easy fatigability, weight loss and anorexia. Other symptoms are # Hepatosplenomegaly # Hypogammaglobulinemia - Increased susceptibiltiy to infections. # Lymphodenopathy # Autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia o CLL has a tendency to transform into more aggressive lymphoid neoplams:- i) Prolymphocytic leukemia - Characterized by worsening of cytopenia, marked splenomagaly and appearance of prolymphocytes in the peripheral blood. ii)Richiter syndrome - CLL is transformed into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",

Patients with sickle cell disease often suffer from autosplenectomy as a result of splenic destruction by the numerous infarcts associated with sickle cell crises during childhood. Indeed, the presence of a palpable spleen in a patient with sickle cell disease after age 5 suggests a coexisting hemoglobinopathy, e.g., thalassemia or hemoglobin C. In addition, patients who receive splenic irradiation for a neoplastic or autoimmune disease are also functionally hyposplenic. The term hyposplenism is preferred to asplenism in referring to the physiologic consequences of splenectomy because asplenia is a rare, specific, and fatal congenital abnormality in which there is a failure of the left side of the coelomic cavity (which includes the splenic anlagen) to develop normally. Infants with asplenia have no spleens, but that is the least of their problems. The right side of the developing embryo is duplicated on the left so there is liver where the spleen should be, there are two right lungs, and the heart comprises two right atria and two right ventricles.",

Despite dramatic prolongation of the PTT often to greater than 100 s, deficient individuals have normal hemostasis and can undergo major surgery without plasma replacement therapy. Direct activation of factor IX by the tissue factor-Vlla complex may bypass this defective step in coagulation.0DEFICIENCIES IN FACTORS V, VII, X, AND PROTHROMBIN (FACTOR H)Deficiencies in factors V, VII, X, and prothrombin (factor II) are exceedingly rare autosomal recessive disorders. Spontaneous or posttraumatic musculoskeletal bleeding or menorrhagia* can occur with these deficiencies, but hemarthroses are uncommon. FFP is the appropriate therapy.Factor XI DeficiencyInherited as an autosomal recessive trait and is especially common in Ashkenazi Jews. In contrast to deficiency in factors VIII and IX, the correlation between factor level and propensity to bleed is not as precise, spontaneous bleeding is less, and hemarthroses are rare. Many patients with factor XI deficiency present with posttraumatic bleeding or with bleeding in the perioperative period, and occasional factor Xl-deficient women have menorrhagia. Daily infusions of FFP are sufficient, since the half-life of factor XI is approx 24 h.FACTOR XIH DEFICIENCY (extremely rare)Factor XIII is a transglutaminase that stabilizes fibrin clots by forming e-amino-y-glutamyl cross-links between adjacent a and alpha chains of fibrin. Patients usually bleed in the neonatal period from their umbilical stump or circumcision.In addition to hemorrhage, these patients may have poor wound healing, a high incidence of infertility among males and abortion among affected females, and a high incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. Several drugs, including isoniazid, may bind to cross-linking sites on fibrinogen and mimic factor XIII deficiency by blocking enzyme activity. Normal hemostasis requires only 1% of normal enzyme activity; a single infusion of FFP or a purified factor XHI-rich product derived from human placenta called Fibrogammin is effective.

Rituximab eliminates normal B cells, including those producing the anti-platelet antibody. This B cell depletion is transient (lasting 12 to 18 months, normally) and has surprisingly few S/E.",
