D. 2:1 blockElectrocardiography and Electrophysiology of AV conduction blockAV conduction block typically is diagnosed electrocardiographically, which characterizes the severity of the conduction disturbances and allows one to draw inferences about the location of the block. AV conduction block manifests as slow conduction in its mildest forms and failure to conduct, either intermittent of persistently, in more severe varieties.a. First degree AV block (PR interval >200ms) is a slowing of conduction through the AV junction. The site of delay is typically in the AV node but may be in the atria, bundle of his, or his Purkinje system. A wide QRS is suggestive of delay in the AV node proper or less commonly in the bundle of His. In second degree AV block there is an intermittent failure of electrical impulse conduction from atrium to ventricle.b. Second degree AV block is sub classified as Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) or Mobitz type II. The periodic failure of conduction in Mobitz, type I block is characterized by a progressively lengthening PR interval, shortening of the RR interval, and a pause that is less than the two times the immediately preceding RR interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG complex after the pause exhibits a shorter PR interval than that immediately preceding the pause. This ECG pattern most often arises because of decremental conduction of electrical impulses in the AV node.",

Subacute pericarditis (6 weeks to 6 months)a) Effusinve-constrictiveb) ConstrictiveIII) Chronic pericarditis (> 6 months)a) Constrictiveb) Effusivec) Adhesive (nonconstrictive)* Serous pericarditis is characteristically produced by non- infectious inflammatory diseases, including rheumatic fever, SLE, and scleroderma, as well as tumors and uremia. An infection in the tissues contiguous to the pericardium-- for example, a bacterial pleuritis--may incite sufficient irritation of the parietal pericardial serosa to cause a sterile serous effusion that can progress to serofibrinous pericarditis and ultimately to a frank suppurative reaction.* Fibrinous and serofibrinous pericarditis are the most frequent types ofpericarditis; these are composed of serous fluid variably admixed with a fibrinous exudate. Common causes include acute MI, postinfarction (Dressier) syndrome (an autoimmune response appearing days-weeks after an MI), uremia, chest radiation, rheumatic fever, SLE, and trauma. A fibrinous reaction also follows routine cardiac surgery.* Purulent or suppurative pericarditis reflects an active infection caused by microbial invasion of the pericardial space.* Hemorrhagic pericarditis has an exudate composed of blood mixed with a fibrinous or suppurative effusion; it is most commonly caused by the spread of a malignant neoplasm to the pericardial space.* Caseous pericarditis is, until proved otherwise, tuber- culous in origin; infrequently, fungal infections evoke a similar reaction.",

The most frequent type of vasodepressor syncope is vaso vagal hypotension or the common faint, which is often initiated by a stressful, painful or claustrophic experience, especially in young women\" - CMDT 06/384SYNCOPESyncope is a transient, self-limited loss of consciousness due to acute global impairment of cerebral blood flow. The onset is rapid, duration brief, and recovery spontaneous and complete.A syncopal prodrome (presyncope) is common, although loss of consciousness may occur without any warning symptoms. Typical presyncopal symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness, weakness, fatigue, and visual and auditory disturbances.The causes of syncope can be divided into three general categories: (1) neurally mediated syncope (also called reflex syncope), (2) orthostatic hypotension, and (3) cardiac svncope.Neurally mediated syncope comprises a heterogeneous group of functional disorders that are characterized by a transient change in the reflexes responsible for maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis. Episodic vasodi/at/on and bradycardia occur in varying combinations; resulting in temporary failure of blood pressure control.The upright posture imposes a unique physiologic stress upon humans; most, although not all, syncopal episodes occur from a standing position. Standing results in pooling of 500-1000 mL of blood in the lower extremities and splanchnic circulation.

Thus if an impulse lands on the bundle of HIS and finds the right bundle refractory then RBBB will occur. Also remember that the refractory period of right fascicle ix more than that of the left fascicle resulting in RBBB mostly in these patients.ECG findings of LBBBNormally the septum is activated from left to right, producing small Q waves in the lateral leads. In LBBB, the normal direction of septal depolarisation is reversed (becomes right to left), as the impulse spreads first to the RV via the right bundle branch and them to the LVvia the septum.This sequence of activation extends the qRS duration to> 120 ms and eliminates the normal septal Q waves in the lateral leads.The overall direction of depolarisation (from right to left) produces tall R waves in the lateral leads (laVLV5V6) deep S waves in the right precordial leads (V4 R) and usually leads to left axis deviation.As the ventricles are activated sequentially (right, then left) rather than simultaneously, this produces a broad or notched ('M'-shaped) R wave in the lateral leads.Non-concordance in ST segment and T wave changes.The point is that the two fasciles of bundle of his have different refractory periods with the right fascicle having higher refractory period than the left.This means that if an impulse lands on the bundle of HIS and finds the right bundle refractory then RBBB will occur.In atrial fibrillation because of faster conduction, normally we see narrow complex qRS but sometimes we may- see broad complex qRS also which is technically called Ashmann phenomenon.Mostly in Ashmann phenomenon RBBB is seen based on the physiological principle of refractory period of right fascicle more than the left one. However, rarely LBBB can also be seen if the impulse lands to find the left fascicle refractory. Irrespective of RBBB or LBBB, broad complex qRS will occur in case of atrial fibrillation and Ashmann phenomenon is occurrence of broad complex qRS in atrial fibrillation and not the occurrence of RBBB as is the popular perception.Hyperkalemia can cause defective repolarization and hence cause Bundle branch block that culminates in sine wave pattern.In acute MI, ischemia can damage the left bundle leading to LBBB.",

        "exp": "Ans. c (Characterized by two palpable weak waves, one in systole and other in diastole) (Ref. Harrison, Principles of Medicine - 18th/Chapter 227)The bisferiens pulse, which has two systolic peaks, is characteristic of aortic regurgitation (with or without accompanying stenosis) and of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the latter condition, the pulse wave upstroke rises rapidly and forcefully, producing the first systolic peak (\"percussion wave\"). A brief decline in pressure follows because of the sudden midsystolic decrease in the rate of left ventricular ejection, when severe obstruction often develops. This pressure trough is followed by a smaller and more slowly rising positive pulse wave (\"tidal wave\") produced by continued ventricular ejection and by reflected waves from the periphery. The dicrotic pulse has two palpable waves, one in systole and one in diastole. It usually denotes a very low stroke volume, particularly in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.# Pulsus alternans (pulses normalis aggregans) is a pattern in which there is regular alteration of the pressure pulse amplitude, despite a regular rhythm. It is due to alternating left ventricular contractile force, usually indicates severe impairment of left ventricular function, and commonly occurs in patients who also have a loud third heart sound. Pulsus alternans may also occur during or following paroxysmal tachycardia or for several beats following a premature beat in patients without heart disease.# In pulsus bigeminus, there is also a regular alteration of pressure pulse amplitude, but it is caused by a premature ventricular contraction that follows each regular beat.# In pulsus paradoxus, the decrease in systolic arterial pressure that normally accompanies the reduction in arterial pulse amplitude during inspiration is accentuated. In patients with pericardial tamponade, airway obstruction, or superior vena cava obstruction, the decrease in systolic arterial pressure frequently exceeds the normal decrease of 10 mm Hg and the peripheral pulse may disappear completely during inspiration.ARTERIAL PULSESVARIOUS ARTERIAL PULSESMECHANISMETIOLOGYPulsus paradoxusDecrease in SBP (< 10 mm Hg) that normally accompanies decrease in arterial pulse amplitude during inspiration is accentuated.It refers to a fall in systolic pressure >10 mmHg with inspiration.# Pericardial effusion# Pericardial temponade# Pulmonary embolism (massive)# SVC obstruction# Hemorrhagic shock# Severe obstructive lung disease# Tension pneumothorax.Pulsus bigeminusRegular alteration of pressure pulse amplitude, but it is caused by a premature ventricular contraction that follows each regular beat.PVCsPulsus alternansRegular alteration of pressure pulse amplitude, despite regular rhythm, (defined by beat-to-beat variability of pulse amplitude.

Physical examination shows BP of 148/94, HR 96, and RR 16. O2 saturation is 92%. Neck veins show the jugular column 7 cm above the sternal angle. Lung examination reveals mild basilar crackles but no wheezing. Cardiac examination shows sustained apex impulse, S4 gallop, and no murmur. There is no peripheral edema.

The cardiac silhouette is boot-shaped, but there is no definite cardiomegaly. Echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy and LV ejection fraction of 55% (normal 50%-70%). What is the likely pathogenesis of this patient's dyspnea?",
        "exp": "The most likely explanation for this patient's presentation is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), also known as diastolic dysfunction. As many as 50% of patients presenting with definite HF (Heart failure) will have an ejection fraction above 50%. HFPEF is more common in the elderly, in women, and those with conditions (especially hypertension) that lead to LV hypertrophy. Often the echocardiogram will show evidence of impaired relaxation or increased stiffness of the LV (the latter often suggested by decreased flow across the MV during atrial systole, giving the so-called reversed e/a flow ratio). Tachycardia, by decreasing diastolic filling time, will often worsen HF symptoms in diastolic dysfunction. As opposed to systolic HF, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have not demonstrated long-term survival benefit. Management focuses on controlling BP, preventing tachycardia, and treating pulmonary and peripheral fluid overload with diuretics; so many of the modalities used in systolic HF are also employed in HFPEF, just without proof of survival benefit.High output HF due to an AV fistula, Paget disease, or hyperthyroidism can mimic diastolic HF, but the patient usually has evidence of a hyperdynamic circulation (tachycardia, wide pulse pressure, hyperdynamic precordium). Occult CAD should be considered in patients with exertional dyspnea (which can be an angina equivalent), but this patient's rest symptoms and pulmonary vascular congestion would be unusual. In HF due to coronary artery disease, there is almost always evidence of prior MI or ischemic change on ECG. Nevertheless, a stress test is often obtained in patients with unexplained HF to rule out this possibility. Interstitial lung disease can cause rales and interstitial changes on CXR but would not explain the cephalization of flow nor the elevated venous pressure. Measuring B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) will resolve the issue in equivocal cases; BNP will be elevated in HF and normal or minimally elevated in ILD. Anemia can cause fatigue and exertional dyspnea and, rarely, even overt HF, but to cause HF the anemia would have to be very severe (usually Hb 7 g/dL or below) and should be apparent from the physical examination. In addition, severe anemia would usually cause evidence of hyperdynamic circulation as seen in high-output HF.",

Harrison, Principles of Medicine, 18th/Chapter 227.)Pulsus paradoxus is measured by noting the difference between the systolic pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds are first heard (during expiration) and the systolic pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds are heard with each heartbeat, independent of the respiratory phase. Between these two pressures, the Korotkoff sounds are heard only intermittently and during expiration. The cuff pressure must be decreased slowly to appreciate the finding. It can be difficult to measure pulsus paradoxus in patients with tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or tachypnea. A pulsus paradoxus may be palpable at the brachial artery or femoral artery level when the pressure difference exceeds 15 mmHg. This inspiratory fall in systolic pressure is an exaggerated consequence of interventricular dependence.ARTERIAL PULSESMECHANISMEncountered inPulsus paradoxusDecrease in SBP (< 10 mm Hg) that normally accompanies decrease in arterial pulse amplitude during inspiration is accentuated.It refers to a fall in systolic pressure >10 mmHg with inspiration.- Pericardial effusion- Pericardial tamponade0- Pulmonary embolism (massive)- SVC obstruction- Hemorrhagic shock- Severe obstructive lung disease- Tension pneumothorax.",

ACE inhibitors stabilize left, ventricular remodeling, improve symptoms, reduce hospitalization, and decrease mortality. Beta- blocker therapy represents a major advance in the treatment of patients with HF and depressed systolic function. These drugs interfere with the harmful effects of sustained activation of the adrenergic nervous system by competitively blocking beta-receptors. When given with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers stabilize left ventricular remodeling, improve patient symptoms, reduce hospitalization, and decrease mortality. An aldosterone antagonist is recommended for patients with NYHA class III or IV symptoms who have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35% and who are still symptomatic despite receiving standard therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Likewise, digoxin may improve symptoms and decrease hospitalization rates in patients with HF but has not been shown to prolong life. Neither of these drugs is indicated in this patient with mild symptoms. Furosemide is used to improve symptoms but does not prolong survival. Since this patient wants to minimize medications, an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker are better first choices because they confer a survival advantage.

Harrison 17th/p. 1477)Harrison 12th/p. 1477The extent and velocity of wall motion are normal or even supernormal, until myocardial contractility declines. A rapid, high-frequency fluttering of the anterior mitral leaflet produced by the impact of the regurgitant jet is a characteristic finding. The echocardiogram is also useful in determining the cause of AR, by detecting dilatation of the aortic annulus and root or aortic dissection.AORTIC REGURGITATIONEtiology# In approximately two-thirds of patients with valvular AR, the disease is rheumatic in origin.# AR represents the most frequent serious lesion in patients surviving nonpenetrating cardiac injuries.Pathophysiology# In patients with wide-open (free) AR, the volume of regurgitant flow may equal the effective forward stroke volume.# In contrast to MR, in which a fraction of the LV stroke volume is delivered into the low-pressure LA, in AR the entire LV stroke volume is ejected into a high-pressure zone, the aorta.# Considerable thickening of the LV wall also occurs with chronic AR and Myocardial ischemia may occur.C/f# M>F# In patients with acute severe AR, as may occur in infective endocarditis, aortic dissection, or trauma, pulmonary edema and/or cardiogenic shock may develop rapidly.# Chronic severe AR may develop.Physical Findings# UNCOMMON SIGNS OF AORTIC REGURGITATION INCLUDE;- Large-volume, 'collapsing' pulse also known as:1. Watson's water hammer pulse Q2. Corrigan's pulse (rapid upstroke and collapse of the carotid artery pulse). Corrigan's pulse: A rapidly rising \"water-hammer\" pulse, which collapses suddenly as arterial pressure falls rapidly during late systole and diastole.3. Quincke's pulse: Capillary pulsations, an alternate flushing and paling of the skin at the root of the nail while pressure is applied to the tip of the nail.4. Traube's sign: A booming \"pistol-shot\" sound heard over the femoral arteries.5. Duroziez's sign: a to-and-fro murmur audible if the femoral artery is lightly compressed with a stethoscope.6. de Musset's sign: jarring of the entire body and the bobbing motion of the head with each systole.7. Hill's sign: a > 20 mm Hg diff in popliteal and brachial systolic cuff pressures, seen in chronic severe AI.8. Lighthouse sign (blanching & flushing of forehead)9. Landolfi's sign (alternating constriction & dilatation of pupil)10. Becker's sign (pulsations of retinal vessels)11. Muller's sign (pulsations of uvula)12. Mayen's sign (diastolic drop of BP>15 mm Hg with arm raised)13. Rosenbach's sign (pulsatile liver)14. Gerhardt's sign (enlarged spleen)15. Lincoln sign (pulsatile popliteal)16. Sherman sign (dorsalis pedis pulse is quickly located & unexpectedly prominent in age>75 yr)17. Ashrafian sign (Pulsatile pseudo-proptosis).In many patients with pure AR or with combined AS and AR, the carotid arterial pulse is bisferiens, i.e., with two systolic waves separated by a troughsAuscultation# In patients with severe AR, the aortic valve closure sound (A2) is usually absent.# An S3 and systolic ejection sound are frequently audible, and occasionally an S4 also may be heard.# The murmur of chronic AR is typically a high-pitched, blowing, decrescendo diastolic murmur, heard best in the third intercostal space along the left sternal border.# \"Cooing\" or musical diastolic murmurs suggest eversion of an aortic cusp vibrating in the regurgitant stream.# A mid-systolic ejection murmur is frequently audible in isolated AR. It is generally heard best at the base of the heart and is transmitted along the carotid vessels.# A third murmur frequently heard in patients with severe AR is the Austin Flint murmur, a soft, low-pitched, rumbling mid-diastolic murmur. It is probably produced by the diastolic displacement of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve by the AR stream but does not appear to be associated with hemodynamically significant mitral obstruction.# The auscultatory features of AR are intensified by strenuous handgrip, which augments systemic resistance.ECG# In patients with chronic severe AR, the ECG signs of LV hypertrophy become manifest.# In addition, these patients frequently exhibit ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 (\"LV strain\").# Left axis deviation and/or QRS prolongation denote diffuse myocardial disease, generally associated with patchy fibrosis, and usually signify a poor prognosis.Echocardiogram# The extent and velocity of wall motion are normal or even supernormal, until myocardial contractility declines.# A rapid, high-frequency fluttering of the anterior mitral leaflet produced by the impact of the regurgitant jet is a characteristic finding.0# Color flow Doppler echocardiographic imaging is very sensitive in the detection of AR, and Doppler echocardiography is helpful in assessing its severity.# With severe AR, the central jet width exceeds 65% of the left ventricular outflow tract, the regurgitant volume is 60 ml/ beat, the regurgitant fraction is 50%, and there is diastolic flow reversal in the proximal descending thoracic aorta.Chest X-RayIn chronic severe AR, the apex is displaced downward and to the left in the frontal projection. In the left anterior oblique and lateral projections, the LV is displaced posteriorly and encroaches on the spine.Aortic Regurgitation: TreatmentAcute Aortic RegurgitationPatients with acute severe AR may respond to intravenous diuretics and vasodilators (such as sodium nitroprusside), but stabilization is usually short-lived and operation is indicated urgently. Intra aortic balloon counterpulsation is contraindicated. Beta-blockers are also best avoided. Surgery is the treatment of choice.Chronic Aortic RegurgitationEarly symptoms of dyspnea and effort intolerance respond to treatment with diuretics, and vasodilators (ACE inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or hydralazine) may be useful as well. Surgery can then be performed in more controlled circumstances. Expert consensus is strong regarding the need to control systolic blood pressure (goal <140 mmHg) in patients with chronic AR, and vasodilators are an excellent first choice as antihypertensive agents. Beta blockers may be useful to retard the rate of aortic root enlargement in young patients with Marfan syndrome and aortic root dilatation with no or only mild AR. Patients with severe AR should avoid isometric exercises.",

EC followed by percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (Ref: Harrison 19/e p1539, 18/e p1932)\"Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy has subsequently become a mainstay of the management of rheumatic mitral stenosis. In the past, closed or open commisurotomy (after the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass) was the mainstay of therapy for rheumatic mitral stenosis. Currently, this procedure is most often performed using trans-septal access to the left atrium and a balloon catheter developed by a Japanese surgeon, Kanji Inoue. The dumbbell-shaped Inoue balloon catheter allows stable and sequential dilation of the stenotic mitral valve. A favourable response to mitral dilation is predicated on the presence of fused mitral commissures, as seen in rheumatic disease. Dilation is relatively ineffective in the absence of commissural fusion.\"Management Strategy for Patients with Mitral Stenosis (MS) and Mild Symptoms. There is controversy as to whether patients with severe MS (MVA <1 cm2) and severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) (PASP >60 mmHg) should undergo percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) or mitral valve replacement (MVR) to prevent right ventricular failure.

Therefore, operative repair is typically recommended in asymptomatic individuals when the AAA diameter is greater than 5.5 cm; other indications for surgery are rapid expansion or onset of symptoms. With careful preoperative evaluation and postoperative care, the surgical mortality rate should be less than 1% to 2%.

Aortic stenosis (Ref: Harrison 19/e p1529. 18/e p 1939)Patients of aortic stenosis have dyspnea, syncope and angina.'Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exertional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Often, there is a history of insidious progression of fatigue and dyspnea associated with gradual curtailment of activities. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability.: Exertional syncope may result from a decline in arterial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in non-exercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

Vasopressorso Vasopressors are recommended for patients with cardiogenic shock.o Although there is no definitive evidence of the superiority ofone vasopressor over another, begin with norepinephrine.IABP (Intra Aortic Balloon pump)o The recommendations for the use of an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) in patients with acute MI and cardiogenic shock are as follows.o For patients in whom mechanical complications (eg, acute mitral regurgitation or rupture of the ventricular septum) are not present and for whom revascularization is planned, intaaortic balloon pumping is not suggested.o However, for such patients whose hemodynamic parameters and clinical status are rapidly deteriorating while on vasopressor and inotropic support, placement of an IABP is suggested# Deterioration is considered present when the systolic blood pressure is persistently below 80 mmHg, there is a fall urine output or a worsening of mentation, the arterial oxygen saturation is falling, or cardiac arrhythmias (including heart block or ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation) develop or worsen.o The role of IABP is not well studied in the uncommon patient treated with fibrinolytic therapy whose hemodynamic parameters and clinical status are rapidly deteriorating while on vasopressor and inotropic support and for whom transfer to a facility capable of performing urgent revascularization is planned.Reperfusiono All patients with CS complication Ml should undergo an attempt at reoer fusion.o The recommendations for the use of reperfusion therapy in patients with MI complicated by CS are similar to those for most patients with Ml and differ principally in the level of evidence For patients with ST elevation MI, revascularization is recommended as opposed to fibrinolytic therapy.This recommendation requires that diagnostic coronary' angiography be performed within 90 minutes of initial hospital presentation.For those patients who cannot undergo timely coronary angiography fibrinolytic therapy rather than no immediate reperfusion.For patients with mechanical complications, immediate CABG is recommended and attempt at repair of the mechanical defect as opposed to PCI.Treatment options for cardiogenic shock due to left ventricular dysfunctiono General measuresVentilation support to correct hypoxemia and, in part, acidosisOptimize intravascular volumeSodium bicarbonate only for severe metabolic acidosis (arterial pH less than 7.10 to 7.15)AspirinIntravenous heparinPossible glycoprotein Ilb/Illa inhibitor with NSTEMIInsertion of pulmonary> artery cathetero Specific measuresPharmacologic supportSympathomimetic inotropes (eg, dopamine)Norepinephrine (for refractory hypotension)o Mechanical supportIABP, usually combined with percutaneous coronary' intervention or coronary artery' bypass graft surgery or possible thrombolytic therapyNewer devicesLeft ventricular or biventricular assist devicesPercutaneous cardiopulmonary-# bypasso Reperfusion/revascularizationPrimary percutaneous coronary interventionCoronary arteryr bypass graftThrombolytic therapy for patients not receiving PCI in a timely manner.",

Both quetiapine and ciprofloxacin can prolong the QT interval; in combination with possible hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia from HCTZ, this could have caused life-threatening polymorphic VT. The patient should be admitted for telemetry, and any electrolyte abnormality promptly treated. If the patient's QT remains prolonged, beta-blockers can be started and the patient can be assessed for ICD placement.An ICD is indicated in patients with symptomatic sustained (>30 seconds) ventricular tachycardia and in patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death (especially patients who have symptomatic heart failure and LVEF under 35%). ICD implantation would be premature in this patient until reversible abnormalities are corrected. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic that blocks cardiac potassium channels. It is used to treat ventricular fibrillation and sustained monomorphic VT but is less effective than IV magnesium and beta-blockers in polymorphic VT.

She complains of no associated chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness. The palpitations have occurred twice before, but they always stopped spontaneously after 5 minutes, and she cannot associate them with any triggers. The past health history is negative and she is not on any medications.On physical examination, the blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 160/min and regular. The heart and lung examinations are normal, and the ECG is shown in Figure below. The heart rate abruptly changes to 72/min after applying carotid sinus pressure. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "The patient most likely has PSVT, since the tachycardia terminates after carotid sinus massage (CSM). CSM increases vagal tone (parasympathetic) which decreases AV nodal conduction and terminates AV node re-entry arrhythmias. Sinus tachycardia differs from PSVT tachycardia in that it does not start or stop abruptly; it will slow down with CSM but will resume the previous rate once the maneuver is stopped. In PSVT, the QRS is usually narrow without clearly discernible P waves. The ECG does not support the other answers, since ventricular tachycardia is a regular wide complex rhythm, atrial flutter can be a regular narrow complex tachycardia but usually atrial flutter waves are seen, and finally atrial fibrillation is an irregular rhythm with no atrial activity. A wide QRS in PSVT can result from a preexisting bundle branch block, or a functional bundle branch block secondary to the tachycardia. This can make the distinction from a ventricular arrhythmia quite difficult.",

Incidence o While generally considered to have occurred infrequently the incidence of PCIS is not clear. o Before the era of reperfusion, the incidence was believed to be 3% patients post-M.I. o PCIS following MI have largely disappeared in the reperfusion era due to a decrease in the size of most M.I. Pathogenesis o Immunological factors are thoughts to be of primary importance. o Pathogenesis begins with cardiac injury and that stimulates antibody formation. The immune complexes that are generated are deposited into the pericardium, pleura, and lungs. Diagnosis o Diagnosis is made by characteristic symptoms and increased ESR.

The combination of elevated troponin and lack of ST segment elevation on ECG is most consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Initial therapy for acute coronary syndrome includes aspirin, nitroglycerin, anticoagulation, and morphine. An intravenous beta-blocker, such as metoprolol, is frequently given in the immediate management of ACS to decrease myocardial oxygen demand, limit infarct size, reduce pain, and decrease the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Elevated blood pressure also increases myocardial oxygen demand. Given this patient's increased blood pressure and continued pain, administration of a beta-blocker is the appropriate next step in his management. Administration of intravenous morphine would also be appropriate.Cardiac catheterization may well be necessary at some point during his evaluation, but there is no mortality benefit for emergent catheterization in NSTEMI. There is no role for thrombolytic therapy in patients with ACS without ST segment elevation. All patients with ACS should be admitted to a monitored cardiac unit with serial cardiac biomarkers to estimate the extent of cardiac damage, but the patient's continued pain demands urgent treatment, not just further observation. Clopidogrel therapy is indicated for patients with ACS who will not be undergoing immediate coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The principal goal of fibrinolysis is prompt restoration of full coronary arterial patency. The fibrinolytic agents tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase, tenecteplase (TNK), and reteplase (rPA) have been approved by the U.S. FDA for IV use in patients with STEMI. These drugs all act by promoting the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which subsequently lyses fibrin thrombi.# When assessed angiographically, flow in the culprit coronary artery is described by a simple qualitative scale called the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grading system:- Grade 0 indicates complete occlusion of the infarct-related artery;- Grade 1 indicates some penetration of the contrast material beyond the point of obstruction but without perfusion of the distal coronary bed;- Grade 2 indicates perfusion of the entire infarct vessel into the distal bed but with flow that is delayed compared with that of a normal artery; and- Grade 3 indicates full perfusion of the infarct vessel with normal flow.# While the upper time limit depends on specific factors in individual patients, it is clear that \"every minute counts\" and that patients treated within 1-3 h of the onset of symptoms generally benefit most. Although reduction of the mortality rate is more modest, the therapy remains of benefit for many patients seen 3-6 h after the onset of infarction, and some benefit appears to be possible up to 12 h, especially if chest discomfort is still present and ST segments remain elevated.# Compared with PCI for STEMI (primary PCI), fibrinolysis is generally the preferred reperfusion strategy for patients presenting in the first hour of symptoms, if there are logistical concerns about transportation of the patient to a suitable PCI center (experienced operator and team with a track record for a \"door-to-balloon\" time of <2 h), or there is an anticipated delay of at least 1 h between the time that fibrinolysis could be started versus implementation of PCI.# tPA and the other relatively fibrin-specific plasminogen activators, rPA and TNK, are more effective than streptokinase at restoring full perfusion--i.e., TIMI grade 3 coronary flow--and have a small edge in improving survival as well.# The current recommended regimen of tPA consists of a 15 mg bolus followed by 50 mg intravenously over the first 30 min, followed by 35 mg over the next 60 min.# Streptokinase is administered as 1.5 million units (MU) intravenously over 1 h.# rPA is administered in a double-bolus regimen consisting of a 10-MU bolus given over 2-3 min, followed by a second 10-MU bolus 30 min later.# TNK is given as a single weight-based intravenous bolus of 0.53 mg/kg over 10 s.# Pharmacologic reperfusion also typically involves adjunctive antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs.# Alternative pharmacologic regimens for reperfusion combine an intravenous glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa inhibitor with a reduced dose of a fibrinolytic agent.# Contraindications and Complications- Clear contraindications to the use of fibrinolytic agents include:* a history of cerebrovascular hemorrhage at any time, a nonhemorrhagic stroke or other cerebrovascular event within the past year, marked hypertension (a reliably determined systolic arterial pressure >180 mmHg and/or a diastolic pressure >110 mmHg) at any time during the acute presentation, suspicion of aortic dissection, and active internal bleeding (excluding menses). While advanced age is associated with an increase in hemorrhagic complications, the benefit of fibrinolytic therapy in the elderly appears to justify its use if no other contraindications are present and the amount of myocardium in jeopardy appears to be substantial.- Relative contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy, which require assessment of the risk. benefit ratio, include:* current use of anticoagulants (international normalized ratio ?2), a recent (<2 weeks) invasive or surgical procedure or prolonged (> 10 min) cardiopulmonary resuscitation, known bleeding diathesis, pregnancy, a hemorrhagic ophthalmic condition (e.g., hemorrhagic diabetic retinopathy), active peptic ulcer disease, and a history of severe hypertension that is currently adequately controlled. Because of the risk of an allergic reaction, patients should not receive streptokinase if that agent had been received within the preceding 5 days to 2 years.- Allergic reactions to streptokinase occur in ~2% of patients who receive it. While a minor degree of hypotension occurs in 4-10% of patients given this agent, marked hypotension occurs, although rarely, in association with severe allergic reactions.- Hemorrhage is the most frequent and potentially the most serious complication. Hemorrhagic stroke is the most serious complication and occurs in ~0.5-0.9% of patients being treated with these agentsLarge-scale trials have suggested that the rate of intracranial hemorrhage with tPA or rPA is slightly higher than with streptokinase.- Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography should be carried out after fibrinolytic therapy if there is evidence of either:* (1) failure of reperfusion (persistent chest pain and ST-segment elevation >90 min), in which case a rescue PCI should be considered; or* (2) coronary artery re-occlusion (re-elevation of ST segments and/or recur- rent chest pain) or the development of recurrent ischemia (such as recurrent angina in the early hospital course or a positive exercise stress test before discharge), in which case an urgent PCI should be considered.",

RHD is characterized principally by deforming fibrotic valvular disease, particularly involving the mitral valve.* Distinctive lesions occur in the heart, called Aschoffbodies, consisting of foci of T lymphocytes, occasional plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cells (pathognomonic for RF). These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to-ovoid nuclei (occasionally binucleate) in which the chromatin condenses into a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation \"caterpillar cells\").* During acute RF, diffuse inflammation and Aschoff bodies may be found in any of the three layers of the heart, resulting in pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis (pancarditis).* Inflammation of the endocardium and the left-sided valves typically results in fibrinoid necrosis within the cusps or tendinous cords. Overlying these necrotic foci and along the lines of closure are small (1 to 2 mm) vegetations, called verrucae.* Subendocardial lesions, perhaps exacerbated by regurgitant jets, can induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques, usually in the left atrium.* The cardinal anatomic changes of the mitral valve in chronic RHD are leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and short- ening, and thickening and fusion of the tendinous cords. In chronic disease the mitral valve is virtually always involved.* The mitral valve is affected in isolation in roughly two thirds of RHD, and along with the aortic valve in another 25% of cases. Tricuspid valve involvement is infrequent, and the pulmonary valve is only rarely affected.* Up to 60% of patients with ARF progress to RHD.* Valvular damage is the hallmark of rheumatic carditis. The mitral valve is almost always affected, sometimes together with the aortic valve; isolated aortic valve involvement is rare.* Early valvular damage leads to regurgitation. Over ensuing years, usually as a result of recurrent episodes, leaflet thickening, scarring, calcification, and valvular stenosis may develop.* Therefore the characteristic manifestation of carditis in previously unaffected individuals is mitral regurgitation, sometimes accompanied by aortic regurgitation.* Myocardial inflammation may affect electrical conduction pathways, leading to P-R interval prolongation (first- degree AV block or rarely higher-level block) and softening of the first heart sound.",

Since the patient has come to the hospital 24 hours after onset of symptoms, there will be no benefit from thrombolysis.\"Management of Patients with ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: In the absence of contraindications. it is reasonable to administer fibrinolytic therapy to patients with symptoms of STEMI beginning within the prior 12 to 24 hours who have continuing ischemic symptoms and electrocardiographic evidence of STEMI. Fibrinolytic therapy should not be administered to asymptomatic patients whose initial symptoms of STEMI began more than 24 hours earlier nor to patients whose 12-lead ECG shows only ST-segment depression, except if a true posterior myocardial infarction (MI) is suspected. \"\"Aspirin is essential in the management of patients with suspected STEMI and is effective across the entire spectrum of acute coronary syndromes Rapid inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 in platelets followed by a reduction of thromboxane A levels is achieved by buccal absorption of a chewed 160-325-mg tablet in the Emergency Department. This measure should be followed by daily oral administration of aspirin in a dose of 75-162 mg. \"-- Harrison 19/e p1603\"Morphine is a very effective analgesic for the pain associated with STEMI. However, it may reduce sympathetically mediated arteriolar and venous constriction, and the resulting venous pooling may reduce cardiac output and arterial pressure These hemodynamic disturbances usually respond promptly to elevation of the legs, but in some patients, volume expansion with intravenous saline is required. The patient may experience diaphoresis and nausea, but these events usually pass and are replaced by a feeling of well-being associated with the relief of pain. Morphine also has a vagotonic effect and may cause bradycardia or advanced degrees of heart block, particularly in patients with inferior infarction. These side effects usually respond to atropine (0.5 mg intravenously). Morphine is routinely administered by repetitive (every 5 min) intravenous injection of small doses (2--4 mg), rather than by the subcutaneous administration of a larger quantity; because absorption may be unpredictable by the latter route.-- Harrison 19/e p1603.Management of Patients with ST-segment Elevation Myocardial InfarctionPrehospital, emergency medical service providers should administer aspirin (162 to 325 mg) to all patients not already taking aspirin, obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients suspected of having STEMIQ, review a reperfusion checklist, and relay this information to a medical facility.Patients with STEMI who have cardiogenic shock, those with contraindications to lytics. and those at high-risk of dying because of heart failure should be channeled immediately to a facility capable of cardiac catheterizationQ.Initial Recognition and Evaluation in the Emergency DepartmentInitial evaluation in the emergency department focuses on identification of STEMI, early therapy, and reperfusion strategySelection of reperfusion strategy' depends on hospital and patient characteristics.Time to reperfusion therapy strongly influences outcomes in STEMI.Patients presenting to a hospital with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) capability should undergo PCI within 90 minutes of first medical contact as a systems goalQ.Patients with STEMI presenting to a non-PCI-capable hospital should be considered for transfer to a PCI-capable hospital based on patient characteristics time from symptom onset, and time to available PCI therapySTEMI patients presenting to a hospital without PCI capability and who cannot be transferred to a PCI center and undergo PCI within 90 minutes of first medical contact should receive fibrinolytic therapy within 30 minutes of hospital presentation as a systems goat in the absence of contraindications.If pharmacologic reperfusion is selected, fibrinolytic therapy should be administered to STEMI patients with symptom onset within the prior 12 hoursQ.In the absence of contraindications, it is reasonable to administer fibrinolytic therapy to patients with symptoms of STEMI beginning within the prior 12 to 24 hours who have continuing ischemic symptoms & electrocardiographic evidence of STEMIQ.Fibrinolytic therapy should not be administered to asymptomatic patients whose initial symptoms of STEMI began more than 24 hours earlier nor to patients whose 12-lead ECG show s only ST- segment depression, except if a true posterior myocardial infarction (MI) is suspectedQ.Patients should be evaluated for contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy such as a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), significant closed head or facial trauma within the past 3 months, uncontrolled hypertension, or ischemic stroke within the past 3 months.STEMI patients at substantial (4%) risk of ICH should be treated with PCI rather than with fibrinolytic therapyQ.",

Visible pulsations anywhere other than this expected location are abnormal. The left anterior chest wall may heave in patients with an enlarged or hyperdynamic left or right ventricle.# Physical examination in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension shows tachypnea, a prominent pulmonic S2 heart sound, palpable right ventricular heave, elevated jugular venous pressure, and dependent edema.# Many of the signs encountered in cor pulmonale are also present in HF patients with a depressed EF, including tachypnea, elevated jugular venous pressures, hepatomegaly, and lower-extremity edema. Patients may have prominent v waves in the jugular venous pulse as a result of tricuspid regurgitation. Other cardiovascular signs include an RV heave palpable along the left sternal border or in the epigastrium. The increase in intensity of the holosystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation with inspiration (\"Carvallo's sign\") may be lost eventually as RV failure worsens.

Even if the patient has evidence of pulmonary edema, fluid resuscitation remains the first intervention for hypotension from sepsis. She is more likely to die from hemodynamic collapse than from oxygenation issues related to pulmonary edema.Stress doses of hydrocortisone and intravenous norepinephrine are both used in patients with shock refractory to volume resuscitation but should be reserved until after the saline bolus. Vancomycin is a reasonable choice to cover enterococci, which can cause UTI-associated sepsis, but again would not address the immediate hemodynamic problem.
