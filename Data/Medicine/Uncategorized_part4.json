Urine is normally a sterile bodily fluid, not containing bacteria. Bacteria in the urine, especially gram-negative rods, usually indicate a urinary tract infection (either cystitis or pyelonephritis), although bacteriuria can also occur in prostatitis. Escherichia coli are the most common bacterium isolated from urine samples. Bacteria can be detected with a dipstick test for nitrite or by urinary microscopy, although bacterial culture remains the most specific and formal test (the golden standard). Bacteriuria can be confirmed if a single bacterial species is isolated in a concentration greater than 1,00,000 colony forming units per millilitre of urine in clean-catch midstream urine specimens (one for men, two consecutive specimens with the same bacterium for women). For urine collected bladder catheterisation, the threshold is 100 colony forming units of a single species per millilitre. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is bacteriuria without accompanying symptoms of a urinary tract infection (such as frequent urination, painful urination or fever). It is more common in women, in the elderly, in residents of long-term care facilities, and in patients with diabetes, bladder catheters and spinal cord injuries. Patients with a long-term Foley catheter uniformly show bacteriuria.",

This patient is best managed by subtotal gastrectomy + lymphadenectomy + distal pancreatectomy. Guidelines for management of Gastric carcinoma Surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment of gastric cancer either for cure or for palliation The extent of gastric resection depends on the site of tumor in the stomach. Tumors in the distal third or antrum of stomach require a subtotal gastrectomy (paial gastrectomy) while tumors of the middle or proximal third of the stomach require a total gastrectomy Distal Third /Antrurn Gastric cancer Middle Third /Proximal Gastric cancer Subtotal Gastrectomv Total Gastrectomy The extent of resection of adjacent structures (pancreas, spleen etc) depends on the location of primary tumor and local invasion Pancreatic Resection The distal pancreas should not be removed a pa of a resection for a cancer of the distal two third of the stomach (unless there is direct invasion) The distal pancreas should be removed only when there is direct invasion and still a chance of a curative procedure in patients with carcinoma of the proximal stomach Splenic resection Splenectomy is not indicated unless the tumor directly invades the spleen or involves the splenic hilar lymph nodes. Resection of spleen and splenic hilar lymph nodes may be considered in patients with tumors of the proximal stomach located in the greater curvature / posterior wall of the stomach close to the splenic hilum where the incidence of splenic hilar nodal involvement is likely to be high.",

In alcoholic hepatitis, in contrast to other causes of fatty liver, the AST and ALT are usually elevated two to seven fold. In general AST and ALT levels rise parallel to each other. In alcoholic liver disease the AST rises out of propoion to ALT such that the ratio of AST and ALT may become greater than 2. AST (SGOT) is therefore the single best answer. AST/ALT > 2:1 is suggestive of alcoholic liver disease. AST/ALT > 3 : 1 is highly suggestive of alcoholic liver disease.

Usually develops within the first 2-5 days after acute exposure to altitudes above 2500-3000 metres. It occurs in both unacclamatized and acclamatized inividual who ascends to high altitude from low. An excessive rise in pulmonary aery pressure preceding oedema formation is the crucial pathophysiological factor. Milder forms are; Acute mountain sickness Retinal hemorrhages Peripheral edema High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-threatening form of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema that occurs in otherwise healthy mountaineers at altitudes above 2,500 meters (8,200 feet). Predisposing factors: HAPE is seen in unacclamatized healthy persons. Acclamatized high altitude natives may also develop this syndrome upon return to high altitudes after a relatively brief visit at low altitudes. HAPE generally occurs 1-4 days after rapid ascent to altitudes. This is common under the age of 25 years. HAPE is rare in infants and small children. Cold weather and physical exeion at high altitude are other predisposing factors. Pathogenesis: HAPE belongs to a spectrum of High altitude illness. The initial insult that causes HAPE is excessive hypoxia caused by the lower air pressure at high altitudes. The mechanisms by which this shoage of oxygen causes HAPE are poorly understood, but two processes are believed to be impoant: Increased pulmonary aerial and capillary pressures (pulmonary hypeension) secondary to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. An idiopathic non-inflammatory increase in the permeability of the vascular endothelium. Clinical features: HAPE presents within 2-5 days of arrival at high altitude Early symptoms of HAPE include exeional dyspnoea, cough and reduced exercise performance. As pulmonary oedema progresses, cough worsens and breathlessness at rest and sometimes ohopnoea occur. Gurgling in the chest and pink frothy sputum indicate advanced cases. The clinical features are cyanosis, tachypnoea,tachycardia and elevated body temperature. Investigations: Chest radiographs and computed,tomographic scans of early HAPE show a patchy,peripheral distribution of edema. Prevention and treatment: Slow ascent is the most effective method of prevention, can often be prevented by use of dexamethasone, calcium channel blocking drugs, or long acting inhaled beta-2 adrenergic agonists. Treatment includes Descent from altitude, Bed rest Oxygen Inhaled nitric oxide Nifidipine.

It is also a stretch reflex.These are monosynaptic spinal segmental reflexes.When they are intact, integrity of the following is confirmed: cutaneous innervation, motor supply, and coical input to the corresponding spinal segment.This reflex is mediated by the S1 spinal segment of the spinal cord.",

Triclosan is an antibacterial and antifungal agent found in mumerous consumer products, including soaps, detergents, toys and surgical cleaning treatments. Its efficacy as an antimicrobial agent and the risk of antibacterial rasistance ramains controversial. Tests used for fat malabsorption Triolene breath test 13C triolene breath test is a simple and reproducible method to measure fat malabsorption. o It is a non invasive test and it does not require the use of radioactive isotopes. The 14C triolene breath test is sensitive and specific for measuring fat malabsorption but involve radiation exposure. 13C triolene is simple and effective that does not involve the use of radioactive isotopes. The substrate for this breath test is glycerol, esterified in three positions with the unsaturated 18:1 n-1 oleic acid. The absorption of triolene is dependent on efficient lipolysis, sufficient intraluminal bile salt concentration and intact intestinal mucosa. A low 13C breath excretion represents probable contribution of all these factors. The Tripalmitin breath test :? The substrate is glycerol esterified with 16:0 fatty acid palmitic acid. The oxidation of CO2 is determined by hydrolysis, bile salt concentration and absorption through intestine. C Mixed-Triglyceride Breath Test The \"C mixed-triglyceride (MTG) breath test is a noninvasive test with which to measure lipase activity. The test molecule, 1,3 distearyl, 2 (carboxyl-\"C) octanoyl glycerol, consists of a medium-chain fatty acid octanoic acid marked with \"C in the 2-position and the long-chain fatty acid 18:0 in the 1- and 3-position. The rationale of the test is that the two stearyl groups have to be split off the glycerol by lipase before \"C octanoyl monoglyceride or 13C octanoate, a medium-chain fatty acid, is absorbed and rapidly metabolized to \"CO2, which appears in breath. The rate-limiting step in the oxidation of '3CO2is the hydrolysis of the fatty acids in the 1- and 3-positions of the mixed triglyceride. The amount of '3CO2 that appears in breath is an indicator of lipase activity. After an overnight fast, two basal breath samples are taken. The test meal, a slice of white bread with chocolate paste (containing 250 mg 13C MTG), is ingested. After the meal, breath samples are collected at 30-min intervals for a period of 6h. LIC-Trioctanoin Breath Test The substrate for the trioctanoin breath test is glycerol, esterified with the 8:0 medium-chain fatty acid, octanoic acid. Because the absorption of MCT is independent of bile salts and occurs immediately after hydrolysis by pancreatic lipase, absorption can be limited only by insufficient lipolysis. This test allows discrimination between patients with pancreatic insufficiency and patients with bile acid deficiency or mucosal abnormalities.",

Direct thrombin inhibitors (Lepirudin and Argobatram) are usually preferred but all three drugs are effective anticoagulants and the choice of drug depends on personal experience and patient characteristics like hepatic or renal insufficiency and desired route of administration Heparin administration should be stopped immediately. Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) should not be substituted because it may cross react with and-heparin antibodies Warfarin should not be used until the thrombocytopenia is resolved and the patient is adequately anticoagulated with another agent.

Therefore low-osmolar or iso-osmolar nonionic contrast media are recommended in high-risk patients to reduce the risk of contrast medium-induced nephropathy. Note: No benefit has been demonstrated in those without renal dysfunction.

The annual incidence of this idiopathic disorder is ~25 per 100,000 annually, or about 1 in 60 persons in a lifetime. Risk factors include pregnancy and diabetes mellitus.\u00a0\nClinical Manifestations\u00a0\nThe onset of Bell's palsy is fairly abrupt, with maximal weakness being attained by 48 hrs as a general rule. Pain behind the ear may precede the paralysis for a day or two. Taste sensation may be lost unilaterally, and hyperacusis may be present. In some cases, there is mild cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal swelling and uniform enhancement of the geniculate ganglion and facial nerve and, in some cases, entrapment of the swollen nerve in the temporal bone. Approximately 80% of patients recover within a few weeks or months. Electromyography may be of some prognostic value; evidence of denervation after 10 days indicates there has been axonal degeneration, that there will be a long delay (3 months as a rule) before regeneration occurs, and that it may be incomplete. The presence of incomplete paralysis in the first week is the most favorable prognostic sign. Recurrences are reported in approximately 7% of cases.\u00a0\nNote: Persistence of the stapedial reflex is considered as favourable prognosis.\nRef: Harrisson Principles of Internal Medicine Ed 19th Pg 2647",

So when treating dyslipidemia for reducing cardiovascular events, the first\u00a0target is LDL and\nnot HDL.\nDoubt and Controversy\nWhat is creating doubts in our mind is a table from Braunwald 8th/e p1008 according to which \u2018Low HDL\u2019 appears to\nbe better marker for prediction of future cardiovascular disease than \u2018High LDL\u2019\nAccording to this bar diagram in Braunnwald 8th/e pl008 - the adjusted hazard ratio for future cardiovascular events\nfor LDL is 1.62 while that of HDL is 2.32. But the text given in the book does clarify which one is better marker, (we\nhave given this table from Braunwald in our previous discussion on this topic in Nov 2009 Medicine).\nWe have tried to confirm\u00a0this \u2018Low HDL\u2019 fact from various other books. But none of the texts clearly favored any one\nbetween these 2 to be the better marker. Both LDL and HDL are mentioned to be important.\nWe have also consulted several cardiologist on this. All of them say that the answer should be LDL.\nWell, Braunwald is text book of immense reputation, and any information or text given in the book does not need\nconfirmation\u00a0from any other source. But what has added to the confusion is that the latest edition of Braunwald i.e.,\n9th/e has eliminated that diagram from the book and in the text have not clarified\u00a0which one is better marker.\nInstead, the text states that Apolipo (a) and B 100 are better marker for predicting future cardiovascular events than\nLDL and HDL.\nWe are not absolutely sure of the answer, but we would for the time being go with LDL.\nAlso Know\nThe following lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are associated with increased coronary risk.\nElevated total cholesterol\nElevated LDL cholesterol\nLow HDL cholesterol\nIncreased total to HDL cholesterol ratio\nIncreased non HDL cholesterol\nHypertriglyceridemia\nIncreased Lp(a)\nIncreased apolipoprotein B\nSmall dense LDL particles",

B: Increased RBC surface area It's the only condition presenting with Increased MCHC Spherocytosis is caused by a molecular defect in one or more of the proteins of the red blood cell cytoskeleton, including, spectrin, ankyrin so blood cell contracts to its most surface-tension efficient and least flexible configuration, a sphere( spherocytes). They have a high osmotic fragility and are more prone to physical degradation. They are most commonly found in immunologically-mediated hemolytic anemias and in hereditary spherocytosis, but the former would have a positive direct Coombs test and the latter would not. The misshapen but otherwise healthy red blood cells are mistaken by the spleen for old or damaged red blood cells and it thus constantly breaks them down, causing a cycle whereby the body destroys its own blood supply (auto-hemolysis). Chronic symptoms include anemia and splenomegaly. As a result of the broken-down blood cells -- bilirubin -- accumulates in the gallbladder and can cause pigmented gallstones to develop. In peripheral blood smears, red blood cells will appear abnormally small. The CBC will show elevated MCHC. The bone marrow in its role of manufacturing red blood cells will display hyperplasia, the increased activity of replacing RBCs. As a result, immature red blood cell or reticulocyte counts will appear elevated.",

The patient may describe a shade dropping in front of the eye or describe vision like looking through ground glass. If a thrombus propagates up the carotid to the middle cerebral aery, then symptoms seen in middle cerebral aery occlusion or embolization (hemiparesis with sensory symptoms, aphasia depending on hemispheric dominance) will also occur. Midbasilar aery disease produces weakness and sensory loss with diplopia, loss of facial sensation or movement, and ataxia. Branches of the basilar aery supply the base of the pons and superior cerebellum. The symptoms described suggest disease in the posterior circulation, whichincludes paired veebral aeries, the basilar aery, and the paired posterior cerebral aeries. The basilar aery divides into two posterior cerebral aeries that provide branches to the cerebellum, medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and temporal and occipital lobes. A midbasilar aery occlusion could cause ataxia of limbs by involving pontine nuclei; paralysis of the face, arm, and leg by involving coicospinal tracts; and impairment of facial sensation by involvement of fifth nerve nucleus. Occlusion of the entire middle cerebral aery results in contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, and homonymous hemianopsia. When the dominant hemisphere is involved, aphasia is present. When the nondominant hemisphere is involved, apraxia and neglect are produced. When only a penetrating branch of the middle cerebral aery is affected, the syndrome of pure motor hemiplegia is produced, as the infarct involves only the posterior limb of the internal capsule, involving only motor fibers to the face, arm, and leg (lacunar infarct).",

        "exp": "A heterozygous individual with HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4 has a 33-fold greater relative risk for developing diabetes than individuals without these two HLA antigens. Homozygous individuals with HLA-B27 are more likely to develop ankylosing spondylitis and Reiter's disease. Patients who are homozygous for HLA-DR2 have a reduced risk of diabetes mellitus. Individuals with the HLA-DR4 allele have an increased risk of diabetes. Heterozygotes for HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR4 likely have an intermediate risk. Ref: Vella A. (2011). Chapter 139.
