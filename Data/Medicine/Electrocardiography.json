Several clues in this tracing suggest the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia.* When ventricular tachycardia occurs, ventricular depolarization does not conduct through the normal His-Purkinje system but rather conducts slowly directly through ventricular myocardium. During some ventricular tachycardias, sinus node depolarization continues unabated, and most of the sinus impulses meet a refractory ventricle due to the dominant ectopic ventricular activity preventing conduction.",

So there is overlap and also a short time iag between these two wave forms.This is very important to recognise as, even if the RA conduction is prolonged in pathology the RA component of P- wave still falls within the LA wave.Hence it is not shown in the ECG and P wave is not widened in RA enlargement.This is in contrast to LA enlargement, when the terminal half of P vector delayed it stretches the P wave wide beyond the normal 100ms. Hence LAE widens the P wave.P wave becomes taller in RA enlargemento In classical P pulmonale, the P wave is tall > 2.5 mm.o It is easy to explain why it not getting wide than why it is gettingtaller.The atrial vector has two components.The initial RA vector, is directed anteriorly. The main reason is due to the anatomical proximity of RA to the chest wall. Further the atrial electrical dp/dt is fast, so the slope of forward limb is steep. Any R.4 voltage increase is easily picked up by the chest leads.LAE can not produce tall P waveo The left atrial vector which follows RA vector is mainly directed posteriorly and hence inscribe a descending limb ofP wave.o This causes the P terminal force.o So the direction of vector forces and the anatomical locality' make a tall and positive P deflection highly improbable in LAE.",

The PR interval is prolonged to 200 milliseconds consistent with borderline first-degree AV block. The QRS axis and intervals are normal.ST elevations with concave upward morphology are seen in I and aVL, II and aVF, and V2 through V6. No Q waves are present. Furthermore, subtle PR-segment depression is seen in leads I and II. The differential diagnosis for ST-segment elevation includes, among other things, acute myocardial infarction, pericarditis, and left ventricular aneurysm. In this case, the upward concavity of the ST segment, the PR-segment depression, the lack of Q waves, and the diffuse nature of the ST-segment elevation in more than one coronary artery distribution make pericarditis the likely etiology. Patients with pericarditis will complain of chest pain, typically described as sharp and pleuritic. Radiation is to the trapezius ridge. The pain is improved with sitting up and leaning forward and worsened by leaning backward.",
