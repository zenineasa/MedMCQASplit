        "exp": "This person has benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is characterized by sudden-onset brief episodes of vertigo lasting less than a minute. The symptoms are usually brought on by head movement. The cause is commonly attributed to calcium debris in the semicircular canals, known as canalithiasis. The debris is loose otoconia (calcium carbonate) within the utricular sac. Although BPPV can occur after head trauma, there is usually no obvious precipitating factor. It generally abates spontaneously and can be treated with vestibular rehabilitation. Basilar migraine can cause vertigo, but it is not brought on by movement, there is an associated headache and lasts longer than the 30 seconds noticed in this patient. Brainstem ischemic events or cerebellar tumors can cause vertigo but the symptoms are persistent and not intermittent. Finally, Meniere disease also causes vertigo but there is associated hearing changes, and the symptoms last longer than in BPPV.",

First 48 hoursTransient ischemic attack (TIA) is sudden, transitory loss of neurologic function that comes on without headache and resolves spontaneously within 24 hours (but usually lasts less than 1 hour), leaving no neurologic sequelae.The specific symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected, which is in turn related to the vessels involved. The most common origin is high-grade stenosis (>=70%) of the internal carotid, or ulcerated plaque at the carotid bifurcation.Stroke may be indistinguishable from a TIA at the time of presentation: Duration of symptoms is the determining difference.Symptoms are transient with a TIA because reperfusion occurs, either because of collateral circulation or because of the breaking up of an embolus.The blockage in blood flow does not last long enough to cause permanent infarction.Once a patient has a TIA, there is a high risk of stroke in 10-15% in the first 3 months, with most events occurring in the first 2 days. The risk of a stroke in a patient with a history of TIA is about 10% per year. TIAs carry a 30% 5-year risk of stroke. Therefore, cardiac risk factors should be closely investigated and, if possible, eliminated in a patient who has had a TIA.Cases may present only with transient loss of vision in one eye, known as amaurosis fugax. This happens during a transient ischemic attack because the first branch of the internal carotid artery is the ophthalmic artery.Note:TIAs are never due to hemorrhage; hemorrhages do not resolve in 24 hours.The importance of TIAs is that they are predictors of stroke, and timely elective carotid endarterectomy may prevent or minimize that possibility.Workup starts with.noninvasive Duplex studies.Carotid endarterectomy is indicated if the lesions are found in the location that explains the neurologic symptoms.Angioplasty and stent can be performed in high risk surgical patients",

On physical examination, she has no loss of reflexes, sensation, or coordination. Which of the following is the likely pathogenesis of this disease?",
        "exp": "The disease process described is myasthenia gravis (MG), a neuromuscular disease marked by muscle weakness and fatigability. Myasthenia gravis results from a reduction in the number of junctional acetylcholine receptors as a result of autoantibodies. Antibodies cross-link these receptors, causing increased endocytosis and degradation in lysosomes. A decreased number of available acetylcholine receptors results in decreased efficiency of neuromuscular transmission. MG patients also have autoantibodies against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) receptors. MG presents with weakness and fatigability, particularly of cranial muscles, causing diplopia, ptosis, nasal speech, and dysarthria. Proximal limb weakness also occurs. Diseases of the central nervous system (poliomyelitis, Friedreich ataxia, or multiple sclerosis, as in the option b, c, and d) cause changes in reflexes, sensation, or coordination. ALS, a pure motor disorder, causes fasciculations and muscle atrophy as a result of lower motor neuron involvement. McArdle disease, a glycogen storage disease, causes muscle cramping and occasionally rhabdomyolysis with heavy exertion but only very rarely with usual daily activities.Ten percent of myasthenia patients have thymic tumors. Surgical removal of a thymoma is necessary because of local tumor spread. Even in the absence of tumor, 85% of patients clinically improve after thymectomy. It is common practice to perform thymectomy in most patients with generalized MG who are between puberty and age 55.",

His wife tells you that he has no ongoing medical problems, does not take any medications, and does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. On examination the patient is drowsy, has a tongue laceration, and his pants are wet with urine. Serum electrolytes (including sodium and calcium) are normal and urine drug screen is negative. Which of the following is the best next step in evaluation?",
        "exp": "Though syncope is often due to a cardiovascular cause, the presence of a tongue laceration and urinary incontinence suggest syncope due to a seizure. Furthermore, patients with syncope due to cardiac causes usually recover normal mentation within a few minutes. Prolonged drowsiness is a common postictal phenomenon that can follow a generalized seizure. These findings all point to the likelihood of an unwitnessed seizure in this patient. New-onset seizure in a young person is often idiopathic or related to substance abuse (amphetamine or cocaine), but seizures that begin in older adults are worrisome for structural brain disease. The evaluation of a new seizure in an older adult includes an electroencephalogram (EEG) to confirm the diagnosis, even though the EEG will be nondiagnostic in about one-half of patients. An MRI is the best test to look for structural brain disease, such as a brain tumor, old stroke, brain abscess, or vascular malformation. Even small lesions can provide the trigger for a seizure, so the more sensitive MRI is preferred to CT scanning in this circumstance. Though often performed, routine blood tests are rarely helpful in the evaluation of seizures. Lumbar puncture is performed only if meningitis or encephalitis is suspected. Holter monitoring is used to detect rhythm disturbances that can be associated with syncope, but cardiac syncope is rarely associated with seizures. Another cause of cardiac syncope is aortic stenosis that could be detected by echocardiography, but syncope associated with aortic stenosis is almost never associated with seizures.",

        "exp": "Ans. A. 3-Hz spike-and-waves. (Ref. H - 17th/pg. 2498-2500, 2504-2505; 444).Harrison's 17th/pg. 2549.......\"The electrophysiologic hallmark of typical absence seizures is a generalized, symmetric, 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharge that begins and ends suddenly, superimposed on a normal EEG background\"Absence Seizures (Petit Mai)# \"The electrophysiologic hallmark of typical absence seizures is a generalized, symmetric, 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharge that begins and ends suddenly, superimposed on a normal EEG background\".# Periods of spike- and-wave discharges lasting more than a few seconds usually correlate with clinical signs, but the EEG often shows many more brief bursts of abnormal cortical activity than were suspected clinically.# Hyperventilation tends to provoke the electrographic discharges and even seizures and is used during EEG.# The episodic generalized spike-wave activity that occurs during and between seizures in patients with typical absence epilepsy contrasts with focal interictal epileptiform discharges or ictal patterns found in patients with complex partial seizures.Atypical Absence Seizures# have features that deviate both clinically and electrophysiologically from typical absence seizures.# For example, the lapse of consciousness is usually of longer duration and less abrupt in onset and cessation, and the seizure is accompanied by more obvious motor signs that may include focal or lateralizing features.# The EEG shows a generalized, slow spike-and-wave pattern with a frequency of <2-5/s, as well as other abnormal activity.Complex Partial Seizures# The routine interictal (i.e., between seizures) EEG in patients with complex partial seizures is often normal or may show brief discharges termed epileptiform spikes, or sharp waves.# Since complex partial seizures can arise from the medial temporal lobe or inferior frontal lobe, i.e., regions distant from the scalp, the EEG recorded during the seizure may be nonlocalizing.Generalized, Tonic-Clonic Seizures (Grand Mai)# The EEG during the tonic phase of the seizure shows a progressive increase in generalized low-voltage fast activity, followed by generalized high-amplitude, polyspike discharges.# In the clonic phase, the high-amplitude activity is typically interrupted by slow waves to create a spike-and-wave pattern. The postictal EEG shows diffuse slowing that gradually recovers as the patient awakens.Atonic Seizures# Atonic seizures are characterized by sudden loss of postural muscle tone lasting 1-2 s. Consciousness is briefly impaired, but there is usually no postictal confusion.# A very brief seizure may cause only a quick head drop or nodding movement, while a longer seizure will cause the patient to collapse. This can be extremely dangerous, since there is a substantial risk of direct head injury with the fall.# The EEG shows brief, generalized spike-and-wave discharges followed immediately by diffuse slow waves that correlate with the loss of muscle tone.Myoclonic Seizures# Myoclonus is a sudden and brief muscle contraction that may involve one part of the body or the entire body.# A normal, common physiologic form of myoclonus is the sudden jerking movement observed while falling asleep. Pathologic myoclonus is most commonly seen in association with metabolic disorders, degenerative CNS diseases, or anoxic brain injury.# Although the distinction from other forms of myoclonus is imprecise, myoclonic seizures are considered to be true epileptic events since they are caused by cortical (versus subcortical or spinal) dysfunction.# The EEG may show bilaterally synchronous spike-and-wave discharges synchronized with the myoclonus, although these can be obscured by movement artifact.LENNOX-GASTAUT SYNDROMELennox-Gastaut syndrome occurs in children and is defined by the following triad:1) multiple seizure types (usually including generalized tonic-clonic, atonic, and atypical absence seizures);2) an EEG showing slow (<3 Hz) spike-and-wave discharges and a variety of other ab- normalities; and3) impaired cognitive function in most but not all cases.Partial (focal) seizuresAffect one area of the brain. Most commonly originate in medial temporal lobe. Often preceded by seizure aura; can secondarily generalize. Types:# Simple partial (consciousness intact)-- motor, sensory, autonomic, psychic# Complex partial (impaired consciousness).Generalized seizuresDiffuse. Types:# Absence (petit mal)--3 Hz, no postictal confusion, blank stare# Myoclonic--quick, repetitive jerks# Tonic-clonic (grand mal)--alternating stiffening and movement# Tonic--stiffening# Atonic--\"drop\" seizures (fails to floor); commonly mistaken for faintingAdditional Educational points:EEG:# NORMAL:- The frequencies most brain waves range from are 0.5-500 Hz; imp categories are-* Alpha waves - 8-13 Hz* Beta waves - Greater than 13 Hz* Theta waves - 3.5-7.5 Hz* Delta waves - 3 Hz or less- In normal awake adults lying quietly with the eyes closed, an 8- to 13-Hz alpha rhythm is seen posteriorly in the EEG, intermixed with a variable amount of generalized faster (beta) activity (>13 Hz); the alpha rhythm is attenuated when the eyes are opened. During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm is also attenuated; with light sleep, slower activity in the theta (4-7 Hz) and delta (<4 Hz) ranges becomes more conspicuous.Some more Specific diagnostic patterns of EEG: PatternDiagnostic ofComments1Periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges (PLEDs)acute focal cerebral insult like HSVif bilateral diagnostic of HSV2Periodic high voltage with 4-15 secs separation with accompanying body jerks, no change with painful stimulation.Pathognomoic of SSPEd/d is PCP overdose3Myoclonic jerks with bilateral sharp wave 1.5-2 / secs (early = slowing; later=triphasic).Creutzfeldt Jakob diseaseMay resemble PLEDs, but contrary to them in CJD are not reactive to painful stimuli.4Triphasic wavesMay be seen in hepatic enceph, postanoxia, hyponatremiaNot a specific pattern",

        "exp": "Dizziness is a nonspecific symptom that may refer to several different sensations, including impending faint, spinning sensation, or impaired balance. A sensation of spinning or rotation is referred to as vertigo and may be due to central or peripheral causes. Peripheral causes of vertigo are usually associated with nystagmus and more troublesome to the patient but are not due to life-threatening disease. The commonest cause of peripheral vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which characteristically begins in middle-age persons, occurs with sudden changes of position, and is thought to be due to cellular debris in the semicircular canals. The diagnosis is supported by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, where the patient is moved quickly from a sitting to a lying position with head turned and hanging below the horizontal plane. The occurrence of dizziness and horizontal nystagmus after a few second latency period constitutes a positive test. This patient's symptoms are not brought on by standing; so orthostatic hypotension is unlikely. Meniere disease is a chronic disease of both the labyrinth and the cochlea; so progressive unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus are usually present. Acoustic neuroma is also a chronic (rather than episodic) condition associated with hearing loss, unsteadiness of gait, and loss of corneal reflex on the affected side. Central causes of vertigo (vertebrobasilar stroke, cerebellar hemorrhage) cause constant (rather than intermittent) symptoms and are associated with ataxia and focal CNS signs. The Dix-Hallpike test in brainstem disorders causes immediate vertigo (i.e., no latent period) and often vertical or rotatory nystagmus.",

The patient had been admitted to the intensive care unit 2 weeks ago because of septic shock related to alcoholism, pneumonia, and Klebsiella bacteremia. He had developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation as well as acute kidney injury. His pulmonary infiltrates had responded to appropriate intravenous antibiotics and his hypotension had responded to intravenous norepinephrine. Now the patient is alert and responsive to verbal commands, is afebrile with blood pressure of 114/74 but has not tolerated several trials of weaning from the ventilator. On physical examination, the patient is cooperative. Cranial nerves are normal. Muscle strength is poor, especially in distal musculature, where he displays only 2/5 strength in the hands and feet. Proximal strength is 3/5. Ankle and knee reflexes are unobtainable. Sensory examination is difficult because of problems communicating with the patient but suggests distal sensory loss in the lower extremities. Laboratory studies show that his creatinine level has spontaneously improved to 2.4 mg/dL. Electrolytes are normal, and the patient has a mild normochromic normocytic anemia with resolving leukocytosis. Serum creatine kinase is 78 units/L (normal <140).

It typically presents with motor weakness and difficulty in weaning the patient from the ventilator. Cranial nerves are spared. Distal reflex loss, sensory changes in neuropathic distribution, and normal CK help distinguish it from critical care myopathy. Both conditions can coexist in the same patient and distinction between the two conditions may not be important, as treatment of both conditions is supportive. Patients usually improve slowly with time, but prolonged dependence on the ventilator as well as weakness and sensory loss lasting months or years often occur. The cause of critical care polyneuropathy is unknown, but axonal degeneration on nerve conduction studies is characteristic.Loss of myosin characterizes the closely related condition of critical care myopathy, but sensory changes and reflex loss would not be anticipated in a myopathic process. Neuromuscular blockade again would not cause sensory and reflex changes. Thiamine deficiency can be provoked in a malnourished patient (such as one suffering from chronic alcoholism) but would be associated with nystagmus, ataxia, and mental status changes rather than distal weakness and neuropathy. Demyelination (rather than axonal degeneration) is associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome, but this condition would be very unlikely in this ICU patient without antecedent viral or Campylobacter infection.",

However, because high doses of anticonvulsants are required for pain relief, sedation is very common.# Sedation is also a problem with the tricyclic antidepressants but is much less of a problem with serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, e.g., venlafaxine and duloxetine).# Thus, in elderly or in those whose daily activities need high-level mental activity, these drugs should be the first line.# In contrast, opioid medications should be used as a second- or third-line drug class. While highly effective for many painful conditions, opioids are sedating, and their effect tends to lessen over time, leading to dose escalation and, occasionally, a worsening of pain due to physical dependence.Treatment of Painful NeuropathyFirst-Line TherapySecond-Line TherapyAntidepressantsOpioidsTricyclicOxycodone 40-160 mg qdAmitriptyline, nortriptyline, imipramine,Morphine 90-360 mg qd POdesimipramine, doxepin (10-150 mg qd)Tramadol 50-400 mg qdSerotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI)Fentanyl patch 25-75 g/h q 3 daysDuloxetine (60-120 mg qd)AntiarrhythmicsVenlafaxine (150-225 mg qd)Mexilitine 600-1200 mg qdAntiepilepticsTopicalCarbamazepine 100-800 mg qdCapsaicin 0.075% topical tid or qidOxcarabazepine 1200-2400 mg qdLidocaine 5% patch bidLamotrigine 200-400 mg qdIsosorbide dinitrate spray 30 mg qhsTopiramate 300-400 mg qdOthersGabapentin 900-3600 mg qdClonidine 0.1-2.4 mg qdPregabalin 150-600 mg qdMemantine 55 mg qdValproic acid 1000-1200 mg qdDextromethorphan 400 mg Levodopa 100 mg tid Alpha-lipoic acid (thioctic acid) 600 mg Spinal cord stimulator Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant initially studied in the setting of herpetic neuralgia, is now the first-line treatment for neuropathic pain from a variety of causes. It is begun at 100-300 mg bid or tid, with 50-100% dose increments every 3 days. Usually 900-3600 mg/d in two or three doses is effective. One potential side effect to be aware of is confusion and drowsiness, especially in the elderly. Other effective adjuvant medications include pregabalin, which has the same mechanism of action as gabapentin but is more efficiently absorbed from the GI tract. Pregabalin, another newer anticonvulsant is also effective for a broad range of neuropathic pains.Educational TablePainful Conditions that Respond to Tricyclic Antidepressants# Postherpetic neuralgia# Diabetic neuropathy# Tension headache# Migraine headache# Rheumatoid arthritis# Chronic low back pain# Cancer # Central post-stroke pain",

        "exp": "(D) Polymerase chain reaction # DNA amplification is done by PCR> Blotting technique Following gel electrophoresis, probes are often used to detect specific molecules from the mixture. However, probes cannot be applied directly to the gel. The problem can be solved by three types of blotting methods: Southern blotting, Northern blotting and Western blotting. Southern blotting is a technique for detecting specific DNA fragments in a complex mixture. Northern blotting is used for detecting RNA fragments, instead of DNA fragments. Western blotting is used to detect a particular protein in a mixture. The probe used is therefore not DNA or RNA, but antibodies. The technique is also called \"immunoblotting\" PCR: In vitro Techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction allow the amplification of specific DNA sequences so that minute quantities of foreign nucleic acids can be recognized in host specimens. Recombinant DNA refers to a collection of techniques for creating (and analyzing) DNA molecules that contain DNA from two unrelated organisms. One of the DNA molecules is typically a bacterial or viral DNA that is capable of accepting another DNA molecule; this is called a vector DNA. The other DNA molecule is from an organism of interest, which could be anything from a bacterium to a whale, or a human. Combining these two DNA molecules allows for the replication of many copies of a specific DNA. These copies of DNA can be studied in detail, used to produce valuable proteins, or used for gene therapy or other applications. Electrophoresis, also called cataphoresis, is the motion of dispersed particles relative to a fluid under the influence of a spatially uniform electric field. This electrokinetic phenomenon was observed for the first time in 1807 by Reuss , who noticed that the application of a constant electric field caused clay particles dispersed in water to migrate. It is ultimately caused by the presence of a charged interface between the particle surface and the surrounding fluid.",

In most patients, no obvious predisposing cause is found, but several genetic loci have been associated with it (12ql2-q21, 14ql3-q31, 9p24-p22, 2q33, and 20pl3).# Symptoms may resolve with correction of coexisting iron-deficiency anemia and often respond to dopamine agonists, levodopa, diazepam, clonazepam, gabapentin, or opiates.# Dopaminergic therapy is the preferred treatment for restless legs syndrome and should be initiated with long-acting dopamine agonists (eg, pramipexole 0.125-0.75 mg or ropinirole 0.25-4.0 mg once daily) to avoid the augmentation that may be associated with levodopa-carbidopa (100/25 or 200/50 taken about 1 hour before bedtime).# Augmentation refers to the earlier onset or enhancement of symptoms; earlier onset of symptoms at rest; and a briefer response to medication. When augmentation occurs in patients receiving an agonist, the daily dose should be lowered or divided, or opioids substituted. Oxycodone is often effective; the dose is individualized.# Gabapentin is an alternative to opioids.Initial dopamine agonists were ergot derivatives (e.g., bromocriptine, pergolide, cabergoline) and were associated with ergot-related side effects, including cardiac valvular damage. They have largely been replaced by a second generation of non-ergot dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). In general, dopamine agonists do not have comparable efficacy to levodopa.Evaluation of the Patient with the Complaint of Excessive Daytime SomnolenceFindings on History and Physical ExaminationDiagnostic EvaluationDiagnosisTherapyObesity, snoring, hypertensionPolysomnography with respiratory monitoringObstructive sleep apneaContinuous positive airway pressure; ENT surgery (e.g., uvulopalatopharyngoplasty); dental appliance; pharmacologic therapy (e.g., protriptyline); weight lossCataplexy, hypnogogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, family historyPolysomnography with multiple sleep latency testingNarcolepsy- cataplexy syndromeStimulants (e.g., modafinil, methylphenidate); REM-suppressant antidepressants (e.g., protriptyline); genetic counselingRestless legs, disturbed sleep, predisposing medical condition {e.g., iron deficiency or renal failure)Assessment for predisposing medical conditionsRestless legs syndromeTreatment of predisposing condition, if possible; dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole, ropinirole)Disturbed sleep, predisposing medical conditions (e.g., ioralasthma), and/or predisposing medical therapies (e.g., theophylline)Sleep-wake diary recordingInsomnias (see text)Treatment of predisposing condition and/ or change in therapy, if possible; behav-therapy; short-acting benzodiazepine receptor agonist (e.g., zolpidem)",

        "exp": "Ans. a (Facial nerve). (Ref. Harrison-medicine, 18th/Chapter 376.)Bell's palsy# The most common form of facial paralysis is Bells palsy. Bell's palsy is idiopathic palsy of facial nerve.Clinical Manifestations# The onset of Bell's palsy is fairly abrupt, maximal weakness being attained by 48 h as a general rule.# Pain behind the ear may precede the paralysis for a day or two.# Taste sensation may be lost unilaterally, and hyperacusis may be present.# In some cases there is mild cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis.# MRI may reveal swelling and uniform enhancement of the geniculate ganglion and facial nerve, and, in some cases, entrapment of the swollen nerve in the temporal bone.# Approximately 80% of patients recover within a few weeks or months.# The presence of incomplete paralysis in the first week is the most favorable prognostic sign.Pathophysiology# Bell's palsy is associated with the presence of herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA in endoneurial fluid and posterior auricular muscle, suggesting that a reactivation of this virus in the geniculate ganglion may be responsible. However, a causal role for herpes simplex virus in Bell's palsy is unproven.Differential Diagnosis# Tumors that invade the temporal bone (carotid body, cholesteatoma, dermoid).# The Ramsay Hunt syndrome, presumably due to herpes zoster of the geniculate ganglion, consists of a severe facial palsy associated with a vesicular eruption in the pharynx, external auditory canal, and other parts of the cranial integument; often the eighth cranial nerve is affected as well.# Acoustic neuromas frequently involve the facial nerve by local compression.# Infarcts, demyelinating lesions of multiple sclerosis, and tumors are the common pontine lesions that interrupt the facial nerve fibers; other signs of brainstem involvement are usually present.# Bilateral facial paralysis (facial diplegia) occurs in Guillain-Barre' syndrome and also in a form of sarcoidosis known as uveoparotid fever (Heerfordt syndrome).# Lyme disease is a frequent cause of facial palsies in endemic areas.# The rare Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome consists of a triad of recurrent facial paralysis, recurrent--and eventually permanent--facial (particularly labial) edema, and less constantly, plication of the tongue;# Leprosy frequently involves the facial nerve, and facial neuropathy may also occur in diabetes mellitus.# All these forms of nuclear or peripheral facial palsy must be distinguished from the supranuclear type.# In the latter, the frontalis and orbicularis oculi muscles are involved less than those of the lower part of the face, since the upper facial muscles are innervated by corticobulbar pathways from both motor cortices, whereas the lower facial muscles are innervated only by the opposite hemisphere.Treatment# Symptomatic measures include use of paper tape to depress the upper eyelid during sleep and prevent corneal drying, and Massage of the weakened muscles.# A course of glucocorticoids, given as prednisone 60 to 80 mg daily during the first 5 days and then tapered over the next 5 days, appears to shorten the recovery period and modestly improve the functional outcome.# In one double-blind study, patients treated within 3 days of onset with both prednisone and acyclovir (400 mg five times daily for 10 days) had a better outcome than patients treated with prednisone alone.",

Of the cranial neuralgias, trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) is the most common and typically occurs in middle-aged patients. Earlier onset can indicate underlying multiple sclerosis. The pain usually occurs unilaterally in the second or third division of the trigeminal nerve and is classically precipitated by light touch of the face. The first-line treatment is carbamazepine, but about one-third of patients do not respond to medical treatment and require invasive management such as microvascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is much less common, is felt in the throat, and is precipitated by swallowing or yawning. In occipital neuralgia the episodes of pain originate from the base of the skull. Headaches associated with migraine tend to be throbbing and last for hours at a time.

        "question": "Brown-Sequard's syndrome is characterized by",
        "exp": "Ans. a (Loss of temperature & pain on opposite side). (Ref. Harrison 18th/Ch. 377)BROWN-SEQUARD HEMICORD SYNDROME consists of -# Ipsilateral weakness (corticospinal tract) and# Loss of joint position and vibratory sense (posterior column), with# Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sense (spinothalamic tract) one or two levels below the lesion. Brown-Sequard Hemlcord SyndromeThis consists of ipsilateral weakness (corticospinal tract) and loss of joint position and vibratory sense (posterior column), with contralateral loss of pain and temperature sense (spinothalamic tract) one or two levels below the lesion. Segmental signs, such as radicular pain, muscle atrophy, or loss of a deep tendon reflex, are unilateral. Partial forms are more common than the fully developed syndrome.Central Cord SyndromeThis syndrome results from selective damage to the grey matter nerve cells and crossing spinothalamic tracts surrounding the central canal. In the cervical cord, the central cord syndrome produces arm weakness out of proportion to leg weakness and a \"dissociated\" sensory loss, meaning loss of pain and temperature sensations over the shoulders, lower neck, and upper trunk (cape distribution), in contrast to preservation of light touch, joint position, and vibration sense in these regions. Spinal trauma, syringomyelia, and intrinsic cord tumors are the main causes.Anterior Spinal Artery SyndromeInfarction of the cord is generally the result of occlusion or diminished flow in this artery. The result is extensive bilateral tissue destruction that spares the posterior columns. All spinal cord functions motor, sensory, and autonomic are lost below the level of the lesion, with the striking exception of retained vibration and position sensation.Foramen Magnum SyndromeLesions in this area interrupt decussating pyramidal tract fibers destined for the legs, which cross caudal to those of the arms, resulting in weakness of the legs (crural paresis). Compressive lesions near the foramen magnum may produce weakness of the ipsilateral shoulder and arm followed by weakness of the ipsilateral leg, then the contralateral leg, and finally the contralateral arm, an \"around-the-clock\" pattern that may begin in any of the four limbs. There is typically suboccipital pain spreading to the neck and shoulders.Intramedullary and Extramedullary SyndromesIt is useful to differentiate intramedullary processes, arising within the substance of the cord, from extramedullary ones that compress the spinal cord or its vascular supply. The differentiating features are only relative and serve as clinical guides. With extramedullary lesions, radicular pain is often prominent, and there is early sacral sensory loss (lateral spinothalamic tract) and spastic weakness in the legs (corticospinal tract) due to the superficial location of leg fibers in the corticospinal tract. Intramedullary lesions tend to produce poorly localized burning pain rather than radicular pain and to spare sensation in the perineal and sacral areas (\"sacral sparing\"), reflecting the laminated configuration of the spinothalamic tract with sacral fibers outermost; corticospinal tract signs appear later. Regarding extramedullary lesions, a further distinction is made between extradural and intradural masses, as the former are generally malignant and the latter benign (neurofibroma being a common cause). Consequently, a long duration of symptoms favors an intradural origin.",

        "exp": "Ans. D. All of the above. (Ref. H - 17th / pg. 2584; Greenberg Handbook of Neuro-Surgery /pg. 844)Bilateral facial palsy is caused by:# Leprosy, Gullain Barrie Syndrome, Sarcoidosis.Causes of facial palsy:# Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi) can cause unilateral or bilateral facial palsies.# The Ramsay Hunt syndrome (reactivation of herpes zoster in the geniculate ganglion), consists of a severe facial palsy associated with a vesicular eruption in the external auditory canal and in the pharynx and other parts of the cranial integument; often the eighth cranial nerve is affected as well.# Facial palsy that is often bilateral occurs in sarcoidosis and in Guillain-Barrie syndrome.# Leprosy frequently involves the facial nerve, and facial neuropathy may also occur in diabetes mellitus, connective tissue diseases including Sjogren's syndrome, and amyloidosis.# The rare Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome consists of recurrent facial paralysis; recurrent and eventually permanent facial (particularly labial) edema; and, less constantly, plication of the tongue.# Acoustic neuromas frequently involve the facial nerve by local compression (Infarcts, demyelinating lesions of multiple sclerosis, and tumors are the common pontine lesions).# Tumors that invade temporal bone (carotid body, cholesteatoma, dermoid) may cause facial palsy.# All these forms of nuclear or peripheral facial palsy must be distinguished from the supranuclear type. In the latter, the frontalis and orbicularis oculi muscles are involved less than those of the lower part of the face, since the upper facial muscles are innervated by corticobulbar pathways from both motor cortices, whereas the lower facial muscles are innervated only by the opposite hemisphere.Additional Educational points:Bell's palsy:# The most common form of facial paralysis is Bell's palsy. Q# The onset of Bell's palsy is fairly abrupt, maximal weakness being attained by 48 h as a general rule. Pain behind the ear may precede the paralysis for a day or two. Taste sensation may be lost unilaterally, and hyperacusis may be present. In some cases there is mild cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis.# MRI may reveal swelling and uniform enhancement of the geniculate ganglion and facial nerve and, in some cases, entrapment of the swollen nerve in the temporal bone.# Approximately 80% of patients recover within a few weeks or months.2# Electromyography may be of some prognostic value; evidence of denervation after 10 days indicates there has been axonal degeneration, that there will be a long delay (3 months as a rule) before regeneration occurs, and that it may be incomplete.# The presence of incomplete paralysis in the first week is the most favorable prognostic sign. Bell's palsy is associated with the presence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 DNA in endoneurial fluid and posterior auricular muscle, suggesting that a reactivation of this virus in the geniculate ganglion may be responsible.However, a causal role for HSV in Bell's palsy is unproven.# An increased incidence of Bell's palsy was also reported among recipients of inactivated intranasal influenza vaccine, and it was hypothesized that this could have resulted from the Escherichia coli enterotoxin used as adjuvant or to reactivation of latent virus.# BELL'S PALSY: RX- Symptomatic measures include:* (1) the use of paper tape to depress the upper eyelid during sleep and prevent corneal drying, and* (2) massage of the weakened muscles.- A course of glucocorticoids, given as prednisone 60-80 mg daily during the first 5 days and then tapered over the next 5 days, appears to shorten the recovery period and modestly improve the functional outcome. A recently published randomized trial found no added benefit of acyclovir (400 mg five times daily for 10 days) compared to prednisolone alone for Rx of acute Bell's palsy; the value of valacyclovir (usual dose 1000 mg daily for 5-7 days) either alone or in combination with glucocorticoids is not known.",

Physical examination, including careful cranial nerve and deep tendon reflex testing, is otherwise normal. Which of the following is the best next step in evaluation?",
        "exp": "An excruciating headache with syncope requires evaluation for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This occurs with leakage or rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, usually located at an arterial bifurcation in the anterior cerebral circulation. Rupture may occur spontaneously or at times of exercise. About 2% of persons have \"berry\" aneurysms. Fortunately only a small percentage of these persons ever experience rupture, which may be fatal. The headache that precedes or accompanies SAH is severe and often described as a \"thunderclap\" headache, meaning that it reaches its maximum intensity in seconds. Migraine may also cause severe headache, but usually reaches maximum intensity in 5 to 30 minutes. Syncope occurs in about one-half of patients with SAH and is thought to be due to accompanying cerebral artery spasm Blood in the cerebrospinal fluid irritates the meninges and may cause neck stiffness. Suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage mandates CT scanning as the initial test. In about 90% of patients, there will be enough blood to be visualized on a non contrast CT scan. A contrast CT scan sometimes obscures the diagnosis because, in an enhanced scan, normal arteries may be mistaken for subarachnoid blood. If the CT scan is normal, a lumbar puncture will establish the diagnosis by demonstrating blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As opposed to CSF blood from a traumatic lumbar puncture, the CSF blood does not clear with continued collection of fluid. Cerebral angiography is necessary to assess the need for surgery and to detect other aneurysms, but it is usually delayed because angiography may precipitate spasm, especially if performed immediately after the acute rupture. Holter monitor might be helpful in unexplained syncope but would not address the severe headache. Electroencephalography is sometimes used to diagnose seizures in a patient with unwitnessed and unexplained syncope but would not be appropriate until subarachnoid hemorrhage has been excluded.",

Starting riluzole to slow the progression of ALS would, therefore, be inappropriate at this point. Disease in the cortex would never cause this combination of bilateral upper and lower neuron disease, so an MRI scan of the brain would be superfluous. Myopathies such as polymyositis or metabolic myopathy cause more proximal than distal weakness and would not be associated with hyperreflexia. You should think of disease of the neuromuscular junction (e.g., myasthenia gravis) or muscle when the neurological examination is normal except for weakness.

Lightly touching these zones often triggers an attach leading patients to protect these areas.# Other triggers of TN paroxysms include chewing, talking, brushing teeth, cold air smiling, and/or grimacing.o Autonomic symptoms, usually mild or moderate, can occur in association with attacks ofTNin the VI trigeminal distribution, including lacrimation, conjunctival injection, and rhinorrhea.Diagnosiso The diagnosis of TN is based upon the characteristic clinical features described above, primarily paroxysms of pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve.o Once the diagnosis of TN is suspected on clinical grounds, a search for secondary causes should be undertaken.Diagnostic criteria for trigerm in at neuralgiao The International Classification ofHeadache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria for classic TN are as follows:A)At least three attacks of unilateral facial pain fulfilling criteria B and CA) Occurring in one or more divisions of the trigeminal ner\\>e, with no radiation beyond the trigeminal distributionA) Pain has at least three of the following four characteristics:# Recurring in paroxysmal attacks lasting from a fraction of a second to two minutes.# Severe intensity.# Electric shock-like, shooting, stabbing, or sharp in quality.# At least three attacks precipitated by innocuous stimuli to the affected side of the face (some attacks may be, or appear to be, spontaneous).D) No clinically evident neurologic deficit.E) Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.",

But Alzheimer disease is caused by involvement of large vessels, while subcortical dementia like progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) involves small vessels.\"''The term \"small vessel\" is used for small penetrating branches that arise at acute angles from the large arteries of circle of Willis, stem of the middle cerebral artery and the basilar artery. These arteries penetrate at right angles to supply the deeper structures within the brain e.g. basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, pons. These arteries are prone to thrombosis and are common causes of ischemic stroke.\"With normal aging, there is also an accumulation of amyloid in cerebral blood vessels, leading to a condition called cerebral amyloid angiopathy (without dementia), which predisposes older persons to lobarhemorrhage and brain micro- hemorrhages (Small vessel disease). AD patients appear to be at increased risk for amyloid angiopathy, and this may explain some of the observed association between AD and stroke.\"\"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), although usually asymptomatic, is an important cause of primary lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in the elderly. It can occur as a sporadic disorder, sometimes in association with AD, or as a certain familial syndrome.

The blind spot, or scotoma, that may develop as part of the aura of a classic migraine attack will involve the same visual field in both eyes. This defect usually changes over the course of minutes. It typically enlarges and may intrude on the central vision. The margin of the blind spot is often scintillating or dazzling. If this margin has a pattern like the battlement of a castle, it is called a fortification spectrum, or teichopsia. Homonymous hemianoptic defects of the sort that develop during the aura of a classic migraine indicate an irritative lesion that is affecting one part of the occipital cortex in one hemisphere of the brain. The changes in the scotoma over the course of minutes indicate that the irritative phenomenon sets off a cascade of events in the visual cortex that temporarily disturbs vision in a progressively larger area. Other focal neurologic phenomena may precede classic migraine; the most common are tingling of the face or hand, mild confusion, transient hemiparesis, and ataxia. Fatigue, irritability, and easy distractibility often develop before a migraine. Affected persons usually also have hypersensitivity to light and noise during an attack.",

The larvae then migrate to the brain.* The parasites eventually die in the CNS, but not before initiating pathologic consequences that, in heavy infections, can result in permanent neurologic sequelae or death.* Migrating larvae cause marked local eosinophilic inflammation and hemorrhage, with sub- sequent necrosis and granuloma formation around dying worms.Clinical features & management* Clinical symptoms develop 2-35 days after the ingestion of larvae.* Patients usually present with an insidious or abrupt excruciating frontal, occipital, or bitemporal headache. Neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting, and paresthesias are also common. Fever, cranial and extraocular nerve palsies, seizures, paralysis, and lethargy are uncommon.* Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is mandatory in suspected cases and usually reveals an elevated opening pressure, a white blood cell count of 150-2000/mL, and an eosinophilic pleocytosis of >20* The diagnosis is generally based on the clinical presentation of eosinophilic meningitis together with a compatible epidemiologic history.* Specific chemotherapy is not of benefit in angiostrongyliasis; larvicidal agents may exacerbate inflammatory brain lesions.* Management consists of supportive measures, including the administration of analgesics, sedatives, and--in severe cases-- glucocorticoids.* Repeated lumbar punctures with removal of CSF can relieve symptoms.* In most patients, cerebral angiostrongyliasis has a self-limited course, and recovery is complete.* The infection may be prevented by adequately cooking snails, crabs, and prawns and inspecting vegetables for mollusk infestation.Note:* Other parasitic or fungal causes of eosinophilic meningitis in endemic areas may include.# Gnathostomiasis# Paragonimiasis# Schistosomiasis# Neurocysticercosis# Coccidioidomycosis",

She develops urinary urgency and frequency and is treated with oxycodone and ciprofloxacin. Three days later she develops a headache, dizziness, vomiting, and has difficulty walking. On neurological examination her strength, sensation (including vibratory sensation), and reflexes are normal. She walks with an uncoordinated, unsteady gait. On testing of coordination in the upper extremities, she displays past pointing and poor rapid alternating movements with her right upper extremity. In the lower extremities, her heel-shin testing also reveals poor coordination on the right. INR is 6.5 (normal <1, therapeutic for warfarin 2.0-3.0).

Many drugs (including ciprofloxacin) interact with warfarin, excessively prolong anticoagulation, and may result in spontaneous hemorrhage. Cerebellar lesions are typically associated with ataxia and dizziness. This patient's bleeding can be localized to the right cerebellar hemisphere since a focal lesion in one lobe of the cerebellum (e.g., a cerebellar tumor, hemorrhage or infarct) causes dyscoordination on the same side of the body (ipsilateral) as the lesion. Infarcts in the basal ganglia would cause extrapyramidal signs with rigidity and uncontrolled movements in addition to discoordination. Midline cerebellar lesions (most commonly alcoholic cerebellar degeneration) cause midline signs (especially gait ataxia) out of proportion to the findings in the extremities. Posterior column disease would cause sensory abnormalities (especially, loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation) rather than problems with coordination.

The infarct has damaged the left sixth and seventh cranial nerves or nuclei in the left pons with resultant diplopia on left lateral gaze and left facial weakness. Also damaged is the left descending corticospinal tract, proximal to its decussation in the medulla; this damage causes weakness in the right arm and leg.

Initially the use of triptans two or three times a month would provide complete relief. Over the past several years, however, the headaches have become more frequent and severe. Triptans provide only partial relief; the patient requires a combination of acetaminophen, caffeine, and butalbital to achieve some improvement. Prophylactic medications including beta-blockers, tricyclics, and topiramate have been unsuccessful in preventing the headaches, and she has been to the emergency room three times over the past 2 weeks for a \"pain shot.\" The general physical examination is unremarkable.

Any analgesic, including triptans themselves, can contribute, but opiates and barbiturates are the main culprits. In this setting, the migraine may \"transform\" into a chronic daily headache. Medication overuse headaches usually start in the morning and improve but do not completely resolve with analgesic therapy. The patient must completely discontinue the offending drug for 2 to 12 weeks for the headaches to resolve. Treating headaches during the period of abstinence can be very difficult. The physician should be vigilant about the development of another cause of headache (mass lesion, inflammatory disorder) in a patient with transformed migraines. CNS imaging and laboratory workup, not generally recommended in the patient with typical migraine, are sometimes indicated. In this patient without focal neurological findings, however, the most likely diagnosis is still medication overuse headache.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Increased intracranial tensionWe are not sure of the answer.We have gone for increased intracranial tension because spontaneous C.S.F. leak is associated with intracranial hypotension.Increased intracranial tension is not associated with spontaneous C.S.F. leak.All other options mentioned in the question are associated with spontaneous C.S.F. leak.Pseudotumor CerebriPseudotumor cerebri usually presents with triad of headache, papilledema and minimal or absent focal neurological signs, but rarely the presenting feature may be a nasal C.S.F. leak.Empty sella syndromeIn empty sella syndrome, the sella turcica (the bony structure which contains pituitary enlarges). In this disease there is a defect in tissue barrier that normally keeps the cerebrospinal fluid around the brain separate from the sella turcica. As a result cerebrospinal fluid puts increased pressure on the pituitary glands and the walls of the sella turcica. The sella tunica enlarges and the pituitary shrinks.The empty sella syndrome may produce no symptoms at all and seldom produces serious symptom. About half of those affected have headaches. In rare cases there is leaking of the cerebrospinal fluid from the nose.EncephaloceleEncephalocele may present with C.S.F. leak.More on spontaneous C.S.F. leak or spontaneous intracranial hypotensionSpontaneous intracranial hypotension is a condition where patient gets postural headache due to leak of the cerebrospinal fluid in the spinal membrane.What happens is that the leak causes low C.S.F. pressure within the nervous system and thus causes a string of headache to the patient.The problem with SIH is that it is hard to diagnose and there is not a great deal of information on why it occurs.It has been associated with connective tissue diseases which may involve the dura causing tear in it.To summarize it, spontaneous C.S.F. leak is very rare and unlike other causes it does not occur due to any specific traumatic event or surgical procedure in the nervous system.Although there is not much information on the possible causes of C.S.F. leak, it is suspected that an intrinsic weakness of the spinal membrane or an abnormality of the brain structure causes the rare condition. The symptoms of SIH are so small and so common that it can often be misdiagnosed.",
