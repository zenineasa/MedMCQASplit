        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Richter syndrome o Richter's transformation (RT, Richter's syndrome) was first described in 1928 by Maurice Richter as the development of an aggressive large-cell lymphoma in the setting of underlying chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). Although diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common histology seen in patients with RT, Hodgkin lymphoma and T cell lymphomas have also been reported less commonly. The clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of RT will be discussed here.Clinical presentationo Richter's transformation (RT) should be suspected in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who develop rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy or extranodal sites of disease, systemic symptoms, or elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase.Diagnosiso Biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis, and usually shows a histologic pattern consistent with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).o Occasional patients may have a histologic picture consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma.Treatmento The prognosis and outcome are historically poor for RT and the disease is invariably fatal if left untreated.o For patients with the DLBCL histologic pattern of RT, the use of combination chemotherapy as employed for aggressive lymphoma, combined with rituximab is recommended (eg, CHOP-R).o Since complete remissions after chemotherapy are short-lived, and long-term survivors have been reported following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), the use of either nonmyeloablative allogeneic or autologous HCT when first remission has been achieved in patients who are transplant candidates.o Autologous HCT may be preferred in older patients or those with chemotherapy sensitive disease.o For patients with the Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) the use of combination chemotherapy regimens employed in patients with advanced stage HL is suggested (eg, ABVD)o Given the limited data on treatment outcomes for RT, all patients with RT are best advised to enroll in an appropriately designed clinical trial.",

This is true for several reasons.CLL is a disease of the older populationMay be diagnosed in an asymptomatic patientProlonged courseNot curable with current treatment approachesSurvival advantage was not demonstrated with early intervention clinical trials.Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has not been a viable option in CLL in the past because of the prohibitive toxicity of this approach in a population of older patients.Multiple drug therapy (Fludarabine and Chlorambucil) is preferred in elderly patients.Indications to initiate treatment for CLLConstitutional symptoms attributable to CLL:weight loss (greater than 10% of baseline weight within the preceding 6 months)extreme fatigue, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or greaterfever (temperature greater than 38??C or 100.5??F for at least 2 weeks)night sweats without evidence of infection:Evidence of progressive bone marrow failure characterized by the development or worsening of anemia or thrombocytopenia, or bothAIHA or autoimmune thrombocytopenia, or both, poorly responsive to corticosteroid therapy:Massive (greater than 6 cm below the left costal margin) or progressive splenomegaly:Massive (greater than 10 cm in longest diameter) or progressive lymphadenopathyProgressive lymphocytosis defined as an increase in the absolute lymphocyte count by greater than 50% over a 2-month period, or a doubling time predicted to be less than 6 months.LeukemiaTreatmentAMLCytarabine + Anthracycline +/- EtoposideCMLImatinib mesylate (DOC), Hydroxyurea, Interferon-yALLInduction: Vincristine, prednisone.

Alternatively, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or both may be detected during a regular physical examination. When symptomatic, the most frequent complaint is fatigue or a vague sense of being unwell. Less frequently, enlarged nodes or the development of an infection is the initial complaint, and the most frequent infections are bacterial pneumonias. In contrast to lymphomas, fever and weight loss are uncommon.Peripheral BloodThe diagnosis is now made with a count of greater than 5 x 10 VIPresence of typical immunophenotypic markers.The median lymphocyte count at diagnosis is 30 x lOVL.In most patients, the leukemia cells have the morphologic appearance of normal small to medium-sized lymphocytes with clumped chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and a small ring of cytoplasm.
