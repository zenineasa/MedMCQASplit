These personalities are usually different, at times even opposing. Each personality has a full range of higher mental functions and performs complex behaviour patterns. Usually, one personality is not aware of the existence of the other(s), i.e. there are amnesic barriers between the personalities. Both the onset and termination of control of the each personality is sudden. Classical examples in the published literature include 'Three Faces of Eve' and 'Sybil'. Trance and Possession Disorders Trance and possession disorders ( possession hysteria) are characterised by the control of person's personality by a 'spirit', during the episodes. Usually, the person is aware of the existence of the other (i.e. 'possessor'), unlike in multiple personalities. Ref: A Sho Textbook of Psychiatry, Niraj Ahuja, 7th Edition, pg. no. 102",

Dissociative Motor Disorders: The motor disturbance usually involves either paralysis or abnormal movements. The 'paralysis' may be a monoplegia, paraplegia or quadriplegia. The abnormal movements can range from tremors, choreiform movements and gait disturbances, to convulsive movements. These movements either occur or increase when attention is directed towards them and may disappear when the patient is watched unobserved. These movements do not fit the 'typical' clinical picture of the abnormal involuntary movement disorders. The gait disturbance (ataxia abasia) is usually characterised by a wide-based, jerky, staggering, dramatic and irregular gait with exaggerated body movements.

The emphasis in hypochondriasis is on the diagnosis whereas the emphasis in somatization disorder is on the symptoms.
