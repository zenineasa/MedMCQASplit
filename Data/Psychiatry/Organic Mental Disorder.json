Stored in Entorhinal cortex & Thalamus (mammillary body ).Semantic memory denotes general information and knowledge (time- independent. like how many continents on the earth?). Stored in medial temporal lobes. May get affected alone as in herpes simplex infection (leaving episodic memory intact!)5.

Simple vocalizations might include repetitive throat-clearing, sniffing, or grunting sounds. Complex motor tics might include facial grimacing combined with a head twist and a shoulder shrug. Other complex motor tics include sniffing or touching objects, hopping, jumping, bending, or twisting. More complex vocal tics include words or phrases. Perhaps the most dramatic and disabling tics include motor movements that result in self-harm such as punching oneself in the face or vocal tics including coprolalia (uttering socially inappropriate words such as swearing) or echolalia (repeating the words or phrases of others).o Majority of people with TS require no medication for tic suppression.
