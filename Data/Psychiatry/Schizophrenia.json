        "question": "Which of the following hypothesis was initially given for etiology of schizophrenia?",
        "exp": "Ans. B. Dopamine hypothesisThe dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia or the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis is a model attributing symptoms of schizophrenia (like psychoses) to a disturbed and hyperactive dopaminergic signal transduction. The model draws evidence from the observation that a large number of antipsychotics have dopamine-receptor antagonistic effects. The theory, however, does not posit dopamine overabundance as a complete explanation for schizophrenia. Rather, the over activation of D2 receptors, specifically, is one effect of the global chemical synaptic dysregulation observed in this disorder.Some researchers have suggested that dopamine systems in the mesolimbic pathway may contribute to the 'positive symptoms' of schizophrenia (whereas problems with dopamine function in themes cortical pathway may be responsible for the 'negative symptoms', such as avolition and alogia.) Abnormal expression, thus distribution of the D2 receptor between these areas and the rest of the brain may also be implicated in schizophrenia, specifically in the acute phase. A relative excess of these receptors within the limbic system means Broca's area which can produce illogical language, has an abnormal connection to Wernicke's area, which comprehends language, but does not create it. Note that variation in distribution is observed within individuals, so abnormalities of this characteristic likely play a significant role in all psychological illnesses. Individual alterations are produced by differences within glutamatergic pathways within the limbic system, which are also implicated in other psychotic syndromes. Among the alterations of both synaptic and global structure, the most significant abnormalities are observed in the uncinate fasciculus and the cingulate cortex. The combination these creates a profound dissymmetry of prefrontal inhibitory signaling, shifted positively towards the dominant side. Eventually, the cingulate gyrus becomes atrophied towards the anterior, due to long-Term Depression (LTD) and Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) from the abnormally strong signals transversely across the brain. This, combined with a relative deficit in GABAergic input to Wernicke's area, shifts the balance of bilateral communication across the corpus callosum posteriorly.",

These are actual hallucinations, but the source can be identified by the patient as his or her own thoughts.Hallucinations of more than one voice talking to each other; conference type auditory hallucinations. Subject can be of anything.Hallucinations of a voice or voices that continuously comment on the patient's behavior simultaneously with the action; running commentary type of auditory hallucinations.B. Thought alienation phenomenaThought insertionThought withdrawalThought diffusion or thought broadcastingThought insertion is a feeling that other people are intruding their thoughts on the patient.Thought withdrawal is a feeling that other people are taking the thoughts away.Thoughts are believed to be no longer private but shared (or perceived) by others.C.

The atypical antipsychotics are more commonly used nowadays.Clozapine is the drug used in treatment of refractory cases. It may cause agranulocytosis in up to 2% of patients; dose-related lowering of seizure threshold has also been seen.Fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate are suitable for long-term parenteral maintenance therapy in patients who cannot or will not take oral medication and for use in non compliant patients.Good prognostic factorsPoor prognostic factors1.

        "exp": "Ans. B. Paranoid schizophrenia. (Ref: Kaplan & Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry, Xth/Ch. 13, Pg. 476).A 28-year-old female presents with complain of reduced sleep with disorganized behavior since 9 months. She feels there is a camera fixed behind her head, which always follows her. The most likely diagnosis would be Paranoid schizophrenia.Discussion:Depending on the predominance of particular symptoms, four subtypes of schizophrenia are recognized: paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, and residual.The female in the question presents with the classic symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. This subtype of schizophrenia is characterized by prominent hallucinations and delusional ideations with a relative preservation of affect and cognitive functions. Delusions are usually grandiose or persecutory or both, organized around a central coherent theme. Hallucinations, usually auditory, are frequent and related to the delusional theme. Anxiety, anger, argumentativeness, and aloofness are often present. Paranoid schizophrenia tends to develop later in life and is associated with a better prognosis.Kaplan, pg. 546......Patient with a major depression with psychotic features should have symptoms over two weeks (the minimum for the diagnosis), and symptoms include anhedonia, crying, anergia, decreased concentration, weight loss, and insomnia with early morning awakening. Patient also may have somatic delusions that are mood congruent and an auditory hallucination. The presence of psychotic phenomena that follow a clear mood disorder picture makes the diagnosis of major depression with psychotic features the most likely.Kaplan, pg. 512-520........The main feature of delusional disorder is the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions without deterioration of psychosocial functioning and in the absence of bizarre or odd behavior. Auditory and visual hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delusional theme. Tactile and olfactory hallucinations may also be present if they are incorporated in the delusional system (such as feeling insects crawling over the skin in delusions of infestation). Subtypes of delusional disorder include erotomanic, gran- diose, jealous, persecutory, and somatic (delusions of being infested with parasites, of emitting a bad odor, of having AIDS). Delusional disorder usually manifests in middle or late adult life and has a fluctuating course with periods of remissions and relapses.Additional Educational points:# Amphetamine intoxication can result in a psychosis very closely resembling acute paranoid schizophrenia, with symptoms including paranoid delusions and visual hallucinations.# Persons with a paranoid personality disorder characteristically show marked suspiciousness of others and are extremely sensitive to any potential threat or injustice. They frequently look for hidden motives or meanings, are contemptuous of the weak, and are very sensitive to issues of power and dominance. They often are moralistic or self- righteous and may be quite litigious. The percentage of affected persons who go on to develop schizophrenia is not known, but schizophrenia or paranoid psychosis is not the typical outcome.",
