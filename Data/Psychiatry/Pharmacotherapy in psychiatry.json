Risperidone is not as effective as clozapine in treatment-resistant cases but does not carry a risk of blood dyscrasias.# Olanzapine is similar neurochemically to clozapine but has a significant risk of inducing weight gain.# Quetiapine is distinct in having a weak D2 effect but potent alpha-1 and histamine blockade.# Ziprasidone causes minimal weight gain and is unlikely to increase prolactin, but may increase QT prolongation.# Aripiprazole also has little risk of weight gain or prolactin increase but may increase anxiety, nausea, and insomnia as a result of its partial agonist properties.Extrapyramidal side effectsEarly onset and reversibleDystoniaInvoluntary contraction primarily of the face, neck, tongue and extraocular musclesResponds to anticholinergicsParkinsonAkinesia, muscle rigidity, tremor, shuffling gait (typically appearing in that order)AkathisiaMotor restlessness and the urge to moveLate onset and IrreversibleTardive dyskinesis (TD)# Diagnosis requires exposure to neuroleptics for at least 3 months, but often take longer # Involuntary repetitive movements of lips, face, tongue, limbs# Try to prevent by using lowest possible dose of antipsychotic medication# Anticholinergics worsen TD# Try to reduce dose or discontinue medication if TD occurs (although increasing dose will temporarily mask symptoms)# Switch to an atypical antipsychoticAtypical AntipsychoticsDrugsCharacteristicsSide effectsClozapineRisperidoneOlanzapineQuetipineZiprasidineAripiprazole# Generally good 5HT2 antagonists and weaker D2 antagonists# Treats positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (typicals treat mostly positive)# Less EPS# Tend to be more expensive than typicals# Clozapine: agranulocytosis# Ziprasidone: prolongs QT interval, may lead to torsadede pointes# Risperidone: some EPSEducational points:Tardive dyskinesia# Occurs primarily due to chronic exposure to central dopamine blockers.# Rx:- Approximately one-third of patients with TD remit within 3 months of stopping neuroleptic therapy, and in most patients the movements will gradually remit within 5 years.- Abrupt drug cessation may result in \"withdrawal dyskinesias,\" i.e. frank TD.- In refractory cases, choreatic TD catecholamine depletors reserpine and tetrabenazine are useful.- Another strategy employ is GABAergic medications such as baclofen (40 to 80 mg/d), clonazepam (1 to 8 mg/d), or valproic acid (750 to 3,000 mg/d), which are particularly helpful in patients with tardive dystonia, which may also benefit from anticholinergic therapy and botulinum toxin injections.",

It is unclear whether these reports represent true side effects of the atypicals or coincidental exacerbations of the patient's underlying condition.Anxiety, insomnia, headache & nausea.Weight gain and the metabolic syndrome - low to medium risk.About other options:Clozapine: almost no effectsOlanzapine, ziprasidone: limited effectsThe hyperprolactinemia from antipsychotic drugs is rapidly reversible when the drugs are discontinued.DRUGS CAUSING HYPERPROLACTINEMIAMedication ClassFrequency of Prolactin ElevationMechanismAntipsychotics*.

Most treatment algorithms begin treatment of each of these disorders with an SSRI.Serotonin-Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine has been shown in randomized, controlled trials to be as effective as SSRIs in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and generalized social anxiety disorder.Beta blockers like propranalol and atenolol are particularly useful in management of anticipatory anxiety (anxiety occurring before going on stage, or before examinations)Buspirone is an anti anxiety drug which does not have any dependence potential, unlike benzodiazepines.Note on anxiety disordersAnxiety is the commonest psychiatric symptom in clinical practice and anxiety disorders are one of the commonest psychiatric disorders in general population.1) Generalised anxiety disorder: This is characterized by an insidious onset in the third decade and a stable, usually chronic course which may or may not be punctuated by panic attacks.The symptoms of anxiety should last tor at least a period of 6 months for a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder to be made. It is the commonest psychiatric disorder in the population.2) Panic disorder: This is characterized by discrete episodes of acute anxiety. Panic disorder can either present alone or with agoraphobia.Note on phobiasPhobia is defined as an irrational fear of a specific object. situation or activity, often leading to persistant avoidance of the feared object situation or activity, often leading to persistant avoidance of the feared object situation or activity.The common type of phobias are:a) Agoraphobia-It is the commonest type of phobia encountered in clinical practice.lt is characterized by an irrational fear of being in places away from the familiar setting of home. It includes fear of open spaces.public spaces, crowded spaces and any other place from where there is no easy escape to a safe place.A full blown attack may occur (agoraphobia with panic disorder) or only a few symptoms(like dizziness or tachycardia) may occur (agoraphobia without panic disorder)SSRIs are currently the drugs of choice .with paroxetine being the most widely used drug. \"Nomophobia\"-one of the latest additions to the phobia list.

Refinements of magnetic stimulators, including the development of stimulators capable of discharging at frequencies up to 60Hz (referred to as rapid-rate TMS ) have allowed focal stimulation of the CNS to estimate motor thresholds and determine hemispheric language dominance.rTMS was found to benefit some patients with Parkinson's disease, and some patients with Parkinson's disease exhibited improved mood after rTMS. Additionally, subjects exposed to rTMS for purposes of determining hemispheric language dominance exhibited affective responses after stimulation of the left frontal cortex.These observations suggest that rTMS may have therapeutic potential in psychiatry and may allow focal stimulation of areas most involved in affective states. In one of the best studies to date, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation significantly improved depression ratings in 11 of 17 patients with psychotic major depression.rTMS appears to be well tolerated and does not require general anesthesia. Seizures may be a side effect in some patients but do not appear to be required for therapeutic effects. TMS is performed using a high-speed magnetic stimulator that generates a 1.5- to 2.5-Tesla field for brief periods. This field is similar to that used for nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. rTMS stimulus is delivered at frequencies of 10to60Hz using a figure 8-shaped coil that is placed over the desired region of the skull and cooled continuously with water to prevent overheating. Patients and staff usually wear earplugs because of the noise generated by the stimulator. Stimulation is typically given several times per session and is repeated over several days to weeks.",

NRTs are meant to be used for a short period of time and should be tapered down to a low dose before stopping. NRTs increase the chance of stopping smoking by 50to60% compared to placebo or to no treatment. There is no side effects reported other than local slight irritation and rarely non-ischemic chest pain.Antidepressants: The antidepressant bupropion is considered a first-line medication for smoking cessation and has been shown in many studies to increase long-term success rates. People who take bupropion should be monitored for any unusual mood changes; bupropion also increases risk of seizures and should not be used in people with a seizure disorder. Varenicline decreases the urge to smoke and reduces withdrawal symptoms and is therefore considered a first-line medication for smoking cessation. A 2016 Cochrane review of 27 studies also found that the number of people stopping smoking with varenicline was higher than with bupropion or NRT.

The skin is stretched laterally from the intended site of injection and then insert the needle at 90deg angle. After 10 seconds of injecting the drug, skin is released to allow the displaced tissue to cover the needle track. It is done to maximize absorption in to muscles by preventing the drug from moving back to subcutaneous tissue.Z track technique is also used to inject iron.",
