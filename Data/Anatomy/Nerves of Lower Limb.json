        "question": "A 67-year-old patient has been given a course of antibiotics by gluteal intramuscular injections after a major abdominal surgery.To avoid damaging the sciatic nerve during an injection, the needle should be inseed into which of the following areas?",
        "exp": "To avoid damaging the sciatic nerve during an intramuscular injection, the clinician should inse the needle in the upper lateral quadrant of the gluteal region. The inseed needle in the lower medial quadrant may damage the pudendal and sciatic nerves. The inseed needle midway between the ischial tuberosity and the lesser trochanter may damage the sciatic and posterior femoral cutaneous nerves on the quadratus femoris. The inseed needle over the sacrospinous ligament may damage the pudendal nerve and vessels.",

        "question": "Radiographic examination of a woman with foot pain reveals Moon's neuroma. What is the most typical location of this neuroma?,",
        "exp": "Moon's neuroma most commonly involves compression (and possible enlargement) of an anastomosing branch that connects the medial and lateral plantar nerves between the third and fouh toes. The pain can be severe. The medial plantar nerve provides sensation for the medial three and a half toes; the lateral plantar nerve supplies the little toe and half of the fouh toe. The neural interconnection can be compressed between the transverse metatarsal ligament and the floor. Women are 10 times more likely than men to be afflicted with this problem, most likely due to wearing shoes that put excessive stress on the forefoot. In about 80% of cases the pain can be eased with different shoes or coisone injections. fig:-Moon's neuroma",

The flexor hallucis longus tendon occupies in a groove on the posterior surface of the body of the talus and a groove on the inferior surface of the calcaneus during its course.

The medial branch of the deep peroneal nerve supplies the skin of adjacent sides of the great and second toes, whereas the lateral branch supplies the extensor digitorum brevis and extensor hallucis brevis. The superficial peroneal nerve innervates the peroneus longus and brevis, which plantar flexes the foot, and supplies the skin on the side of the lower leg and the dorsum of the ankle and foot. The tibial nerve innervates the muscles of the posterior compament that plantar flexes and supplies the skin on the heel and plantar aspect of the foot.
