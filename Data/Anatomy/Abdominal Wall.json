        "exp": "Ans. C. Pelvic fasciaCondensations of endopelvic fascia-a. Although types of endopelvic fascia do not differ much in their gross appearance, some parts of the endopelvic fascia haveva much more fibrous consistency, containing an abundance of collagen and elastic fibers, and a scattering of smooth muscle fibers. These parts are often described as \"fascial condensations\" or pelvic \"ligaments.\"b. Hypo gastric sheath is a thick band of condensed pelvic fascia. This fascial condensation is not merelya barrier separating the two potential spaces namely the retropubic space and presacral space. It gives passage to essentially all the vessels and nerves passing from the lateral wall of the pelvis to the pelvic viscera, along with the ureters and, in the male, the ductus deferens.c. As it extends medially from the lateral wall, the hypogastric sheath divides into three laminae (layers) that pass to or between the pelvic organs, conveying neurovascular structures and providing support. Because of the latter function, they are also referred to as ligaments.d. The anterior most lamina, the lateral ligament of the bladder, passes to the bladder, conveying the superior vesical arteries and veins.e. The posterior most lamina (lateral rectal ligament) passes to the rectum, conveying the middle rectal artery and vein.f. In the male, the middle lamina forms a relatively thin fascial partition, the rectovesical septum, between the posterior surface of the bladder and the prostate anteriorly and the rectum posteriorly.g. In the female, the middle lamina is markedly more substantial than the other two, passing medially to the uterine cervix and vagina as the cardinal ligament (transverse cervical ligament).",

It originates at the level of L1/2 vertebral body and extends 5-7 cm in the caudocephalad axis.* Thoracic duct originates from the chyle cistern in the abdomen and ascends through the aortic hiatus in the diaphragm. Thoracic duct ascends in the posterior mediastinum among the thoracic aorta on its left, the azygos vein on its right, the esophagus anteriorly, and the vertebral bodies posteriorly. At the level of the T4, T5, or T6 vertebra, the thoracic duct crosses to the left, posterior to the esophagus, and ascends into the superior mediastinum.* NOTE: Although thoracic duct derives from cisterna chyli, it is the thoracic duct that passes through diaphragm and not the cisterna chyli.",

The inferior epigastric vessels lie posteriorly and medially to the deep inguinal ring.# The superior boundary is formed by the conjoined muscles (internal oblique and transversus) and the inferior boundary is the inguinal ligament.DEEP INGUINAL RING# It is an oval opening in fascia transversalis about half an inch above mid-inguinal point,# I It lies immediately lateral to inferior epigastric artery.# It transmits spermatic cord in male and round ligament in female.# Fascia transversalis is the inner surface of abdominal muscles lining.# Fascia separates peritoneum from extraperitoneal tissue.# An indirect hernia travels down the canal on the outer (lateral and anterior) side of the spermatic cord. A direct hernia comes out directly forwards through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal.# While the neck of the indirect hernia is lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels, the direct hernia usually emerges medial to this except in the saddle-bag or pantaloon type, which has both a lateral and a medial component.# An inguinal hernia can be differentiated from a femoral hernia by ascertaining the relation of the neck of the sac to the medial end of the inguinal ligament and the pubic tubercle,i.e.in the case of an inguinal hernia the neck is above and medial, while that of a femoral hernia is below and lateral.",
