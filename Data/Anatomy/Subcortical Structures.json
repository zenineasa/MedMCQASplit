        "exp": "Ans. D. Geniculate bodiesa. The diencephalon has four parts on each side: the thalamus, subthalamus, epithalamus, and hypothalamus.b. The thalamus, by far the largest component, is subdivided into nuclei that have different afferent and efferent connections. Certain thalamic nuclei receive input from the pathways for all the senses except smell; these nuclei project to corresponding sensory areas of the cerebral cortex. Other thalamic nuclei are connected with motor and association areas of the cortex, and yet others participate in memory, sleep, and mental activities.c. The subthalamus is a complex region ventral to the thalamus; it includes a nucleus with motor functions (the subthalamic nucleus) and tracts from the brain stem, cerebellum, and corpus striatum, which terminate in the thalamus.d. The epithalamus, situated dorso medially to the thalamus and adjacent to the roof of the third ventricle, consists of the anterior and posterior paraventricular nuclei, the medial and lateral habenular nuclei, the stria medullaris thalami, posterior commissure and the pineal body. They are concerned with autonomic and behavioral responses to emotional changes.e. The hypothalamus occupies the region between the third ventricle and the subthalamus; it is the part of the forebrain that integrates and controls the activities of the autonomic nervous system and of several endocrine glands. The neurohypophysis, which includes the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, is an outgrowth of the hypothalamus.",
