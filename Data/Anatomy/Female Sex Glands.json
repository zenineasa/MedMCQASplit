Therefore, this part is mesodermal in origin.ii) Lower l/3rd: It is derived from sinovaginal bulb which intum is derived from urogenital sinus. Thus, this part is endodermal in origin.",

The gonad develops a cortex and a medulla. Until the sixth week of development, these structures are identical in both sexes. In genetic males, the medulladevelops during the seventh and eighth weeks into a testis, and the cortex regresses. Leydig and Sertoli cells appear, and testosterone and miillerian inhibiting substance are secreted. In genetic females, the cortex develops into an ovary and the medulla regresses.",
