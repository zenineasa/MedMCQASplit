        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Ascending cervical artery o This question is not as simple as it looks. Anterior and posterior spinal arteries supply spinal cord, but not spinal nerve roots.o Spinal nerve roots are supplied by radicular arteries which are segmental branches of vertebral, ascending cervical, deep cervical, intercostal and sacral arteries.Blood supply of spinal cord1. The spinal cord receives its blood supply from three longitudinal arterial channels that extend along the length of the spinal corda) The anterior spinal artery is presemt in relation to the anterior median fissure.b) Two posterior spinal arteries ( one of each side) run along the posterolateral sulcus (i.e., along the line of attachment of the dorsal nerve roots.)c) In addition to these channels the pia mater covering the spinal cord has an arterial plexus (called the arterial vasocorona) which also sends branches into the substance of the cord.2. The main source of blood to the spinal cord is from the vertebral arteries (form which the anterior and posterior spinal arteries take origin)a) However, the blood from the vertebral artery reaches only up the cervical segments of the cord.b) Lower down the spinal cord receive blood through radicular arteries that reach the cord along the roots of spinal nerves. These radicular arteries arise form spinal branches of the vertebral, ascending cervical, deep cervical, intertcostal, lumbar and sacral arteriesc) Many of these radicular arteries are small and end by supplying the nerve roots.d) A few of them, which are larger, join the spinal arteries and contribute blood to them.",
