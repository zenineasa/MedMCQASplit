But, because of the action of a toxic agent, the tissue cells cannot make use of the O2 supplied to them.Effects of hypoxia on cellsHypoxia causes the production of transcription factors (hypoxia-inducible factors; HIFs).

The codons for most amino acids can be symbolized by The first two letters of each codon are the primary determinants of specificity Transfer RNAs base-pair with mRNA codons at a three-base sequence on the tRNA called the anticodon. The first base of the codon in mRNA (read in the 5'-3'direction) pairs with the third base of the anticodon If the anticodon triplet of a tRNA recognized only one codon triplet through Watson-Crick basepairing at all three positions, cells would have a different tRNA for each amino acid codon. This is not the case, however, because the anticodons in some tRNAs include the nucleotide inosinate (designated I), which contains the uncommon base hypoxanthine. Inosinate can form hydrogen bonds with three different nucleotides (U, C, and A), although these pairings are much weaker than the hydrogen bonds of Watson-Crick base pairs.

It curves around neck of fibula deep to peroneus longus and divides into superficial and deep peroneal nerves. The superficial peroneal nerve innervates peroneus longus and peroneus brevis which are the eveors of foot and to the skin over the dorsal area of foot except the first webspace and lateral side of little toe. The deep peroneal nerve innervates all muscles of anterior compa which are the dorsiflexors of foot, extensor digitorum brevis, first two dorsal interossei muscles and skin between great and second toes. Hence, injury to common peroneal nerve will lead to weakness of dorsiflexion of foot or foot drop, loss of eversion, loss of extension of toes and sensory loss along anterior and lateral side of leg, dorsum of foot including medial side of great toe.

Plasmids have several propeies that make them extremely useful as cloning vectors. They exist as single or multiple copies within the bacterium and replicate independently from the bacterial DNA. The precise location of restriction enzyme cleavage sites for inseing the foreign DNA is available. Plasmids are smaller than the host chromosome and are therefore easily separated from the latter, and the desired plasmid-inseed DNA is readily removed by cutting the plasmid with the enzyme specific for the restriction site into which the original piece of DNA was inseed. Phages usually have linear DNA molecules into which foreign DNA can be inseed at several restriction enzyme sites. The chimeric DNA is collected after the phage proceeds through its lytic cycle and produces mature, infective phage paicles. A major advantage of phage vectors is that while plasmids accept DNA pieces about 6-10 kb long, phages can accept DNA fragments 10-20 kb long, a limitation imposed by the amount of DNA that can be packed into the phage head. Larger fragments of DNA can be cloned in cosmids, which combine the best features of plasmids and phages. Cosmids are plasmids that contain the DNA sequences, so-called cos sites, required for packaging lambda DNA into the phage paicle. These vectors grow in the plasmid form in bacteria, but since much of the unnecessary lambda DNA has been removed, more chimeric DNA can be packaged into the paicle head. It is not unusual for cosmids to carry inses of chimeric DNA that are 35-50 kb long. Even larger pieces of DNA can be incorporated into bacterial aificial chromosome (BAC), yeast aificial chromosome (YAC), or E. coli bacteriophage P1-based (PAC) vectors.",

Therefore, the second stage of delivery should be cut sho by instrumentation.Supplementary analgesia for instrumentation with slow epidural boluses of fentanyl and a low concentration of bupivacaine reduces SVR and the cardiac pre-load.One of the major advantages of epidural analgesia is that it can be administered in incremental doses and that the total dose could be titrated to the desired sensory level.This coupled with the slower onset of anesthesia, allows the maternal cardiovascular system to compensate for the occurrence of sympathetic blockade, resulting in a lower risk of hypotension and decreased uteroplacental perfusion.Moreover, the segmental blockade spares the lower extremity \"muscle pump,\" aiding in venous return, and also decreases the incidence of thromboembolic events.Invasive hemodynamic monitoring, judicious intravenous administration of crystalloid and administration of small bolus doses of phenylephrine maintain maternal hemodynamic stability.(Ref: William's Obstetrics, 22nd edition, pg no: 483)",

A self-splicing group I intron may have more than 400 nucleotides. The hammerhead ribozyme consists of two RNA strands with only 41 nucleotides in all. As with protein enzymes, the three-dimensional structure of ribozymes is impoant for function. Ribozymes are inactivated by heating above their melting temperature or by addition of denaturing agents or complementary oligonucleotides, which disrupt normal base-pairing patterns. Ribozymes can also be inactivated if essential nucleotides are changed. Example: Hammerhead ribozyme: These segments are called hammerhead ribozymes because their secondary structures are shaped like the head of a hammer. The hammerhead ribozyme is a metalloenzyme; Mg+2 ions are required for activity. The phosphodiester bond at the site of self-cleavage is indicated by an arrow In Tetrahymena, the pre-rRNA molecule contains an intron that is removed by self-splicing (in the presence of guanosine, GMP, GDP or GTP) without the need for involvement of any protein. This was the first ribozyme discovered but many have since been repoed.",

The total number of primary oocytes at bih is estimated to vary from 700,000 to 2 million. During childhood most oocytes become atretic; only approximately 400,000 are present by the beginning of pubey, and fewer than 500 will be ovulated. Some oocytes that reach maturity late in life have been dormant in the diplotene stage of the first meiotic division for 40 years or more before ovulation. Whether the diplotene stage is the most suitable phase to protect the oocyte against environmental influences is unknown. The fact that the risk of having children with chromosomal abnormalities increases with maternal age indicates that primary oocytes are vulnerable to damage as they age.
