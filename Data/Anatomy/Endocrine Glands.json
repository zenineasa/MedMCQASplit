        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Rathke's pouch o Prolactin is secreted by anterior lobe of pituitary which develops from Rathke's pouch.Pituitary gland (Hypophysis cerebri)o Pituitary gland lies within hypophyseal/pituitary fossa or sella turcica of sphenoid bone which is roofed by diaphragm sellae. It is suspended from tuber cinereum of hypothalamus by infundibulum (pituitary stalk).o It is related anterosuperiorly to optic chiasma laterally to cavernous sinus and inferiorly to sphenoid air sinuses in the body of sphenoid.o Pituitary gland is oval in shape, measures 8 12 mm, and weighs about 500 mg.o Pituitary gland has two main subdivisions:- (i) Adenohypophysis (anterior lobe), and (ii) Neurohypophysis (posterior lobe).o Adenohypophysis (anterior lobe) include (i) pars anterior or pars distalis or pars glandularis or anterior lobe proper, (ii) pars intermedia (intermediate lobe); and (iii) tuberal lobe (pars tuberalis). It develops from an upward growth (Rathke's pouch) from the ectodermal roof of stomodeum.o Neurohypophysis (posterior lobe) include (i) pars posterior or pars nervosa or neural lobe or posterior lobe proper; (ii) infundibulum (infundibular stem); and (iii) median eminence. It develops from a downgrowth from the 3rd ventricle/diencephalon (neuroectoderm) called infundibulum.o Anterior lobe contains many hormone secreting cells: chromophils (acidophils, basophils), chromophobes and follicullostellate cells. Posterior pituitary contain neuroglia like pituicytes which do not secrete any hormone. The posterior pituitary hormones (ADH and oxytocin) are synthesized in hypothalamus and transported to posterior lobe by hypothalamohypophyseal nerve fiber tract and stored in the axon terminals of neurohypophysis in Herring bodies before their release.",
