Nothing is mentioned about the value of other enzymes.We cannot come to a conclusive diagnosis only by the level of Gamma glutamyl transpeptidaseBut still such a considerable elevation in the serum level of Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase i.e., 10 to 12 times its normal value points towards the diagnosis of biliary tract diseaseNote:- Normal value of serum Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase is - 10-40IU/L",

Kernicterus has developed when bilirubin levels exceed 30 mg/dL, although the range is wide (21-50 mg/dL).Its onset is usually in the 1st wk of life, but it may.be delayed to the 2nd-3rd wk.Kernicterus develops at lower bilirubin levels in preterm infants and in the presence of asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage, hemolysis, or drugs that displace bilirubin from albumin. The exact serum bilirubin level that is harmful for VLBW infants is unclear. Kernicterus does occur in patients with breast milk jaundice but is very uncommon.The surface of the brain is usually pale yellow. On cutting, certain regions are characteristically stained yellow by unconjugated bilirubinOvert neurologic signs have a grave prognosis; 75% or more of such infants die, and 80% of affected survivors have bilateral choreoathetosis with involuntary muscle spasms. Mental retardation, deafness, and spastic quadriplegia are common. Infants at risk should have screening hearing tests.",
