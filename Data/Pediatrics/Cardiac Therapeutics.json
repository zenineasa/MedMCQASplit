Adenosine may also be used in patients with wide QRS complex tachycardia.o Intravenous verapamil is contraindicated in neonates and infants because of the high risk of electromechanical dissociation. In older children (>5 years) and adolescents, verapamil may be administered with the same restrictions as in adult patients",
