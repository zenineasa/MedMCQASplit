        "exp": "Tics are commonly seen in a pediatric practice. All have in common the nonrhythmic, spasmodic, involuntary, stereotypical behaviors that involve any muscle group. Transient tic disorder is the most common and is seen more often in boys; a family history is often noted. In this condition, the patient has eye blinking, facial movements, or throat clearing lasting for weeks to about a year. No medications are needed. Chronic motor tics persist throughout life and can incorporate motor movements involving up to three muscle groups.Gilles de la Tourette syndrome is a lifelong condition that is characterized by motor and vocal tics, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and a high incidence of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADDH). Therapy for the ADDH is helpful, as is medication to control the motor or vocal tics. Multiple psychosocial problems exist with these children; a multidisciplinary approach is helpful.Dystonic reactions are sometimes seen in patients receiving phenothiazine medications. They have unusual neck, arm, or leg muscle twitches that are sometimes confused with seizure activity. Diphenhydramine, infused intravenously, usually rapidly reverses this relatively common idiosyncratic drug reaction.Cerebral palsy is a static condition of movement and posture disorders frequently associated with epilepsy and abnormalities of vision, speech, and intellect. A defect in the developing brain is felt to be the cause. No significant change in the incidence of cerebral palsy has been noted in the past few decades despite drastically improved obstetric and neonatal care. No treatment for cerebral palsy is available; a multidisciplinary approach to manage the many medical problems associated with the condition is helpful.The term \"chorea\" describes involuntary uncoordinated jerks of the arms and legs. Sydenham chorea is the most common acquired chorea of childhood, is seen after infections with group A b-hemolytic streptococci, and is associated with rheumatic heart disease and arthritis. In addition to the motor symptoms, patients may be hypotonic, emotionally labile, and have a \"milkmaid\" grip with sequential grip tightening and relaxing. Other findings include a darting tongue and \"spooning\" of an extended hand (flexion at the wrist and extension of the fingers).",

On examination, you confirm these findings and also notice that he has enlargement of his calves. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "The most common form of muscular dystrophy is Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Male infants are rarely diagnosed at birth or early infancy since they often reach gross milestones at the expected age. Soon after beginning to walk, however, the features of this disease become more evident. While these children walk at the appropriate age, the hip girdle weakness is seen by the age of 2 years. Increased lordosis, while standing, is evidence of gluteal weakness. Gower sign (use of the hands to \"climb up\" the legs in order to assume the upright position) is seen by 3 to 5 years of age, as is the hip waddle gait. Ambulation ability remains through about 7 to 12 years of age, after which use of a wheelchair is common. Associated features include mental impairment and cardiomyopathy. Death caused by respiratory failure, heart failure, pneumonia, or aspiration is common by early adulthood.",

This myopathy is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait; the gene is on chromosome 19 and codes for the ryanodine receptor, a calcium release channel. A family history of similarly affected relatives would suggest the need to evaluate all family members for this condition; prevention (or treatment) is with dantrolene sodium. The test of choice to identify a patient at risk for this condition is the caffeine contracture test, in which a muscle biopsy tissue specimen is attached to a strain gauge and then exposed to caffeine. Patients at risk for MH have a diagnostic muscle spasm. Ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene sequencing is also available.Acidification of the urine might be helpful for an aspirin overdose, but the child has no history of having aspirin ingestion. The findings in the question do not support tetanus (immunoglobulins not helpful) nor seizure activity (diazepam not indicated).

        "exp": "Ans. A. Duchenne Muscular hypertrophyDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe type of muscular dystrophy. The symptom of muscle weakness usually begins around the age of four in boys and worsens quickly. Females with a single copy of the defective gene may show mild symptoms. The disorder is X-linked recessive. Early features include a gait abnormality, which classically is a waddling, wide-based gait with hyper lordosis of the lumbar spine and toe walking. The Gower sign is a classic physical examination finding in MD and results from weakness in the child's proximal hip muscles. The second important phase in Duchenne MD is the loss of ambulation. This usually occurs between the ages of 7 and 13 years, with some patients becoming wheelchair-bound by age 6 years. Duchenne MD is a terminal disease in which death usually occurs by the third decade of life (mostly from cardiopulmonary compromise). Other clinical findings in Duchenne MD include absent deep tendon reflexes in the upper extremities and patella (though the Tendo Achillis reflex remains intact even in the later stages of this disease), pain in the calves with activity (<30% of patients), pseudohypertrophy of the calf (60%), and macroglossia (30%).",

Spinal fluid studies are notable for elevated protein only. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
        "exp": "The paralysis of Guillain-Barre often occurs about 10 days after a nonspecific viral illness. Weakness is gradual over days or weeks, beginning in the lower extremities and progressing toward the trunk. Later, the upper limbs and the bulbar muscles can become involved. Involvement of the respiratory muscles is life-threatening. The syndrome seems to be caused by a demyelination in the motor nerves and, occasionally, the sensory nerves. Measurement of spinal fluid protein is helpful in the diagnosis; protein levels are increased to more than twice normal, while glucose and cell counts are normal. Hospitalization for observation is indicated. Treatment can consist of observation alone, intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, or plasma-pheresis. Recovery is not always complete. Bell palsy usually follows a mild upper respiratory infection, resulting in the rapid development of weakness of the entire side of the face. Muscular dystrophy encompasses a number of entities that include weakness over months. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease has a clinical onset including peroneal and intrinsic foot muscle atrophy, later extending to the intrinsic hand muscles and proximal legs.
