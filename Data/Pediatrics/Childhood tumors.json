This usually occurs in the presence of a tumor of the pituitary, although in 80% of cases this has not been diagnosed previously.The most common initial symptom is a sudden headache, often associated with a rapidly worsening visual field defect or double vision caused by compression of nerves surrounding the gland.This is followed in many cases by acute symptoms caused by lack of secretion of essential hormones, predominantly adrenal insufficiency[?]Nasopharyngeal fibroma:Nasopharyngeal fibroma is a benign tumour but locally invasive and destroys the adjoining structures. It may extend into: Nasal cavity causing nasal obstruction, epistaxis and nasal discharge.Cranial cavity: Middle cranial fossa is the most common.There are two routes of entry:-By erosion of floor of middle cranial fossa, anterior to foramen lacerum. The tumour lies lateral to carotid artery & cavernous sinus.-Through sphenoid sinus, into the sella. Tumour lies medial to carotid artery.Surgical excision is now the treatment of choice. Radiotherapy has been used as a primary mode of treatment.Hormonal therapy as the primary or adjunctive treatment.Recurrent and residual lesions have been treated by chemotherapy.[?]Hypothalamic glioma:Rare tumors cause diencephalic syndrome in infants.Fail to thrive, loss of subcutaneous fat & suffer sleep & respiratory disturbances.Precocious puberty seen in older children.Associated histological types include glioma, pinealoma, teratomas & hamartomas.",

        "exp": "Ans a (Adrenal) Ref nelson 18th ed p 2137Neuroblastoma (NB) is an embryonal cancer of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system with heterogeneous clinical presentation and course. NB is the third most common pediatric cancer, NB is the most commonly diagnosed neoplasm in infants. Most cases of NB arise in the abdomen, either in the adrenal gland or in retroperitoneal sympathetic gan-glia.PATHOLOGY.NB includes a spectrum of tumors with variable degrees of neural differ-entiation, ranging from undifferenti- ated small round cells (neuroblastoma) to tumors containing mature ganglion cells (ganglioneuroblastoma or gan-glioneuroma).The tumors may resemble other small round cell tumors, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The prognosis varies with the histologic definition of tissue pattern (Shimada classification). Prognostic factors include the amount of stroma, degree of tumor cell differentiation, presence of enlarged and prominent nucleoli, and the mitosis-karyorrhexis index.Genetic characteristics of NB tumor tissue that are of prognostic importance and currently are used along with clinical factors to determine treatment include amplification of the MYCN (N-myc) proto-oncogene and hyperdiploidy of tumor cell DN A content. Amplification of MYCN has prognostic importance independent of stage and age and is strongly associated with advanced tumor stage and poor outcome. Hyperdiploidy confers better prognosis if the child is < 1 yr of age at diagnosis.NB may develop at any site of sympathetic nervous system tis-sue. The signs and symptoms of NB reflect the tumor site and extent of disease. Most cases of NB arise in the abdomen, either in the adrenal gland or in retroperitoneal sympathetic ganglia. Usually a firm, nodular mass that is palpable in the flank or midline is causing abdominal discomfort. On plain radiography or CT the mass often contains calcification and hemorrhage. Wilms tumor, another common flank mass in a young child, usually does not calcify.NB originates from cervical, thoracic, or pelvic ganglia in 30% of cases. Metastatic disease can be associated with myriad signs and symp-toms, including fever, irritability, failure to thrive, bone pain, bluish subcutaneous nodules, orbital proptosis, and periorbital ecchymoses. The most common sites of metastasis are the long bones and skull, bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, and skin. Lung metastases are rare, occurring in <3% of cases. Prenatal diagnosis of NB sometimes is possible on maternal ultrasound scans.",
