Most of the protein is whey proteins (lactalbumin and lactoglobulin), which can be digested easily (In contrast cow milk contains more casein).o Breast milk contains the ideal ratio of the amino acids cystine, taurine and methionine to support development of central and peripheral nervous system.C) Fatso Breast milk is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, necessary for the myelination of the nervous system and brain growth.o Active lipase in the breast milk promotes digestion of fats and provides FFA. The pattern of fats facilitates absorption of calcium.D) Mineralso Breast milk protects against neonatal hypocalcemia and tetany due to ideal calcium phosphorus ratio (2:1) and better calcium absorption.o Iron of breast milk is very well absorbed breast feeding prevents against iron deficiency anemiao Breast milk also prevents deficiencies of vitamin A, C, D, E and zinc.o Breast milk has a water content of 88% and hence a breastfed baby does not require additional water in the first 6 months of life even in summer months.o Breast milk has a low mineral and sodium content low osmolality presents a low solute load to the kidney.",

Docosahexanoic acid (Ref: CPDT M* e p2H6)The important fatty acid present in breast milk, which is important for baby growth is Docosahexanoic acid.\"Up to 5-10% of fatty acids in human milk are poly-unsaiurated Most of these are Linoleic acid with smaller amounts of Linolenic acid. Linoleic acid gives rise to arachidonic acid. Linolenic acid gives rise to Docosahexanoic acid Docosahexanoic acid is found in human milk and brain lipids and is requiredfor the development of our nervous system and visual abilities during the first six months of life. Lack of sufficient docosahexanoic acid may be associated with impaired mental and visual functioning as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. \"Breast milk contains all three types of essentia! fatty acids (EFAs)Omega-3Omega-6Omega-9* Breast milk is rich in omega -3 fatty acids.* Omega-3 fats come in three forms: as docosahexanoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (ERA) and alpha linolenic acid (ALA)* Breast milk contains EPA and DHA.* The body cannot produce these fats on its own, which is why these healthy fats are called essential fatty acids.* Omega-6 fats are also considered essential because these fatsare needed for heart and brain development* Linoleic acid and arachidonic acid (AHA) are omega-6 fats found in human breast milk.* The body is able to convert linoleic acid into gamma linolenic acid (GLA) when needed.* GLA is vital for proper organ functioning.* Omega-9 (Oleic acid) is healthy fat found in a mother's milk* Not as essential as omega-3 and omega-6, but this fatty acid still plays a vital role in the body.* Work as a back-up when thereis not enough omega-3 or-6 in the body.* When there is enough good fat in the body, omega-9 simply enhances the other fats.",
