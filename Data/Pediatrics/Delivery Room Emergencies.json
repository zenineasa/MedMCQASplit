(c) AMBU Bag Ventilation for 30 seconds with heart rate of 50Ref.: Nelson 18th ed., Chapter 100,* If the heart rate does not improve after 30 sec with bag and mask (or endotracheal) ventilation and remains below 100/min, ventilation is continued and chest compression should be initiated over the lower third of the sternum at a rate of 120/min. The ratio of compressions to ventilation is 3:1.* If the heart rate remains <60 despite effective compressions and ventilation, administration of epinephrine should be considered.* AAP guidelines are given below.",
