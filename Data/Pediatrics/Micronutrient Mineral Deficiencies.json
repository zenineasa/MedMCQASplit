The eyelids and mouth may have the appearance of being forced open due to the tightness of the skin. Collodion baby can have severe medial consequences, mainly because the baby can lose heat and fluid through the abnormal skin. This can lead to hypothermia and dehydration. Strategies to prevent these problems are the use of emollients or nursing the baby in a humidified incubator.",
