Thus, this option is also excluded.\nComing to hypoparathyroidism: As the name suggests, PTH is low in hypoparathyroidism. But, sometimes PTH may be in normal range (10-60 Pg/ml) and this is inappropriately normal PTH.\nHowever, it is generally believed that 'Normal' levels of PTH in a patient with hypocalcaemia indicate 'inappropri\u00adately normal PTH' and relative Hypoparathyroidism should always be considered as the initial diagnosis. `Serum PTH levels should be related to the concurrent serum calcium. High PTH is the normal response to hypocalcaemia and therefore 'normal' PTH in a patient with Hypocalcaemia indicates relative Hypoparathyroidism' \u00adPractical Algorithms in Pediatric Endocrinology' by Hochberg (2007)/71.\nBecause normally hypocalemia is a potent stimulus for secretion of PTH, patients with intact parathyroid gland function should be expected to have high circulating levels of PTH, during hypocalcaemia episodes.

The medication acts at V2 receptors, which are found on renal tubule cells, and mediates an anti-diuretic effect by increasing water permeability and water reabsorption in the collecting tubules, leading to decreased urine output. It is effective in 70% of patients with increased nocturnal urine output. Detrusor muscle tone is under control of the parasympathetic system. DDAVP does not affect this system. Some sympathomimetic drugs may cause enough wakefulness so that the child perceives the urge to void . Dextroamphetamine sulfate is one such medication. The external sphincter is under somatic nervous control. This medication does not contribute to this system. Ref: Goldson E., Reynolds A. (2012). Chapter 3. Child Development & Behavior. In W.W.

        "exp": "This item tests your knowledge of neurocutaneous syndromes, a group of hereditary conditions characterized by concomitant neoplastic or hamaomatous lesions predominantly affecting the skin and nervous system. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma is a peculiar astrocytic tumor that grows from the walls of the lateral ventricles. It is pathognomonic of tuberous sclerosis, which is caused by mutations of TS1 or TS2 genes. Tuberous sclerosis manifests with multiple hamaomatous lesions in the skin, CNS, and visceral organs. Coical tubers are malformed (hamaomatous) nodules of the coex, probably resulting from faulty coical development. Other lesions include shagreen patches and ash-leaf spots on the skin, cardiac myxomas, and renal angiomyolipomas. Cafe-au-lait spots are found in both types of neurofibromatosis. Lisch nodules are small pigmented nodular lesions of hamaomatous nature that are present in the iris of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Hemangioblastoma is a vascular tumor of unknown histologic origin that frequently develops in the cerebellum of patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Renal cell carcinomas are also common in this disease. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is caused by autosomal dominant mutations of the VHL gene, a tumor suppressor gene. You may recall that mutations of VHL gene are also found in the majority of sporadic renal cell carcinomas. Ref: Bernard T.J., Knupp K., Yang M.L., Kedia S., Levisohn P.M., Moe P.G. (2012).

Together, these cancers account for 63 percent of cases Early in the disease, leukemia may cause nonspecific symptoms similar to those of a viral infection. Leukemia should be suspected if persistent vague symptoms are accompanied by evidence of abnormal bleeding, bone pain, lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. The presenting symptoms of a brain tumor may include elevated intracranial pressure, nerve abnormalities and seizures. A spinal tumor often presents with signs and symptoms of spinal cord compression. In children, lymphoma may present as one or more painless masses, often in the neck, accompanied by signs and symptoms resulting from local compression, as well as signs and symptoms of systemic disturbances, such as fever and weight loss. A neuroblastoma may arise from sympathetic nervous tissue anywhere in the body, but this tumor most often develops in the abdomen. The presentation depends on the local effects of the solid tumor and any metastases. An abdominal mass in a child may also be due to Wilms' tumor. This neoplasm may present with renal signs and symptoms, such as hypeension, hematuria and abdominal pain.",

        "question": "A 30 week gestation mother delivered 1.2 mg baby with moderate respiratory distress. RR 70/min with grunting and chest retraction. Most logical next step is aEUR'",
        "exp": "CPAP The symptoms suggest neonatal respiratory distress syndrome / hyaline membrane disease. Respiratory distress syndrome / hyaline membrane disease occur because of inadequate production of surfactant. Since surfactant deficiency is the basis of RDS, exogenous surfactant is now recommended as the treatment of choice in neonates with RDS. - It is given to all neonates less than 28 weeks irrespective of presence or absence of RDS (Rescue treatment). -Beyond this age surfactant therapy is given according to the clinical condition of the patient. - If the distress is severe surfactant is required. - In the question the neonate is 32 weeks old and presents with moderate respiratory distress. - Surfactant is not necessary in such patient. Remember \"Surfactant is not universally indicated in all cases of respiratory distress syndrome\". Management of Respiratory distress syndrome Management of respiratory distress syndrome begins with admi-nistration of warm humidified oxygen. - This should maintain the aerial levels between 50 and 70 mm Hg (85-95% saturation) to maintain normal tissue oxygenation. If Pa02 cannot be maintained above 50 mm Hg at inspired 02 concentration of 60% or greater CPAP should be applied. - If the patient is VLBW (very low bih weight) then CPAP is used early (t/t begins with CPAP instead of oxygen). - Another approach in VLBW infant is to intuhate the infant, administer intracheal surfactant, then extubutate the patient and put him on CPAP. (In the question the infant is 1.5 kg at 32 weeks, his weight, for age is adequate). Infants with severe RDS require mechanical ventilation. According to Indian Journal of pediatrics Early cPAP in respiratory distress syndrome It is impoant to note that cPAP helps mainly by preventing the alveolar collapse in infants with surfactant deficiency. Once atelactasis and collapse have occurred cPAP might not help much. - Therefore all preterm infants < 35 weeks with any sign of respiratory distress should be staed immediately on cPAP. Prophylactic cPAP Extending the above logic some have advocated the use of prophylactic cPAP before the onset of respiratory distress in preterm VLBW infants as majority of them would eventually develop respiratory distress. However there is no evidence for any additional benefits with this approach, indeed there are concerns regarding increased adverse effect such as intraventricular hemorrhage. \"Hence prophylactic cPAP is not recommended at present\". Beneficial effects of cPAP Increase in functional residual capacity Increased pulmonary compliance Prevents alveolar collapse Increases airway diameter Conserves surfactant Decrease in alveolar aerial 02 pressure gradiant. More on cPAP Continuous positive airway pressure is a modality in which increased pulmonary pressure is provided during the expiratory phase of respiration in spontaneously breathing neonates. The mechanism by which CPAP produces its beneficial effects includes:? - Increased alveolar recruitment and stability - Redistribution of lung vvater This results in improved V/Q matching The administration of CPAP :? - Decreases oxygen requirements - Decreased need for mechanical ventilation and - Reduces moality and duration of respiratory assistance Indications of CPAP Inadequate aerial blood gas values - Inability to maintain a Pa02 greater than 50 mmHg with Fi02 .60. cPAP is initiated in newborns with RDS when Pa02 is approximately less than 50 mmHg on a Fi02 of .40. Abnormalities on physical examination - the presence of increased work of breathing as indicated by an increase in respiratory rate of >30% of normal, substernal and suprasternal retractions grunting and nasal flaring, the presence of pale or cyanotic skin colour and agitation. In treatment of RDS in both term and preterm infants. Prolonged and recurrent apneic attacks of prematurity. The presence of poorly expanded and / or infiltrated lung fields on chest radiograph. The presence of a condition thought to be responsive to CPAP and associated with one or more of the clinical presentation described above. - Respiratory distress syndrome - Pulmonary edema - Atelactasis - Apnea of prematurity - Recent extubation - Tracheal malacia or other similar abnormality of the lower airways - Transient tachyapnea of the newborn",

So, they are very prone to aspirate a foreign body. o The most common age group is 6 months to 4 years. o Most common foreign body aspirated is nuts (peanuts). o Most airway foreign bodies lodge in a bronchus (right more than left). Clinical manifestions Three stages of symptoms may results : - 1. Stage I - Initial event --> Violent paroxysm of coughing (most common symptom), choking, gagging and wheeze immediately after aspiration. If obstruction is complete, child may be unable to vocalize (aphonia) and there may be cyanosis. If obstruction is incomplete drooling and stridor may occur. 2. Stage H Asmptomatic --> The foreign body becomes lodged, reflex fatigue and immediate irritating symptoms subside. This stage is most tracherous and account for a large percentage of delayed diagnosis and overlooked foreign bodies. 3.

        "exp": "Ans. C: Dubin-Johnson Syndrome Dubin-Johnson syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes an increase of conjugated bilirubin without elevation of liver enzymes (ALT, AST). This condition is associated with a defect in the ability of hepatocytes to secrete conjugated bilirubin into the bile. The conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a result of defective endogenous and exogenous transfer of anionic conjugates from hepatocytes into the bile. Pigment deposition in lysosomes causes the liver to turn black. Other causes of conjugated/direct hyperbilirubinemia: Hepatocellular diseases: - Hepatitis: Neonatal idiopathic hepatitis Viral (Hepatitis B, C, TORCH infections) Bacterial (E. colt, urinary tract infections) - Total parenteral nutrition - Hepatic ischemia (post-ischemic damage) - Erythroblastosis fetalis (late, \"Inspissated Bile Syndrome\") Metabolic disorders: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Galactosemia, tyrosinemia, fructosemia Glycogen storage disorders Cystic fibrosis Biliary tree abnormalities: - Extrahepatic biliary atresia: In first 2 weeks, unconjugated bilirubin predominates; elevated conjugated bilirubin is late. - Paucity of bile ducts - Choledochal cyst - Bile plug syndrome Causes of unconjugated/indirect hyperbilirubinemia: Increased lysis of RBCs (i.e., increased hemoglobin release) - Isoimmunization (blood group incompatibility: Rh, ABO and minor blood groups) - RBC enzyme defects (e.g., G6PD deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency) - RBC structural abnormalities (hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis) - Infection (sepsis, urinary tract infections) - Sequestered blood (e.g., cephalohematoma, bruising, intracranial hemorrhage) - Neonatal Jaundice - Polycythemia - Shoened life span of fetal RBCs Decreased hepatic uptake and conjugation of bilirubin - Immature glucuronyl transferase activity in all newborns: term infants have 1% of adult activity, preterm infants have 0.1%. - Gilbe Syndrome - Crigler Najjar Syndrome (Non-hemolytic Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia): inherited conjugation defect (very rare) - Breastmilk Jaundice (pregnanediol inhibits glucuronyl transferase activity) Increased enterohepatic reabsorption - Breastfeeding jaundice (due to dehydration from inadequate milk supply)",

Coming back to question Sorry guys i could not find any reference which clearly mention the answer of this question. o According to me the best answer is 4 months because renal involvement may be seen up to 3 months after the onset of other symptoms (examiner is asking about the renal involvement after onset of disease, not after the onset of other symptoms). \"Renal manifestations usually sta at the onset or within 3 months of the onset of other symptoms\" - Pediatric nephrology o Other symptoms, e.g. rash, will also take some time to appear after the onset of disease.

Pink color (look at tougue and lips) Term gestation (delivery between 37-42 weeks of pregnancy). o If all signs are positive no active resuscitation is required. o If any of the 5 signs is absent, baby requires resuscitation. o The baby should be placed under the heat source (radiant warmer) and subjected to a set of intervention known as initial steps. Initial steps of resuscitation 1. Positioning The neonate should be placed on her back or side with the neck slightly extended. This can be achieved by putting a rolled blanket or towel under the shoulders, elevating them 3/4 or 1 inch off the mattress. 2. Suctioning The mouth and nose should be suctioned The mouth is suctioned first to ensure that there is nothing for the infant to aspirate when the nose is suctioned. One should not inse the catheter very deep in mouth or nose for suction -4 Stimulation of posterior pharynx during the first few minutes after bih can produce a vagal responce, causing severe bradycardia or apnea. 3.

It is more successful in patients with isolated intestinal perforation. In many patients, no further surgical procedure is required.\nPeritoneal drainage is performed under local anaesthesia. Alpenrose drain is placed in the right lower quadrant and permitted to drain peritoneal contents and decompress the abdomen. This procedure is employed predominantly in infants less than 1000g who have severe SIRS and are viewed as too unstable to be transported or to undergo laparotomy. In experienced hands, one-third of the patients require only drain placement.\nA primary anastomosis at the time of initial surgery is indicated in patients with limited localized disease who have no distal bowel involvement and in patients who have demonstrated a walled-off perforation who are no longer manifesting the SIRS.\n\nFrom this discussion, we choose the answer to be peritoneal drainage because:\n\nPatients are on a ventilator (too unstable).\nSurgery for NEC is resection and creation of an ileostomy, which is not given in the options.\nPrimary anastomosis is done only in stable patients with walled-off perforation.",

Through Patent ductus aeriosus Oxygenation is normal in foetus but after bih as ductus aeriosus closes severe hypoxia occurs and in the absence of VS.D, or ASD child presents with cyanosis and tachypnea at bih.

Constriction of the ductus postnatally involves a complex interaction of increased paial pressure of oxygen, decreased circulating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), decreased PGE2 ductal receptors, and decreased pressure within the ductus. Subsequent vessel-wall hypoxia of the ductus promotes fuher closure through inhibition of prostaglandin and nitric oxide within the ductal wall. For premature infants, treatment with indomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor, is usually the first-line therapy. Ibuprofen has achieved closure rates equivalent to those of indomethacin with less renal toxicity. When PDA fails to close with indomethacin or for term infants with a persistent PDA, surgical or interventional closure is recommended. Ref: Brown D.W., Fulton D.R. (2011). Chapter 83.

The greatest risk associated with hyperbilirubinemia is the development of kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy) at high indirect serum bilirubin levels. The level of serum bilirubin associated with kernicterus is dependent in pa on the cause of the jaundice. Kernicterus has developed when bilirubin levels exceed 30 mg/dL, although the range is wide (21-50 mg/dL). Its onset is usually in the 1st wk of life, but it may_be delayed to the 2nd-3rd wk. Kernicterus develops at lower bilirubin levels in preterm infants and in the presence of asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage, hemolysis, or drugs that displace bilirubin from albumin. The exact serum bilirubin level that is harmful for VLBW infants is unclear. Kernicterus does occur in patients with breast milk jaundice but is very uncommon. The surface of the brain is usually pale yellow. On cutting, ceain regions are characteristically stained yellow by unconjugated bilirubin Ove neurologic signs have a grave prognosis; 75% or more of such infants die, and 80% of affected survivors have bilateral choreoathetosis with involuntary muscle spasms.

Ecchymoses, muscle hematomas, prolonged bleeding following trauma and hemahroses also are characteristic. PT and aPTT are normal in factor XIII deficiency. Diagnosis of factor XIII deficiency is established by demonstrating increased clot solubility in 5 M urea, dilute monochloroacetic acid, or acetic acid. Factor XIII activity also can be determined quantitatively by a chromogenic assay or by an incorporation assay. Ref: Seligsohn U., Zivelin A., Salomon O. (2010). Chapter 125.

Sholy thereafter it was discovered to be a cause of neonatal liver disease, and now it is known to be a cause of liver disease in infancy, early childhood, adolescence, and in adults. The natural history of liver disease in alAT deficiency is quite variable. Many individuals with the ZZ genotype never develop disease throughout their entire lives. a1AT deficiency becomes apparent in adults because of screening for liver disease in individuals who have liver function test abnormalities. The only hint to diagnosis may be coexistent lung disease at a relatively young age or a family history of liver and/or lung disease. Diagnosis is established by determining a reduced serum level of alAT as well as the performance of a1AT genotyping. Liver biopsy in a1AT disease shows characteristic PAS-positive diastase-resistant globules in the periphery of the hepatic lobule. Treatment Treatment of a1AT is nonspecific and suppoive. Liver transplantation is curative. Recombinant AT administered IV has been used in patients with chronic lung disease due to 1AT deficiency but is of no benefit in patients with a1AT liver disease.",

In its most severe form, the cystic kidneys are nonfunctional in utero, and, therefore, newborns can have Potter facies and other complications of oligohydramnios.

The rate of the progression of renal insufficiency varies, as does growth failure and other complications of chronic renal failure. Two genes (ADPKD1 and ADPKD2) account for 80% and 10% of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, respectively.

A patent ductus aeriosus (PDA) occurs when the ductus aeriosus fails to close after bih. With a PDA, congestive hea failure (CHF) can occur because of chronic left hea volume overload. In patients with death related to PDA, CHF is the most common cause. Development of right-left shunt is also a poor prognostic indicator.
