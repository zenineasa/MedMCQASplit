        "exp": "The correct answer is A (Pasteurella multocida), a gram-negative rod that frequents the mouths of some animals, paicularly cats, but also dogs. The extreme sharpness of feline teeth causes enormous pressure at the site of the puncture during a bite, allowing inoculation of the organism deep into tissues. B (Baonella henselae) is incorrect, although it is a gram-negative rod associated with exposure to cats. In immunocompetent hosts, the principal condition caused by this organism, which is carried mainly on the paws of cats, is cat scratch disease, whose name implies transmission by cat scratches not cat bites. C (Streptobacillus moniliformis) is also a gram-negative rod, pleomorphic, which is most commonly acquired by the bite or scratch of rats or mice. Although it may be carried--and transmitted--by carnivores that prey on these rodents, it is less characteristically associated with cat induced injuries than with rat or mouse exposure. The simplest reason that D (Lactobacillus casei) cannot be a correct answer because it is a gram-positive rod, not a gram-negative one.",

This patient has several risk factors for DVT- He is obese, diabetic, and has been inactive because of postoperative bed rest, with the latter producing venous stasis. Although gynecological and ohopedic surgeries especially predispose individuals to DVT, any surgery increases the risk. Prevention of DVT includes using lower-limb compression devices during and after surgery. Anticoagulant therapy, such as small-dose heparin, is also sometimes given before surgery and for 1 or 2 days postoperatively. If DVT is confirmed with ultrasound or radiologically with venous contrast (venogram), anticoagulation therapy is impoant to decrease the risk of pulmonary embolism.",

If the amputation is insufficient, it may leave behind tissue whose blood supply is compromised to the point that oxygen tension in the remaining stump ours the growth of anaerobes. The elaboration, by C. perfringens, of large amounts of gas that are not absorbed by the tissues allows the clostridial organisms to spread along fascial planes, which are separated by the pressure of the gas as the clostridia grows.

Infected humans inevitably excrete S. haematobium eggs in their urine, which finds its way into the water. Once thus excreted, these eggs develop into a very motile form called a miracidium that \"homes in\" on the intermediate host, which is a snail. In the snail, the fluke metamorphoses into a form called a cercaria, which swims freely in the water, waiting to penetrate the intact skin of a person who may be swimming or wading in this water. Once in the human, S. haematobium develops into adults, which migrate to the veins of the vesical plexus around the bladder. The female lays eggs, which create an inflammatory response that leads to bleeding, which is perceived by the infected individual as gross haematuria. The passage of these eggs, in urine, into water inhabited by the correct species of snail, completes the life cycle. The arrow points towards a terminal spine and when obtained from urinary bladder, is characteristic of S. hematobium species.

Typically, the dislocation is also inferior such that the humeral head is located inferior and lateral to the coracoid process. The humeral head will often have an infraglenoid and infraclavicular position. The diagnosis may be difficult to make.

Methotrexate's principal mechanism of action at the low doses used in the rheumatic diseases probably relates to inhibition of amino-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase and thymidylate synthetase. AICAR, which accumulates intracellularly, competitively inhibits AMP deaminase, leading to an accumulation of AMP. The AMP is released and conveed extracellularly to adenosine, which is a potent inhibitor of inflammation. As a result, the inflammatory functions of neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes are suppressed. There is some effect on dihydrofolate reductase and this affects lymphocyte and macrophage function, but this is not its principal mechanism of action. Methotrexate has direct inhibitory effects on proliferation and stimulates apoptosis in immunoinflammatory cells. Additionally, it inhibits proinflammatory cytokines linked to rheumatoid synovitis.",

Reduced range of motion of the knee and tenderness along the joint line are also common signs of an acute ACL injury.

These symptoms typically appear after meals, paicularly fatty meals. The more concerning signs are the light-colored stools (acholic) and jaundice (icterus). Gallstones (cholelithiasis) are precipitated bile salts in the gallbladder, which may produce inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis). Stones can pass into the cystic duct and into the common bile duct. Since the common bile duct is formed by the union of the cystic and common hepatic ducts, obstruction of the common bile duct prevents bilirubin produced in the liver from reaching the small intestines. The stools thus lack this pigment. As a secondary result of the obstruction, serum bilirubin is elevated, and precipitates in the skin, resulting in the yellow tint. Ultrasound (DOUBLE BARREL/DUCT SIGN) can often make the initial diagnosis. Removal of a common bile duct stone can be performed by upper GI endoscopy through the ampulla of Vater or surgically.",
