        "question": "The hypothesis 'Greater in the lipid solubility of the compound in olive oil, the greater is its anesthetic potency'is referred to as -",
        "exp": "Ans- A Meyer-Overton rule Ref- Inhaled anaesthetic agents act in different ways at the level of the central nervous system. They may disrupt normal synaptic transmission by interfering with the release of neurotransmitters from pre-synaptic nerve terminal (enhance or depress excitatory or inhibitory transmission), by altering the re-uptake of neurotransmitters, by changing the binding of neurotransmitters to the post-synaptic receptor sites or by influencing the ionic conductance change that follows activation of the post-synaptic receptor by neurotransmitters. Both pre- and post-synaptic effects have been found. Direct interaction with the neuronal plasma membrane is very likely, but indirect action via production of a second messenger also remains possible. The high correlation between lipid solubility and anaesthetic potency suggests that inhalational anaesthetic agents have a hydrophobic site of action. Inhalational agents may bind to both membrane lipids and proteins. It is not clear which of the different theories are most likely to be the main mechanism of action of inhalational anaesthetic agents. The Meyer-Overton theory describes the correlation between lipid solubility of inhaled anaesthetics and MAC and suggests that anaesthesia occurs when a sufficient number of inhalational anaesthetic molecules dissolve in the lipid cell membrane. The Meyer-Overton theory postulates that it is the number of molecules dissolved in the lipid cell membrane, and not the type of inhalational agent, that causes anaesthesia. Combinations of different inhaled anesthetics may have additive effects at the level of the cell membrane. Exceptions to the Meyer-Overton rule Enflurane and isoflurane are structural isomers and have similar oil:gas partition coefficients. However, the MAC for isoflurane is only approximately 70% of that for enflurane; thus, it would appear that there are other factors which influence potency. These include: Convulsant properties Complete halogenation, or complete end-methyl halogenation of alkanes and ethers results in decreased anaesthetic potency and the appearance of convulsant activity. Specific receptors For a given MAC reduction, plasma levels of morphine, alfentanyl, sufentanyl and fentanyl vary around 5000 fold. Levels of these four agents in brain lipid vary 10 fold; thus, studies of the reduction in MAC by opioids suggests two sites of action: the opioid receptor and some hydrophobic site. D-medetomidine This alpha-2-agonist results in a marked reduction in MAC, whereas its optical isomer, with identical lipid solubility, has no effect. Hydrophilic site of action L. Pauling & S. Miller (1961) independently proposed that anaesthesia may result from the formation of clatharates of water in membranes. In this model, anaesthetic molecules act as seeds for crystals of water, which subsequently alter membrane ion transport. This is less likely than the unitary theory, as there is a poor correlation between the ability of agents to form clatharates and their anaesthetic potency. Traube (1904) and Clements & Wilson (1962) proposed that potency correlated with a reduction in surface tension. However, these latter physical properties are closely related to those properties which determine hydrophobicity. Hence, the Meyer-Overton theory does not describe why anaesthesia occurs. Mullins expanded the Meyer-Overton rule by adding the 'Critical Volume Hypothesis'. He stated that the absorption of anaesthetic molecules could expand the volume of a hydrophobic region within the cell membrane and subsequently distort channels necessary for sodium ion flux and the development of action potentials necessary for synaptic transmission. The fact that anaesthesia occurs with a significant increase in the volume of hydrophobic solvents and is reversible by compressing the volume of the expanded hydrophobic region of the cell membrane supports Mullins' 'Critical Volume Hypothesis'. The protein receptor hypothesis postulates that protein receptors in the central nervous system are responsible for the mechanism of action of inhaled anaesthetics. This theory is supported by the steep dose-response curve for inhaled anaesthetics. However, it remains unclear if inhaled agents disrupt ion flow through membrane channels by an indirect action on the lipid membrane, via a second messenger or by direct and specific binding to channel proteins. Another theory describes the activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors by the inhalational anaesthetics. Volatile agents may activate GABA channels and hyperpolarise cell membranes. In addition, they may inhibit certain calcium channels and therefore prevent the release of neurotransmitters and inhibit glutamate channels. Volatile anaesthetics therefore may share common cellular actions with other sedative, hypnotic and analgesic drugs.",

        "question": "All of the following are true about phrenic nerve, except-",
        "exp": "Ans- A Ref- The phrenic nerve is a bilateral, mixed nerve that originates in the neck and descends through the thorax to reach the diaphragm. As the only source of motor innervation to the diaphragm, this nerve has an important role in breathing. In this article, we shall look at the anatomy of the phrenic nerve - its anatomical course, motor and sensory functions. Overview Nerve roots: Anterior rami of C3, C4 and C5. Motor functions: Innervates the diaphragm. Sensory functions: Innervates the central part of the diaphragm, the pericardium and the mediastinal part of the parietal pleura. Anatomical Course The phrenic nerve mainly originates from the C4 spinal root, but it also receives contributions from C3 and C5. It also receives some communicating fibres from the cervical plexus. The nerve begins at the lateral border of the anterior scalene muscle. It then continues inferiorly over the anterior surface of anterior scalene, deep to the prevertebral layer of deep cervical fascia. From here, the course of the phrenic nerve differs between the left and right: Right Phrenic Nerve: Passes anteriorly to second part of the subclavian artery, and posteriorly to the subclavian vein. Enters the thorax via the superior thoracic aperture. Descends anteriorly to the right lung root, down the right side of the pericardium. Reaches the diaphragm and pierces the muscle to supply the underlying surface. Left Phrenic Nerve: Passes anteriorly to the first part of the subclavian artery, and posteriorly to the subclavian vein. Enters the thorax via the superior thoracic aperture. Crosses the aortic arch and vagus nerve, and descends anteriorly to the left lung root, down the left side of the pericardium. Reaches the diaphragm and pieces the muscle to supply the underlying surface. By TeachMeSeries Ltd (2018) Fig 1.0 - The origin of the phrenic nerve from the anterior rami of C3,4 and 5. Motor Functions The phrenic nerve provides motor innervation to the diaphragm; the main muscle of respiration. As the phrenic nerve is a bilateral structure, each nerve supplies the ipsilateral side of the diaphragm (i.e. the hemi-diaphragm on the same side as itself). Sensory Functions Sensory fibres from the phrenic nerve supply the central part of the diaphragm, including the surrounding pleura and peritoneum. The nerve also supplies sensation to the mediastinal pleura and the pericardium. By TeachMeSeries Ltd (2018) Fig 1.1 - The phrenic nerve provides sensory innervation to the diaphragm, mediastinal pleura and pericardium. Clinical Relevance: Diaphragmatic Paralysis The phrenic nerve provides motor innervation to the diaphragm. If the nerve becomes damaged, paralysis of the diaphragm will result. Causes of phrenic nerve palsy include: Mechanical trauma - ligation or damage to the nerve during surgery. Compression - due to a tumour within the chest cavity. Neuropathies - such diabetic neuropathy. Paralysis of the diaphragm produces a paradoxical movement. The affected side of the diaphragm moves upwards during inspiration, and downwards during expiration. A unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is usually asymptomatic, and is most often an incidental finding on x-ray. If both sides are paralysed, the patient may experience poor exercise tolerance, orthopnoea and fatigue. Lung function tests will show a restrictive deficit. Management of diaphragmatic paralysis is two-fold. Firstly, the underlying cause must be identified and treated (if possible). The second part of treatment deals with symptomatic relief. This is usually via non-invasive ventilation, such as a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure).

These patients are therefore at risk for severe GERD and subsequent complications of peptic stricture and Barrett's esophagus. Although there is no corrective therapy to improve esophageal motility or increase LES pressure, aggressive treatment is generally aimed at reducing acid production with the use of high doses of proton pump inhibitors.

        "question": "Surgical scissors left in the abdomen is covered under which doctrine -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e. Res ipsa loquitor o Leaving scissors in the abdomen at the time of surgery is an example of criminal negligence in which the evidence speaks for itself and is thus covered under Res IpsaLoquitorDoctrine related with negligenceResp Ipsa Loquitar (fact speaks for itself): Generally the innocence of doctor is assumed and the patient has to establish the guilt, However, it is not required to prove negligence in a case where the doctrine of resp Ipsa loquitar applies; rather the doctor has to defend himself.Calculated risk doctrine: It is a defense to doctor. It states that 'resp Ipsa loquitar' should not be applied when the complained injury may have occurred even through proper care has been taken.The doctrine of common knowledge: Is a variant of res ipsa loquitar in which patient has to prove the negligence but he need not produce evidence to establish the standard of care (in res ipsa loquitar both are not required). It is based on assumption that the doctor will be held responsible for negligence in particular case which is within the common knowledge of medical practitioner e.g. not giving fluids in dehydrated or ATS in injuries.Diagnostic or Therapeutic misadventure: It is the occurrence of misadventure causing injury' or death of the patient due to the inherent risk of procedure or drug, e.g. adverse effects of a drug. It is unintentional.Medical maloccurance (inevitable accident or Act of God): On certain occasions, despite all proper care given by doctor during treatment, the patient may fail to respond properly or may suffer adverse reactions of the drug. It is due to biological variations in different people.Novus Actus interventions : A person is responsible for his actions and its consequences. This principle applies to cases of assault or accidental injuries. However, sometime such continuty of events is broken by an entirely new and unexpected happening, due to negligence of some other person, i.e. novus actus intervenient (an unrelated action intervening). For example. If a person has been assaulted due to which he has sustained large liver laceration, for which he is operated by a surgeon. If the patient dies intraoperative ly or postopratively due to complications related to surgery or injury, the person who has assaulted the patient will be held responsible. But, if the doctor has done some negligent act during surgery', e.g. left the swab or instrument in abdomen during surgery-; and patient dies because of that act (sepsis due to swab), then the response may pass from original incident to later negligent act of doctor by principle of 'novus actus intervention' (an unrelated action intervening). This doctor is responsible for the negligent act, i.e. criminal negligence(PGI 93,AP and the assailant will not be fully responsible for the ultimate harm.Contributory' negligence : It is defined as concurrent or simultaneous negligence of doctor and patient so as to lead to damage to the patient. Normally it is only a partial defence and court has right to fix liabilities between doctor and patient (doctrine of comparative negligence) and damages awarded may be reduced accordingly. Contributory' negligence can be used as defence by the doctor, but in civil cases only. It cannot be used as defence in followingCriminal negligenceLast clear chance doctrine ; i.e. if doctor has discovered it before causing injury' and failed to avoid that,Avoidable consequences rule ; i.e. due to negligence of doctor, there occurs damage to patient, but due to later damage of patient, damage becomes more.Good samartion doctrine : One who assisted another in serious need cannot be charged for contributory' negligence, provided that the assistance is not rash and reckless.Vicarious responsibility (Liability): It means master is liable for negligent acts of his serv ants, even inspite of absence of blame-worthy conduct on his part. Thus hospital and senior medical staff are responsible for negligent act of junior medical staff (interns and resident doctors). This responsibility is there because of master servant relationship, i.e. the senior can dictate the line of treatment to be followed. However, hospital is not responsible for senior medical staff as master servent relationship does not exist. The vicarious responsibility is there only in civil negligence cases and not in criminal cases.Borrow ed servant doctrine (captain of the ship doctrine): The private practitioner, who is not a staff of a private hospital, will be held responsible for all the negligent acts by any of the hospital staff on the patient admitted by him. The hospital will not be held here liable, because all the instructions for the patient admitted is carried on by hospital staff as told by private practitioner (i.e. he is the captain of the ship).Product liability : Manufacturer is liable for quality of drug and medical equipment.",

        "exp": "Ans: A (Somat.), C (DNA..) & D (Appro..) Gene switching (tor class switching) is also observed in formation of lg. The primary immune response is the formation of IgM immunoglobulin. This is followed by secondary immune response in formation of IgG immunoglobulin\" - Chatterjea &Shinde 7th/258Ig Gene Rearrangement and Expression# As a cell differentiates into a mature B cell that will make a light chain, there is a rearrangement of the various genes (exons) and the gene begins to be expressedThe orderly sequence nf rearrangements in the immunoglobulin gene families explains;Why an individual B celi can only produce one kind of immunoglobulin with one kind of heavy and one kind of light chain.Why a individual B cell can only make antibodies of one specificity.Why there is allelic exclusion in immunoglobulin allotypes at the level of an individual immunoglobulin molecule but codominant expression of allotypes in the organism as a whole.Antibody diversityRefers to the sum total of all the possible antibody specificities that an organism can make, it is estimated that we can make 107 - 108 different antibody molecules. One of the major questions in immunology has been how can we make so many different antibody molecules.Theories which have attempted to explain the origin of antibody diversity fall into two major categories.Germ line theory: This theory states that we have a different V region gene for each possible antibody we can make.Somatic mutation theory :This theory states that we have only one or a few V region genes and the diversity is generated by somatic mutations which occur in these genesIt is thought that antibody diversity is generated by the following mechanisms1 A large number of V genesThere are:a) 30 lambda V genes; b) 300 kappa V genes; c) 1000 heavy chain V genes2 V-J and V-D-J joiningThe region where the light chain :V gene and J region or the heavy chain V gene and D and J regions come together is in the third hypervariable region. Since it is random which V and which J or D regions come together, there is a lot of diversity that can be generated by V-J 3nd V-D-J joining.3 Junctional diversity (Inaccuracies in V-J and V-D and D-J recombinationRecombination between V-J and V-D-J is not always perfect and additional diversity can arise by errors that occur in the recombination event that brings the V region next to the J or D regions or the D region next to the J region. It is estimated that these inaccuracies can triple the diversity generated by V-J and V-D-J joining. The diversity generated by this4 N region insertionAt the junction between D and J segments there is often an insertion of a series of nucleotides which is catalyzed by the enzyme terminal transferase. Terminal transferase catalyzes the random polymerization of nucleotides into DMA without the need for a template. This leads to further diversity' in the third hypervariable region.5 Somatic MutationThere is evidence that somatic mutations are occurring in the V gene, particularly in the place that codes for the second hypervariable region. Thus, somatic mutation probably contributes to antibody diversity to some extent.6 Combinatorial AssociationAny individual B cell has the potential to make anyone of the possible heavy chai ns and any one of the possible light chains. Thus, different combinations of heavy and light chains within an individual B cell adds further diversity.7 MultispecificityDue to cross reactions between antigenic determinants of similar structure an antibody can often react with more than one antigenic determinant. This is termed multispecificity. Multispecificity also contributes to antibody diversityB Cell Receptor (Immunoglobulin) HeavyKappaV gene segments1000300D gene segments15-| gene segments44N region insertion++-Junctional diversity++++Somatic mutation++Combinatorial associationV x D x J1000 X 15 X 4V x J300x4Total6 x 1041.2 x 103Combinatorial association7.2 xl07",

        "question": "The first drug of choice for Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH):",
        "exp": "Ans- C Ref- Recommendations for PPH treatment The use of uterotonics (oxytocin alone as the first choice) plays a central role in the treatment of PPH (see Boxes 4and 5). Uterine massage is recommended for the treatment of PPH as soon as it is diagnosed (see Box 6) and the initial fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids is recommended. The use of tranexamic acid is advised in cases of refractory atonic bleeding or persistent trauma-related bleeding (see Box 5). The use of intrauterine balloon tamponade is recommended for refractory bleeding or if uterotonics are unavailable. Bimanual uterine compression, external aortic compression, and the use of non-pneumatic anti-shock garments are recommended as temporizing measures until substantive care is available. If there is persistent bleeding and the relevant resources are available, uterine artery embolization should be considered. If bleeding persists despite treatment with uterotonic drugs and other conservative interventions, surgical intervention should be used without further delay. Box 4 Recommendations for the treatment of PPH - uterotonics. Intravenous oxytocin is the recommended uterotonic drug for the treatment of PPH. (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence) If intravenous oxytocin is unavailable, or if the bleeding does (more...) Box 5 Recommendations for the treatment of PPH - fluid resuscitation and tranexamic acid. The use of isotonic crystalloids is recommended in preference to the use of colloids for the intravenous fluid resuscitation of women with PPH. (Strong recommendation, (more...)

(Strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence) If women do not respond to treatment using uterotonics, or if uterotonics (more...) If the third stage of labour lasts more than 30 minutes, CCT and IV/IM oxytocin (10 IU) should be used to manage the retained placenta. If the placenta is retained and bleeding occurs, the manual removal of the placenta should be expedited. Whenever the manual removal of the placenta is undertaken, a single dose of prophylactic antibiotics is recommended (see Box 7). Box 7 Recommendations for the treatment of retained placenta. If the placenta is not expelled spontaneously, the use of additional oxytocin (10 IU, IV/IM) in combination with controlled cord traction is recommended. (Weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence) (more...) The GDG also issued recommendations related to the organization of PPH care (see Box 8). Health facilities delivering maternity services should adopt formal protocols for the prevention and treatment of PPH and for patient referral. The use of PPH treatment simulations for pre-service and in-service training programmes was recommended. Finally, the GDG recommended that the use of uterotonics for the prevention of PPH should be monitored and a specific indicator was suggested. Box 8 Health Systems and Organization of Care recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PPH. The use of formal protocols by health facilities for the prevention and treatment of PPH is recommended. (Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) (more...) The GDG found insufficient evidence to recommend one route over another for the prevention of PPH with oxytocin, the use of recombinant factor VIIa for the treatment of PPH, intraumbilical vein injection of oxytocin for treatment of retained placenta, and the antenatal distribution of misoprostol. The GDG also found insufficient evidence to recommend self-administration for the prevention of PPH and the measurement of blood loss over clinical estimation (see Box 9).

There is insufficient evidence to recommend one oxytocin route over another for the prevention of PPH. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use (more...)

        "exp": "Ans is 'a' i.e. Intense attention \"Beta and gamma waves (20-80Hz) occur spontaneously during REM sleep and waking and are evoked by intense attention, conditioned responses, tasks requiring fine movements and sensory stimuli.\" - The Neuroscience of Sleep, p.24 EEG rhythms (Berger's rhythm) and sleep wake cycle 1) Alpha rhythm: - In adult humans who are awake but at rest with mind wandering and the eye closed, a-rhythm is prominent. It is a regular rhythm with a frequency of 8-13 Hz and amplitude of 50-100 m V. It is most marked in parietal and occipital lobe. It is associated with decreased level of attention, i.e., person is awake but has decreased attention (relaxed) - Person is thinking but with decreased attention (subconscious thinking). 2) Beta rhythm:- When attention is focused on something, the alpha rhythm is replaced by Beta rhythm. It is an irregular 13-30 Hz low voltage activity. It is most evident on frontal lobe and occurs when patient is fully awake and alert. Therefore this replacement of beta rhythm for alpha rhythm is called arousal or alerting response or alpha block. This phenomenon can be produced by any form of sensor stimulation or mental concentration such as solving arithmetic problems. Person is thinking with a maximum concentration - Conscious thinking. 3) Theta rhythm:- When person with alpha rhythm becomes slightly more relaxed (as occurs when there is transition from wakefullness to sleep, i.e., stage 1 of NREM), alpha rhythm is replaced by theta rhythm. Thinking is present but with even less attentiveness than which was present in alpha rhythm stage (Deep subcsoncious thinking). Two types of theta rhythm have been described:- i) Hippocampal (occurs in mammals other than men, i.e., cat dogs, etc). ii) Cortical (occurs in men). 4) Delta rhythm:- It is present when the person is in deep sleep (NREM stage 3 & 4) and there is no thinking.",

        "exp": "Pheochromocytoma are neoplasms composed of chromaffin cells, which synthesize and release catecholamines and in some instances peptide hormones. It is important to recognize these tumors because they are a rare cause of surgically correctable hypertension. Pheochromocytoma range from small, circumscribed lesions confined to the adrenal to large hemorrhagic masses weighing kilograms. The tumors are composed of polygonal to spindle-shaped chromaffin cells or chief cells, clustered with the sustentacular cells into small nests or alveoli (zellballen) by a rich vascular network. The cytoplasm has a finely granular appearance, best demonstrated with silver stains, due to the presence of granules containing catecholamines. The nuclei are usually round to ovoid, with a stippled \u201csalt and pepper\u201d chromatin that is characteristic of neuroendocrine tumors.\nThere is no histologic feature that reliably predicts clinical behavior. Several histologic features, such as numbers of mitoses, confluent tumor necrosis, and spindle cell morphology, have been associated with an aggressive behavior and increased risk of metastasis, but these are not entirely reliable. Tumors with \u201cbenign\u201d histologic features may metastasize, while bizarrely pleomorphic tumors may remain confined to the adrenal gland. In fact, cellular and nuclear pleomorphism, including the presence of giant cells, and mitotic figures are often seen in benign pheochromocytomas, while cellular monotony is paradoxically associated with an aggressive behavior. Even capsular and vascular invasion may be encountered in benign lesions. Therefore, the definitive diagnosis of malignancy in pheochromocytomas is based exclusively on the presence of metastases.

Severe liver damage disrupts normal amino acid metabolism and is reflected in elevated serum levels of non-branched-chain amino acids. Since urea cannot be produced, ammonia cannot be handled. Elevated levels of serum ammonia certainly playa large role in the development of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver failure and portal hypertension. Therefore, levels of ammonia and, in the case of alkylosis, ammonium ion rise at the expense of urea. Other mechanisms leading to increased blood ammonia levels include excessive amounts of intestinal nitrogen (e.g., resulting from bleeding); decreased intestinal motility allowing greater bacterial deamination of amino acids; depressed renal function leading to an increase in blood urea nitrogen and a greater opportunity for bacterial urease to convert this to ammonia; alkalosis, which will preferentially lead the NHt /NH3 equilibrium in favor of ammonia; and portal hypertension, which will allow ammonia from the gut to bypass hepatic detoxification.",

Book of Obstetrics, 7th edition. Explanation: Loss of deep tendon reflex is the first sign of hypermagnesemia. The following should be monitored when a patient is on magnesium sulfate therapy : The patellar reflex should be present. Respiration should not be depressed. Urine output should be more than 100ml/4 hours. Pritchard/ IM regime Loading dose: 4g IV over 3-5 min followed by lOg IM (5g in each buttock) Maintenance dose: 5g IM 4lh hourly in the alternate buttock Zuspan or Sihai regimen Loading dose: 4-6g IV over 20 min Maintenance l-2g hourly iv infusion Magnesium sulfate most completely excreted by the kidneys. The therapeutic range of magnesium sulfate is 4-7 meq/lit. At this level, eclamptic fits are almost always controlled Patellar reflex is lost when the s. Mg levels reach 10 meq/lit. At 12 meq/lit. respiratory paralysis and arrest occurs. Antidote for MgSO4 toxicity - Calcium gluconate Ig IV Two important indications for magnesium sulphate therapy: Eclampsia Preterm labour Ref 2- Overview Hypermagnesemia is an uncommon laboratory finding and symptomatic hypermagnesemia is even less common. This disorder has a low incidence of occurrence, because the kidney is able to eliminate excess magnesium by rapidly reducing its tubular reabsorption to almost negligible amounts. In healthy adults, plasma magnesium ranges from 1.7-2.3 mg/dL. Approximately 30% of total plasma magnesium is protein-bound and approximately 70% is filterable through artificial membranes (15% complexed, 55% free Mg2+ ions). With a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of approximately 150 L per day and an ultrafiltrable magnesium concentration of 14 mg/L, the filtered magnesium load is approximately 2,100 mg per day. Normally, only 3% of filtered magnesium appears in urine; thus, 97% is reabsorbed by the renal tubules. In contrast to sodium and calcium, only approximately 25-30% of filtered magnesium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Approximately 60-65% of filtered magnesium is reabsorbed in the thick ascending loop of Henle and 5% is reabsorbed in the distal nephron. Relatively little is known about cellular magnesium transport mechanisms. The most common cause of hypermagnesemia is renal failure. Other causes include the following : Excessive intake Lithium therapy Hypothyroidism Addison disease Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia Milk alkali syndrome Depression Renal Failure Patients with end-stage renal disease often have mild hypermagnesemia, and the ingestion of magnesium-containing medications (eg, antacids, cathartics) can exacerbate the condition. In patients undergoing regular dialysis, the serum magnesium level directly relates to the dialysate magnesium concentration. In patients with acute renal failure, hypermagnesemia usually presents during the oliguric phase; the serum magnesium level returns to normal during the polyuric phase. If a patient receives exogenous magnesium during the oliguric phase, severe hypermagnesemia can result, especially if the patient is acidotic. Other Causes People often take magnesium-containing medications (eg, antacids, laxatives, enemas). Hypermagnesemia can develop after treatment of drug overdoses with magnesium-containing cathartics, and it also occurs in patients taking magnesium-containing medications for therapeutic purposes ; however, most of these patients have normal renal function. With certain gastrointestinal disorders (eg, gastritis, colitis, gastric dilation), increased absorption of magnesium may lead to hypermagnesemia even if the patient does not ingest a large amount of magnesium. In any case, monitoring serum magnesium levels in patients taking magnesium-containing medications is prudent. Suicide attempts using magnesium-containing salt can lead to life-threatening hypermagnesemia, as well. Excessive tissue breakdown (sepsis, shock, large burns), especially with concurrent renal failure, can deliver a large amount of magnesium from the intracellular space, along with a massive elevation of phosphorus and potassium. In the treatment of eclampsia, hypermagnesemia is induced deliberately and sometimes can be symptomatic. Occasionally, hypermagnesemia also can occur in the newborn infant. Maternal magnesium therapy can increase the need for feeding and respiratory support and may cause neurobehavioral disorders in the newborn. Magnesium-containing phosphorus binders are rarely used in end-stage renal disease patients and can lead to elevated magnesium levels. Lithium therapy causes hypermagnesemia by decreasing urinary excretion, although the mechanism for this is not completely clear. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia may cause modest elevations in serum magnesium. This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by very low excretion of calcium and magnesium and by a normal parathyroid hormone level. Abnormalities of calcium and magnesium handling are due to mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor, resulting in increased magnesium reabsorption in the loop of Henle. More recently, mutations of the codon Arg15 (p.R15) in the adaptor-related protein complex 2, s-2 subunit that interacts with the calcium-sensing receptor have been described. Hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, milk-alkali syndrome and theophylline intoxication occasionally produce mild elevations of serum magnesium. There has been some interest in the use of magnesium in the treatment and prevention of cardiac arrhythmias and in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, significant hypermagnesemia has not been reported in these settings. The role of mild elevation of serum magnesium levels in select patient populations is still being defined. In a study examining the prevalence of serum magnesium (Mg) alterations and outcomes in 65,974 hospitalized adult patients, Mg levels of 2.1 mg/dL or higher were found in 20,777 patients (31.5%). An elevated Mg level of 2.3 mg/dL or higher was a predictor of adverse outcomes and associated with worse hospital mortality. In a different study by the same authors, both hypomagnesemia (<1.5 mg/dL) and hypermagnesemia (>2.3 mg/dl) on hospital admission were associated with an increased risk of developing in-hospital acute respiratory failure. the odds ratio (OR) was 1.69 (95% confidence index , 1.19-2.36) with hypomagnesemia and 1.40 (95% CI, 1.02-1.91) with hypermagnesemia. In patients admitted to intensive care units, initial magnesium levels >=2.4 mg/dL (reference: 2.0 to <2.2 mg/dL) was independently associated with increased in mortality (adjusted OR of 1.80; 95% CI: 1.25-2.59. In a large study of 5339 critically ill patients from Switzerland, hypermagnesemia was a strong independent risk factor for 28-day mortality (hazard ratio, 11.6, P<0.001). Similarly, in patients with chronic heart failure, a meta-analysis of 7 prospective studies with a total of 5172 subjects demonstrated that those with baseline hypermagnesemia had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (risk ratio ,, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07-1.78) or all-cause mortality (RR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.18-1.54). On the other hand, in end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis--a population characterized by a particularly high mortality rate--a mild elevation of serum magnesium appeared protective against cardiovascular mortality, albeit without impacting all-cause mortality. Effects of Hypermagnesemia Symptoms of hypermagnesemia usually are not apparent unless the serum magnesium level is greater than 2 mmol/L. Concomitant hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, or uremia exaggerate the symptoms of hypermagnesemia at any given level. Neuromuscular symptoms These are the most common presenting problems. Hypermagnesemia causes blockage of neuromuscular transmission by preventing presynaptic acetylcholine release and by competitively inhibiting calcium influx into the presynaptic nerve channels via the voltage-dependent calcium channel. One of the earliest symptoms of hypermagnesemia is deep-tendon reflex attenuation. Facial paresthesias also may occur at moderate serum levels. Muscle weakness is a more severe manifestation, occurring at levels greater than 5 mmol/L. This manifestation can result in flaccid muscle paralysis and depressed respiration and can eventually progress to apnea. Conduction system symptoms Hypermagnesemia depresses the conduction system of the heart and sympathetic ganglia. A moderate increase in serum magnesium can lead to a mild decrease in blood pressure, and a greater concentration may cause severe symptomatic hypotension. Magnesium is also cardiotoxic and, in high concentrations, can cause bradycardia. Occasionally, complete heart block and cardiac arrest may occur at levels greater than 7 mmol/L. Hypocalcemia Apparently, hypocalcemia can result from a decrease in the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or from end-organ resistance to PTH. In patients with end-stage renal disease, high magnesium levels are associated with relative suppression of PTH, which may, in turn, contribute to hypocalcemia in this population. Paralytic ileus develops from smooth-muscle paralysis, and mothers being treated with magnesium for preterm labor suppression are at risk. Hypermagnesemia may interfere with blood clotting through interference with platelet adhesiveness, thrombin generation time, and clotting time. Nonspecific symptoms These symptoms include the following: Shortness of breath Nausea Vomiting Cutaneous flushing Diagnosis and Summary Hypermagnesemia usually results from a combination of excess magnesium intake and a coexisting impairment of renal function. Diagnosis is usually straightforward and involves measuring serum magnesium levels, as many cases are unsuspected. If a magnesium level is not immediately available, a clue to the existence of hypermagnesemia would be the disease context (preeclampsia, renal failure), the presence of magnesium-containing preparations, or a decreased anion gap. Prevention and Treatment of Hypermagnesemia Prevention of hypermagnesemia is usually possible. Anticipate hypermagnesemia in patients who are receiving magnesium treatment, especially those with reduced renal function. Initially, withdraw magnesium therapy, which often is enough to correct mild to moderate hypermagnesemia. In patients with symptomatic hypermagnesemia that is causing cardiac effects or respiratory distress, antagonize the effects by infusing calcium gluconate. Calcium antagonizes the toxic effect of magnesium, and these ions electrically oppose each other at their sites of action. This treatment usually leads to immediate symptomatic improvement. In subjects with frankly impaired ability to excrete magnesium (eg, end-stage renal disease), renal replacement therapy may also be necessary. Drug Category: Diuretics Agents that promote magnesium excretion are effective in treating hypermagnesemia. Furosemide (Lasix) may promote excretion of magnesium. It increases excretion of water by interfering with the chloride-binding cotransport system, which in turn inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle and distal renal tubule. Drug Category: Calcium salts Calcium may moderate nerve and muscle performance in hypermagnesemia. Calcium gluconate (Kalcinate) directly antagonizes neuromuscular and cardiovascular effects of magnesium. Use in patients with symptomatic hypermagnesemia that is causing cardiac effects or respiratory distress. Drug Category: Antidiabetic agents Agents that shift magnesium ions into cells are helpful in treating hypermagnesemia. Glucose and insulin may help promote magnesium entry into cells. Glucose should be administered with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. Monitor blood sugar levels frequently.",

(Ref: Adam and Victor's Principles of Neurology 8/e p563)Haaga writes- \"The greater sensitivity of MRI for detecting leptomeningeal tumor spread has established this technique as the diagnostic modality of choice for the evaluation of possible leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.\"Harrison writes- \"Leptomeningeal metastases are particularly challenging to diagnose as identification of tumor cells in the subarachnoid compartment may be elusive. MR imaging can be definitive in patients when there are clear tumor nodules adherent to the cauda equina or spinal cord, enhancing cranial nerves, or subarachnoid enhancement on brain imaging. Imaging is diagnostic in approximately 75% of patients and is more often positive in patients with solid tumors. Demonstration of tumor cells in the CSF is definitive and often considered the gold standard. However, CSF cytologic examination is positive in only 50% of patients on the first lumbar puncture and still misses 10% after three CSF samples.\"",

Guanine is always paired with cytosine by the formation of three hydrogen bonds. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) o DNA is the repository of genetic information. DNA is located in nucleus, DNA is also present in mitochondria (but less than 0.1% of the total DNA). Most accepted model for DNA structure is \"Watson and Crick\" model. Which was proposed by Watson and Crick in 1953. We will discuss that here, o DNA is a double-stranded molecule. Each strand is a polymer of nucleotides (deoxyTibonucleotides). Each strand possesses a palority. It has a 31 end and a 51 end. The two strands are antiparalleh i.e. they are parallel but run in opposite directions. o The sugar of DNA is deoxyribose. The purine bases in DNA are adenine (A) and Guanine (G), and pyrimidines are thymine (T) and cytosine (C). Uracil (U), a pyrimidine, is not found in DNA. o Bonds involved in DNA structure are - Within nucleotides: the Glycosidic bond between carbon-1 of the pentose sugar (deoxyribose) and nitrogen-9 of a purine base or nitrogen-1 of the pyrimidine base. Between two strands of DNA: The two chains (strands) are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary pairs of bases. Adenine is always paired with thymine by the formation of two hydrogen bonds and Guanine is always paired with cytosine by the formation of three hydrogen bonds, Between successive nucleotides: Successive nucleotides in a strand of DNA are attached to each other by phosphodiester bonds. Carbon-31 and -51 of deoxyribose subunits are involved in ester linkages with an inorganic phosphate to form a 31, S' phosphodiester bond (a covalent bond). Thus alternating phosphate and deoxyribose units form the backbone structure of DNA while purine and pyrimidine bases are stacked inside. Base-staking interactions: The bases (purines and pyrimidines) lie flat in the interior, stacked on top of one another. They interact with one another through van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions. Collectively these two are known as base-stacking interactions.",

        "exp": "Ans-BREF: William's 22nd ed chapter 32PROGESTERONE ONLY PILLS: So-called mini-pills are oral progestin-only contraceptives that are taken daily. Unlike combined oral contraceptives, they do not reliably inhibit ovulation. Rather, their effectiveness depends more on alterations in cervical mucus and effects on the endometrium.Because the mucus changes do not last longer than 24 hours, mini-pills should be taken at the same time every day to be maximally effective.These contraceptives have not achieved widespread popularity because of a much higher incidence of irregular bleeding and a somewhat higher pregnancy rate than combined contraceptivesBenefitsProgestin-only pills have minimal if any effect on carbohydrate metabolism or coagulation, and they do not cause or exacerbate hypertension.They may be ideal for some women who are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications. This includes women with a history of thrombosis, hypertension, or migraine headaches, or who are older than 35 years of age and who smoke.The mini-pills is often an excellent choice for lactating women. In combination with breastfeeding, it is virtually 100 percent effective for up to 6 months and does not impair milk productionDisadvantagesThe major drawback of progestin-only pills is a contraceptive failure. With these failures, there is a relative increase in the proportion of ectopic pregnancies.Irregular uterine bleeding is most common and another distinct disadvantage and may manifest as amenorrhea, spotting, breakthrough bleeding, or prolonged periods of amenorrhea or menorrhagia.Functional ovarian cysts develop with a greater frequency in women using these agents, although they do not usually necessitate intervention.A distinct disadvantage is that these contraceptives must be taken at the same or nearly the same time dailyFinally, unlike combined oral contraceptives, the mini-pills does not improve acne and may even worsen it in some women. Contraindications:Progestin-only pills are contraindicated in women with unexplained uterine bleeding, especially in older women.",

(a) PCOS Ref : Shaws 15th ed. /115-116, Image- * GARLAND/NECKLACE pattern on USG: PCOS * Comet tail appearance: Adenomyomatosis * Snowstorm appearance: Choriocarcinoma Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), recently referred also as hyperandrogenic anovulation, is a chronic anovulation syndrome associated with androgen excess. The diagnosis is made on the combined clinical, biochemical and sonographic grounds. The revised 2003 ASRM/ESHRE Rotterdam consensus criteria 4 require two of the following three criteria for the diagnosis: oligo- or anovulation hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical) and follicle count on imaging As well as the exclusion of other aetiologies, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing syndrome and/or an androgen-secreting tumour. Subsequently, the Androgen Excess and PCOS society (AE-PCOS) 9 specified a similar set of criteria for diagnosing PCOS but added that PCOS should be seen primarily as a disorder of androgen excess or hyperandrogenism. The criteria set forward was: presence of hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical) ovarian dysfunction (oligo-anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries) exclusion of related disorders Terminology Hyperandrogenic anovulation has been proposed as more accurate and potentially less confusing term, as the ovarian feature is of multiple follicles and not cysts13. At this stage, however, PCOS remains the term that is widely known and used. Epidemiology The estimated prevalence is ~6% (range 4-8%) of women of reproductive age but this varies (up to 20%) depending on the diagnostic criteria used 11. Clinical presentation The classic triad of PCOS is: oligomenorrhea hirsutism obesity In addition to this, patients may have infertility, acne, male pattern balding or biochemically show increased androgen levels. Pathology Markers Luteinizing hormone (LH) is usually increased and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) can be normal or decreased 10. Normally premenopausal LH:FSH is 1:1. In PCOS it may be >2:1 or >3:1. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels are generally increased. Associations subfertility and recurrent pregnancy loss. long-term increased risk of type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease endometrial cancer 6 women with polycystic ovarian morphology are at increased risk of OHSS when undergoing IVF, regardless of whether they have PCOS15 Radiographic features Ultrasound Current recommended sonographic criteria for multifollicular ovarian morphology: 25 or more follicles per ovary (superseding the earlier Rotterdam criteria of 12 or more follicles) 14 increased ovarian size (>10 cc): less sensitive than the follicle number criteria, but has a role when image resolution does not allow accurate follicle count, e.g. transabdominal scanning, older equipment Other morphological features include: hyperechoic central stroma peripheral location of follicles: which can give a string of pearl appearance follicles of similar size measuring 2-9 mm The presence of a single multifollicular ovary is sufficient to provide the sonographic criterion for PCOS2. Ovaries may be normal in PCOS, and conversely, polycystic ovaries may be seen in women without the syndrome. Diagnosis requires correlation with features of hyperandrogenism and oligo-anovulation. MRI MRI is not warranted routinely in the investigation of PCOS, nonetheless pelvic MRI may show most or all of the above sonographic features. Signal characteristics include: T1: small uniform follicles are low in signal while the central stroma is of intermediate signal (vs normal myometrium) T2: follicles have high T2 signal while the central stroma is of comparatively low T2 signal 8 Practical points with a lack of consensus sometimes it is easier to report the number of follicles in each ovary rather than attempt to label the ovaries as \"polycystic\" or \"multifollicular\" History and etymology The syndrome was first described by I.F.

However, amino acid sequencing has uncovered extraordinary variety among restriction enzymes and revealed that at the molecular level there are many more than four different types.\nType I enzymes are complex, multisubunit, combination restriction-andmodification enzymes that cut DNA at random far from their recognition sequences.\nType II enzymes cut DNA at defined positions close to or within their recognition sequences. They produce discrete restriction fragments and distinct gel banding patterns, and they are the only class used in the laboratory for DNA analysis and gene cloning. Rather than forming a single family of related proteins, Type II enzymes are a collection of unrelated proteins of many different sorts. Type II enzymes frequently differ so utterly in amino acid sequence from one another, and indeed from every other known protein, that they exemplify the class of rapidly evolving proteins that are often indicative of involvement in host-parasite interactions. The most common Type II enzymes are those like HhaI, HindIII and NotI that cleave DNA within their recognition sequences. Enzymes of this kind are the principle ones available commercially.. Type III enzymes are also large combination restriction-andmodification enzymes. They cleave outside of their recognition sequences and require two such sequences in opposite orientations within the same DNA molecule to accomplish cleavage; they rarely give complete digests.\nType IV enzymes recognize modified, typically methylated DNA and are exemplified by the McrBC and Mrr systems of E. coli.",

Pheochromocytoma, temporal lobe epilepsy, and hypoglycemia may present as anxiety. In pheochromocytoma, there is an increased secretion of catecholamines which in turn results in overactivity of the sympathetic system. Clinical features are palpitations, sweating, headache, and anxiety. Ultimately blunting of sympathetic activity leads to postural hypotension. In temporal lobe epilepsy, before a seizure attack, the patient may report alteration of mood, memory, complex hallucinations (smell, taste) and emotional changes like sexual arousal and anxiety. In hypoglycemia, there is overactivity of the sympathetic system which leads to increased sweating, trembling, pounding heart, anxiety and hunger.

ANP acts at the kidney to increase sodium excretion, and is secreted in response to blood volume expansion or increased sodium chloride intake. Circulating levels of ANP are increased in congestive heart failure, a condition in which atrial pressure is chronically elevated. The exact mechanisms for the natriuretic effect are not completely known. ANP increases glomerular filtration rate without a sustained increase in renal blood flow, which suggests that the peptide may constrict efferent arterioles. Furthermore, ANP relaxes mesangial cells in the glomeruli, thereby increasing surface area available for filtration. Finally, ANP may directly inhibit sodium reabsorption by renal tubules. The actions of ANP are generally opposite to those of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. ANP inhibits the secretion of renin and aldosterone. ANP produces its effects by increasing intracellular formation of cGMP. The ANP receptor has a cytoplasmic domain with guanylyl cyclase activity, which is increased by hormone-receptor binding.",

        "exp": "Ans. is CEpiphysial fractures are more common than ligamentous injuries in children since the ligaments of the joints are generally stronger than their associated growth plates. Fractures across the growth plate may produce bony bridges that will cause premature cessation of growth or angular deformities of the extremity. These bridges are due to the trauma to the growth plate and can occur even with adequate reductions.Epiphysial fractures around the shoulder, wrist, and fingers can usually be treated by closed reduction, but fractures of the epiphyses around the elbow often require open reduction. In the lower extremity, accurate reduction of the epiphysial plate is necessary to prevent joint deformity when a joint surface is involved. If angular deformities result, corrective osteotomy may be necessary.Reference: Erickson M.A., Merritt C., Polousky J.D. (2012). Chapter 26. Orthopedics. In W.W. Hay, Jr., M.J. Levin, R.R.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Pancreatic divisum Ref - Pancreas divisum represents a variation in pancreatic ductal anatomy that can be associated with abdominal pain and idiopathic pancreatitis. It is characterised, in the majority of cases, by the dorsal pancreatic duct (main pancreatic and Santorini ducts) directly entering the minor papilla with no communication with the ventral duct (Wirsung), and thus, the major papilla. Epidemiology It is the most common variation of pancreatic duct formation and may be present in ~4-10 % of the general population 3-4,6. Its MRCP prevalence is at around 9% with autopsy prevalence going up to 14% 7. Clinical presentation Most people with a pancreas divisum are asymptomatic, but this is more frequently found in patients with chronic abdominal pain and idiopathic pancreatitis than in the general population 4. Pathology It results from failure of fusion of dorsal and ventral pancreatic anlages. As a result, the dorsal pancreatic duct drains most of the pancreatic glandular parenchyma via the minor papilla. Although controversial, this variant is considered as a cause of pancreatitis. Pancreatic divisum can result in a santorinicoele, which is a cystic dilatation of the distal dorsal duct (Santorini duct), immediately proximal to the minor papilla. Three subtypes are known: type 1 (classic): no connection at all; occurs in the majority of cases: 70% type 2 (absent ventral duct): minor papilla drains all of pancreas while major papilla drains bile duct; 20-25% type 3 (functional): filamentous or inadequate connection between dorsal and ventral ducts: 5-6% Radiographic features Fluoroscopy: ERCP This was the traditional method of diagnosis where a pancreas divisum was suspected when there was no contrast extending towards the pancreatic tail upon administration at the ampulla of Vater. MRCP/MRI pancreas It is the current gold standard method of evaluation. The key imaging features: the dorsal pancreatic duct being in direct continuity with the duct of Santorini, which drains into the minor ampulla ventral duct (Wirsung duct), which does not communicate with the dorsal duct but joins with the distal bile duct to enter the major ampulla Some authors suggest increased sensitivity of secretin MRCP (S-MRCP) in detection sensitivity of pancreas divisum 2. Treatment and prognosis A diagnosis of pancreas divisum does not routinely warrant treatment, especially when incidental and asymptomatic. In symptomatic patients (e.g. recurrent pancreatitis), management options may include 6: non-operative treatment +/- pancreatic enzyme supplements minor papillectomy minor papilla stenting balloon dilatation of any associated stricture",

It is expressed through transcription to RNA (tRNA, mRNA & rRNA). Subsequently, it is translated into polypeptide chain i.e. protein synthesis.Steps of protein synthesisActivation of amino acids.InitiationElongationTerminationWe are not going into detailed steps, as it is a vast topic, so let's discuss the options one by one.Methionine having anticodon UAC is the first amino acid required in binding to the initiation codon AUG on m- RNA. In bacteria and in mitochondria the initiator t-RNA carries an N-formyl ated methionine but in eukaryotes the methionine is not formyl ated so ans. is (a).Recognition of a particular codon in an mRNA sequence is accomplished by the anticodon sequence of the tRNA and it follows the rules of complimentary and antiparallel binding, that is, the mRNA codon is read 5' - 3' by an anticodon pairing in the \"flipped\" (-5') orientation (when writing the sequences of both codons and anticodons, the nucleotide sequence must always be listed in the 5' - 3' order).During elongation of the polypeptide chain, the ribosome moves from the 5' end to the 3' end of the m-RNA that is being translated. This process is facilitated by elongation factors (EF-2) & requires GTP. EF-2 GTP complex is hydrolyzed to EF-2-GDP & the energy released moves the m-RNA forward by one codon.The initiation of protein synthesis starts with dissociation of 80S ribosome into 60S & 40S followed by formation of 43 S Pre initiation complex, which binds to cap structure at the 5'end of m-RNA (present in all eukaryotic cells) & moves down the mRNA until it encounters the initiator codon. But in prokaryotes there is a purine rich sequence of nucleotide bases known as the Shine - Dalgarno sequence of m-RNA. This sequence binds with complimentary sequence near 3'end of 16S r-RNA component of 30S ribosomal subunit.Other important differences in prokaryotes & eukaryotes regarding protein synthesis are:Prokaryotic mRNAs are polycistronic i.e. with several coding regions with its own initiation codon. It can produce separate species of polypeptide while eukaryotic mRNA is monocistronic i.e. codes for only one polypeptide chain.The releasing factors utilized in termination are 3 in prokaryotes RF-1, RJF-2 & RF-3 while in eukaryotes it is only one- eRF.In prokaryotes three initiation factors are known (IF-1, IF-2 & IF-3) whereas in eukaryotes there are at least 10 (designated as- elF)",

Each hair cell has 50-70 small cilia called stereocilia and a large cilium called the kinocilium. The kinocilium is always located to one side and the stereocilia become progressively shorter toward the other side of the cell. Minute filamentous attachments almost invisible even to the electron microscope connect the tip of each stereocilium to the next longer stereocilium and finally to the kinocilium Because of these attachments, when the stereocilia and kinocilium bend in the direction of the kinocilium, the filamentous attachments tug in sequence on the stereocilia pulling them outward from the cell body. This opens hundreds of fluid channels in the neuronal cell membrane around the bases of the stereocilia and these channels are capable of conducting large amounts of positive ions. The positive ions pour into the cell from the surrounding endolymphatic fluid causing receptor membrane depolarization. Conversely bending of the stereocilia in the opposite direction can cause receptor hyperpolarization.",

        "exp": "Ans: C (Ca esophagus) Explanation:Ref- Oesophageal carcinoma is relatively uncommon. It tends to present with increasing dysphagia, initially to solids and progressing to liquids as the tumour increases in size, obstructing the lumen of the oesophagus. Epidemiology Oesophageal cancer is responsible for <1% of all cancers and 4-10% of all GI malignancies. There is recognised male preponderance with the squamous cell subtype, M:F 4:1. Blacks are more susceptible than caucasians, 2:1. The incidence of the subtypes has regional variation. The squamous cell subtype has the greatest worldwide incidence (~90%), but the adenocarcinoma subtype is more common in many parts of North America and Europe. In addition, there are certain regions where individuals are at particularly high risk of developing oesophageal cancer, e.g. Iran, parts of Africa, Italy and China. Predisposing factors include 8: alcohol and smoking: for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma achalasia asbestosis Barrett oesophagus: for adenocarcinoma coeliac disease ionising radiation caustic stricture/lye stricture Plummer-Vinson syndrome obesity: for adenocarcinoma history of oral or pharyngeal cancer human papilloma virus (HPV) tylosis (Howel-Evans syndrome): rare AD disease with hyperkeratosis of palm and sole with a high incidence of oesophageal cancer Clinical presentation Patients present with progressive dysphagia, weight loss, chronic worsening gastroesophageal reflux and hoarseness, cough, vocal cord paralysis, or other signs and symptoms of mediastinal invasion. Pathology Histological types squamous cell carcinoma of oesophagus: 81-95% (worldwide) adenocarcinoma of oesophagus: 4-19% (worldwide) arising from mucosal/submucosal glands, heterotopic gastric mucosa, or columnar-lined epithelium >90% related to Barrett oesophagus tend to occur at the gastro-oesophageal junction other types mucoepidermoid carcinoma adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) spindle-cell squamous carcinoma leiomyosarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma fibrosarcoma malignant lymphoma * in western world adenocarcinoma is as common or even slightly more common than SCC Macroscopic appearance polypoid/fungating (most common) sessile/pedunculated tumour lobulated surface protruding irregular, polycyclic, overhanging, step-like \"apple core\" lesion ulcerating: large ulcer niche within bulging mass infiltrating: gradual narrowing with a smooth transition superficial spreading carcinoma Staging See main article: oesophageal cancer staging. Metastases lymphatic anterior jugular chain and supraclavicular nodes (primary in upper 1/3) para-oesophageal and subdiaphragmatic nodes (primary in middle 1/3) mediastinal and paracardial and coeliac trunk nodes (primary in lower 1/3) haematogenous: lung, liver, adrenal glands Radiographic features A combination of CT scan, transoesophageal ultrasound and PET/CT scan are used for staging of the disease. CT is the best initial modality for detection of the distant metastasis, gross direct invasion, and enlarged lymph nodes. Ultrasound is the most sensitive modality for assessment of the depth of invasion and regional enlarged lymph nodes. PET can be useful for re-staging after the initial neoadjuvant therapy 7. Chest radiograph Many indirect signs can be sought on a chest radiograph and these include: widened azygo-oesophageal recess with convexity toward right lung (in 30% of distal and mid-oesophageal cancers) thickening of posterior tracheal stripe and right paratracheal stripe >4 mm (if tumour located in the upper third of oesophagus) tracheal deviation or posterior tracheal indentation/mass retrocardiac or posterior mediastinal mass oesophageal air-fluid level lobulated mass extending into gastric bubble (Kirklin sign) repeated aspiration pneumonia (with tracheo-oesophageal fistula) Fluoroscopy/Barium Swallow irregular stricture pre-stricture dilatation with 'hold up' shouldering of the stricture Endoscopic US It is the most accurate imaging modality for the T staging of oesophageal cancer It defines the layers of the oesophageal wall hence can differentiate T1, T2, and T3 tumors The oesophagus consists of five layers. the first hyperechoic layer represents the interface between the balloon and the superficial mucosa. the second hypoechoic layer represents the lamina propria and muscularis mucosae. the third hyperechoic layer represents the submucosa the fourth hypoechoic layer represents the muscularis propria the fifth layer represents the interface between the adventitia and surrounding tissues CT eccentric or circumferential wall thickening >5 mm peri-oesophageal soft tissue and fat stranding dilated fluid- and debris-filled oesophageal lumen is proximal to an obstructing lesion tracheobronchial invasion appears as a displacement of the airway (usually the trachea or left mainstem bronchus) as a result of mass effect by the oesophageal tumour aortic invasion FDG PET/CT PET/CT is useful for detecting oesophageal primary tumors yet it has little role in helping determine the specific T classification because it provides limited information about the depth of tumor invasion. PET/CT is also superior to CT for detecting lymph node metastases and can depict metastases in normal-sized lymph nodes through the uptake of FDG. PET/CT has a primary role in the depiction of distant sites of metastatic disease. The most common sites of distant metastases detected at PET (but frequently missed at CT) are the bones and liver. Complications fistula formation to trachea (5-10%), bronchi or mediastinum: can be either due to direct tumour progression or iatrogenic effects (e.g. radiation therapy) oesophageal perforation Treatment and prognosis The 5-year mortality depends on the stage of the tumour. Unfortunately, most cases present with regional or distant metastatic disease (30% and 40%, respectively. localised disease: ~40% 5-year survival distant metastatic disease: ~5% 5-year survival Endoscopic mucosal resection, without or with localised ablation is an option for localised (T1a) disease. These epithelial tumours are usually <2 cm, asymptomatic, and noncircumferential. For T1b tumours and above, surgical options are mostly limited to oesophagectomy (including sometimes with palliative colonic interposition (see case 19)) Differential diagnosis Imaging differential considerations include: benign tumours of oesophagus oesophageal leiomyoma oesophageal leiomyomatosis non-malignant conditions (e.g. diffuse inflammation) X-Ray Findings - Abdomen (Contrast) A.

        "exp": "Ans. A. Osteogenesis imperfecta. (Ref. H - 17th/pg. 2411)Blue sclera is a distinct feature of OGLSCLEROSING BONE DISORDERS# OSTEOPETROSIS# PYKNODYSOSTOSIS# PROGRESSIVE DIAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA (Camurati-Engelman disease)# HYPEROSTOSIS CORTICALIS GENERALISATA (van Buchem disease)# MELORHEOSTOSIS (Greek, \"flowing hyperostosis\")# OSTEOPOIKILOSIS (\"spotted bones\")# Hepatitis C-associated osteosclerosis (HCAO)Pyknodysostosis :# Pyknodysostosis is a form of short-limb dwarfism that presents with frequent fractures but usually normal lifespan. Clinical features include short stature; kyphoscoliosis and deformities of the chest; high arched palate; proptosis; blue sclerae; dysmorphic features including small face and chin, frontooccipital prominence, pointed beaked nose, large cranium, and obtuse mandibular angle; and small square hands with hypoplastic nails. Radiographs demonstrate a generalized increase in bone density, but in contrast to osteopetrosis, the long bones are normally shaped. Separated cranial sutures, including the persistent patency of the anterior fontanel, are characteristic of the disorder. There may also be hypoplasia of the sinuses, mandible, distal clavicles, and terminal phalanges. Persistence of deciduous teeth and sclerosis of the calvarium and base of the skull are also common.Anchondo dysplasia:# This is a relatively common form of short-limb dwarfism that occurs in 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 40,000 live births. The disease is caused by a mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that results in a gain-of-function state. Most cases are sporadic mutations. However, when the disorder appears in families, the inheritance pattern is consistent with an autosomal dominant disorder. The primary defect is abnormal chondrocyte proliferation at the growth plate that causes the development of short but proportionately thick long bones. Other regions of the long bones may be relatively unaffected. The disorder is manifest by the presence of short limbs (particularly the proximal portions), normal trunk, large head, saddle nose, and an exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Severe spinal deformity may lead to cord compression. The homozygous disorder is more serious than the sporadic form and may cause neonatal death. Pseudo-achondroplasia clinically resembles achondroplasia but has no skull abnormalities.Osteopetrosis (marble bone disease):# Osteopetrosis refers to a group of disorders caused by severe impairment of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. There is the solid x-ray appearance of the involved skeleton, o Diaphyses and metaphyses are broadened, and alternating sclerotic and lucent bands may be seen in the iliac crests, at the ends of long bones, and in vertebral bodies. The cranium is usually thickened, particularly at the base of the skull, and the paranasal and mastoid sinuses are under pneumatized. Albers-Schonberg disease refers to the milder, adult form of osteopetrosis (autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II). Mice deficient in RANK lack osteoclasts and develop severe osteopetrosis. As bone and cartilage fail to undergo modeling, paralysis of one or more cranial nerves may occur due to narrowing of the cranial foramina. Failure of skeletal modeling also results in inadequate marrow space, leading to extramedullary hematopoiesis with hypersplenism and pancytopenia. Hypocalcemia due to lack of osteoclastic bone resorption may occur in infants and young children. The untreated infantile disease is fatal, often before age 5. The course is not always benign, as fractures may be accompanied by blue sclerae, loss of vision, deafness, psychomotor delay, mandibular osteomyelitis, and other complications usually associated with the juvenile form. /gjt: Allogenic HLA-identical bone marrow transplantation has been successful in some children. Following transplantation, the marrow contains progenitor cells and normally functioning osteoclasts. A cure is most likely when children are transplanted before age 4.",

Thrombin activates FXl, FVIH, and FV, amplifying the coagulation signal. Once the TF/FVUa/FXa complex is formed, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibits the TF/FVlla pathway, making coagulation dependent on the amplification loop through FIXfFVlll. Coagulation requires calcium (not shown) and takes place on phospholipid surfaces, usually the activated platelet membraneAlso Remember:The major components of the hemostatic system, which function in concert, are (1) platelets and other formed elements of blood, such as monocytes and red cells; (2) plasma proteins (the coagulation and fibrinolytic factors and inhibitors); and (3) the vessel wall itself.# On vascular injury, platelets adhere to the site of injury, usually the denuded vascular intimal surfacePlatelet adhesion'-' results in subsequent platelet activation and aggregationDuring platelet aggregation (platelet-platelet interaction), additional platelets are recruited from the circulation to the site of vascular injury, leading to the formation of an occlusive platelet thrombus.# The platelet plug is anchored and stabilized by the developing fibrin mesh. # The immediate trigger for coagulation is vascular damage that exposes blood to TF that is constitutively expressed on the surfaces of subendothelial cellular components of the vessel wall",

Its physiologic function is to selectively suppress pituitaty release of FSH.

Luteinizing hormone (LH) is suppressed by testosterone of Leydig cell origin.

        "exp": "Crossover occurs during the pachytene stage of meiosis. Meiosis is the mechanism used by the reproductive organs to generate gametes-cells with the haploid number of chromosomes. DNA synthesis occurs before meiotic prophase begins and is followed by a G2 phase. Cells then enter meiotic prophase I. During meiotic prophase I, maternal and paternal' chromosomes are precisely paired, and recombination occurs in each pair of homologous chromosomes. The first meiotic prophase consists of five substages: leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene, and diakinesis. During metaphase I, there is random segregation of maternal and paternal chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes are aligned on the metaphase plate of the meiotic spindle in metaphase I. The second meiotic division is responsible for the reduction in the chromosome content of the cell by 50%. In meiotic division II, metaphase consists of daughter chromatids of single homologous chromosomes aligned on a metaphase plate (metaphase II). Condensation of the chromatids occurs in leptotene. In zygotene, the synaptonemal complex begins to form, which initiates the close association between chromosomes known as synapsis. The bivalent is formed between the two sets of homologous chromosomes (one set maternal and one set paternal equals a pair of maternal chromatids and a pair of paternal chromatids). The four chromatids form a tetrad (bivalent). Pachytene begins as soon as the synapsis is complete and includes the period of crossover. The fully formed synaptonemal complex is present during the pachytene stage. At each point where crossover has occurred between two chromatids of the homologous chromosomes, an attachment point known as a chiasma forms. The formation of chiasmata and de synapsing (separation of the axes of the synaptonemal complex) occurs in the diplotene stage. Diakinesis is an intermediate phase between diplotene and metaphase of the first meiotic division.",

Sabiston, Bailey and Schwartz Explanation Both Spleen and Liver are the most common organs to be injured in blunt injury abdomen. \"The spleen is the most commonly injured abdominal organ in the NTDB (National Trauma Database), with 3.2% of all injured patients and 50.7% of patients with blunt abdominal trauma demonstrating splenic injuries.\" Sabiston Pg 457 \"Second only to the spleen, injury to the liver is extremely common after blunt abdominal trauma.\" Sabiston Pg 459. \"The most commonly injured organs are the spleenr liver retroperiioneum, small bowel kidneys, bladder cobrectum, diaphragm, and pancreas.\" (Ref: Medscape emedicine) Liver followed by the spleen were the most common sites of injuries.(Ref: Shah et at.) Spleen is the most common damaged organ in blunt abdominal trauma. (Ref: Schwartz) * Liver injuries are fortunate!'/ uncommon because of the livers position under the diaphragm protected by the chest wall.

Crushing External compression, Signs and Symptoms The initial clinical assessment of patients with blunt abdominal trauma is often difficult and notably inaccurate. The most reliable signs and symptoms in alert patients are as follows: Pain. Tenderness. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Hypovolemia. Evidence of peritoneal irritation. Bradycardia may indicate the presence of free intraperitoneal blood. On physical examination, the following injury patterns predict the potential for intra-abdominal trauma: Lap belt marks: Correlate with small intestine rupture. Steering wheel-shaped contusions. Ecchymosis involving the flanks [Grey Turner sign} or the umbilicus [Cullen sign): Indicates retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Abdominal distention. Auscultation of bowel sounds in the thorax -- Diaphragmatic injury. Abdominal bruit: Underlying vascular disease or traumatic arteriovenous fistula. Local or generalized tenderness, guarding, rigidity or rebound tenderness: Peritoneal injury. Fullness and doughy consistency on palpation: Intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Crepitation or instability of the tower thoracic cage: Indicates the potential for splenic or hepatic injuries. Diagnosis Assessment of hemodynamic stability. In the hemodynamically unstable patient, a rapid evaluation for hemoperitoneum can be accomplished by means of diagnostic peritoneal lavage [DPL) or the focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST). Radiographic studies of the abdomen are indicated in stable patients when the physical examination findings are inconclusive. FAST Bedside ultrasonography is a rapid, portable, noninvasive, and accurate examination that can be performed by emergency clinicians and trauma surgeons to detect hemoperitoneum. The current FAST examination protocol consists of 4 acoustic windows (pericardiac perihepatic, perisplenic, pelvic) with the patient supine. An examination is interpreted as: o Positive if free fluid is found in any of the 4 acoustic windows. o Negative if no fluid is seen. o Indeterminate if any of the windows cannot be adequately assessed. Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage DPL is indicated for the following patients in the setting of blunt trauma: DPL is done when FAST is not available. Patients with potential intra-abdominal injury who will undergo prolonged anesthesia for another procedure. Computed Tomography Computed tomography is the standard for detecting solid organ injuries. Provide excellent imaging of the pancreas, duodenum and genitourinary system. Also can determine the source of hemorrhage. Management Treatment of blunt abdominal trauma begins at the scene of the injury and is continued upon the patient's arrival at hospital. Management may involve nonoperative measures or surgical treatment as appropriate. Indications for Laparotomy Signs of peritonitis. Uncontrolled shock or hemorrhage. Clinical deterioration during observation. Hemoperitoneum findings on FAST or DPL in a hemodynamically unstable patient. Nonoperative Management in blunt abdominal trauma, including severe solid organ injuries, selective nonoperative management has become the standard of care. Nonoperative management strategies are based on CT scan diagnosis and the hemodynamic stability of the patient, as follows: o Pediatric patients can be resuscitated and treated nonoperatively. o Hemodynamically stable adults with solid organ injuries (liver and spleen). o Splenic artery embolotherapy, may be used for adult blunt splenic injury.",

Page. 179\nUmblical Cord: \n\nThe umbilical cord forms around the fifth week of pregnancy and can grow up to 20 inches long at full-term.\nHas\u00a0two main layers: an outer layer of smooth muscle, and an inner layer containing a gelatinous fluid called\u00a0Wharton's jelly.\nVasculature - one vein and two arteries. The vein carries oxygen and nutrient-rich blood from the placenta to the fetus, and the arteries carry deoxygenated and nutrient-depleted blood away from the fetus.\n\nClinical Anatomy:\n\nSingle umbilical artery: Related to congenital anamolies including problems with the heart, nervous system, chromosomes and urinary tract. This problem can be detected before birth.\nUmbilical cord prolapse: Umbilical cord may prolapse, or slip into the birth canal, and become compressed during delivery, which can cut off the baby's blood supply\nUmbilical cord knots: It is not uncommon for the cord to become wrapped around the baby's neck, but this rarely causes serious problems.\nUmbilical cord cysts: Sometimes cysts can be seen developing on the umbilical cord via ultrasound. This can lead to abnormalities in the kidneys, chromosomes and abdomen.\nVasa previa: In rare cases, umbilical cord blood vessels may shift outside of the protection of the cord and move underneath the baby. This can lead to tears in the vessels and life-threatening bleeding. Pregnant women who experience bleeding in the second or third trimester should seek medical attention to rule out this complication.",

        "exp": "A child with a constellation of findings including fever, disabling arthritis, rash, and blindness is most likely suffering from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). JRA is characterized by a chronic synovial inflamma\u00adtion of unknown origin; it most commonly affects the knees, but can also manifest in wrists, ankles, and the atlanto-axial joint in the neck. In general, JRA is more common in girls than boys, but this varies with the type of JRA, which can be divided into the following variant subsets: Still disease (20%), polyarticular (40%), and pauciarticular (40%). Still disease most closely resembles an infectious disease, with spiking fever, a centripetal rash, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, transient arthralgias and ar\u00adthritis, and effusions (pericardial and pleural). The polyarticular variant is associated with destructive ar\u00adthritis, particularly if the patient tests positive for the rheumatoid factor. The pauciarticular variant features polyarthritis and inflammation of the anterior uveal tract 10%-50%), which predisposes the patient to visual loss and blindness. In most cases of JRA, with the exception of the polyarticular variant, the rheumatoid factor is negative. Anemia and leukocytosis are noted in acute attacks. Aspirin is the major anti-inflamma\u00adtory agent that is used for treatment. Regarding the other choices in the question:\n\nrheumatic fever features polyarthritis, but it is not destructive\nLyme disease displays many of these findings, but blindness is not a key feature\nHenoch-Schoenlein vasculitis has palpable purpura, non-disabling arthritis, but is not associated with blindness\ndermatomyositis does not usually involve the joints",

Because transparency is of prime importance the cornea does not have blood vessels; it receives nutrients via diffusion from the tear fluid through the outside surface and the aqueous humour through the inside surface, and also from neurotrophins supplied by nerve fibres that innervate it. In humans, the cornea has a diameter of about 11.5 mm and a thickness of 0.5-0.6 mm in the center and 0.6-0.8 mm at the periphery. Transparency, avascularity, the presence of immature resident immune cells, and immunologic privilege makes the cornea a very special tissue.

The only indication for fibrinolysis in pulmonary embolus (PE) is for massive PE presenting with life-threatening hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and refractory hypoxemia.\nIn submassive PE presenting with preserved blood pressure and evidence of right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram, the decision to pursue fibrinolysis is made on a case-by-case situation. In addition to fibrinolysis, the patient should also receive circulatory support with vasopressors.\nDopamine and dobutamine are the vasopressors of choice for the treatment of shock in PE. Caution should be taken with ongoing high-volume fluid administration as a poorly functioning right ventricle may be poorly tolerant of additional fluids.\nOngoing fluids may worsen right ventricular ischemia and further dilate the right ventricle, displacing the interventricular septum to the left to worsen cardiac output and hypotension. If the patient had contraindications to fibrinolysis and was unable to be stabilized with vasopressor support, referral for surgical embolectomy should be considered.\nReferral for inferior vena cava filter placement is not indicated at this time.

        "question": "Type of sampling shown in Figure is",
        "exp": "Ans- A Simple random sampling Ref - Review: Simple Random Sampling Do you remember how simple random sampling works? Visually, it's just numbering each individual and randomly selecting a certain number of them. Here's the image we used in the previous section: Stratified Sampling Stratified sampling is different. With this technique, we separate the population using some characteristic, and then take a proportional random sample from each. A stratified sample is obtained by separating the population into non-overlapping groups called strata and then obtaining a proportional simple random sample from each group. The individuals within each group should be similar in some way. Visually, it might look something like the image below. With our population, we can easily separate the individuals by color. Once we have the strata determined, we need to decide how many individuals to select from each stratum. (Man, that's a weird word!) The key here is that the number selected should be proportional. In our case, 1/4 of the individuals in the population are blue, so 1/4 of the sample should be blue as well. Working things out, we can see that a stratified (by color) random sample of 4 should have 1 blue, 1 green, and 2 reds. Example 1 One easy example using a stratified technique would be a sampling of people at ECC. To make sure that a sufficient number of students, faculty, and staff are selected, we would stratify all individuals by their status - students, faculty, or staff. (These are the strata.) Then, a proportional number of individuals would be selected from each group. Systematic Sampling A systematic sample is obtained by selecting every kth individual from the population. The first individual selected corresponds to a random number between 1 and k. So to use systematic sampling, we need to first order our individuals, then select every kth. (More on how to select k in a bit.) In our example, we want to use 3 for k? Can you see why? Think what would happen if we used 2 or 4. For our starting point, we pick a random number between 1 and k. For our visual, let's suppose that we pick 2. The individuals sampled would then be 2, 5, 8, and 11. In general we find k by taking N/n and rounding down to the nearest integer. For another take, watch this YouTube video: Example 2 Systematic sampling works well when the individuals are already lined up in order. In the past, students have often used this method when asked to survey a random sample of ECC students. Since we don't have access to the complete list, just stand at a corner and pick every 10th* person walking by. * Of course, choosing 10 here is just an example. It would depend on the number of students typically passing by that spot and what sample size was needed. Cluster Sampling Cluster sampling is often confused with stratified sampling, because they both involve \"groups\". In reality, they're very different. In stratified sampling, we split the population up into groups (strata) based on some characteristic. A cluster sample is obtained by selecting all individuals within a randomly selected collection or group of individuals. In essence, we use cluster sampling when our population is already broken up into groups (clusters), and each cluster represents the population. That way, we just select a certain number of clusters. With our visual, let's suppose the 12 individuals are paired up just as they were sitting in the original population. Since we want a random sample of size four, we just select two of the clusters. We would number the clusters 1-6 and use technology to randomly select two random numbers. It might look something like this: Example 3 One situation where cluster sampling would apply might be in manufacturing. Suppose your company makes light bulbs, and you'd like to test the effectiveness of the packaging. You don't have a complete list, so simple random sampling doesn't apply, and the bulbs are already in boxes, so you can't order them to use systematic. And all the bulbs are essentially the same, so there aren't any characteristics with which to stratify them. To use cluster sampling, a quality control inspector might select a certain number of entire boxes of bulbs and test each bulb within those boxes. In this case, the boxes are the clusters. Convenience Sampling Other methods do exist for finding samples of populations. In fact, you've seen some already. Probably the most common is the so-called convenience sample. Convenience samples are just what they sound like - convenient. Unfortunately, they're rarely representative. Think of the radio call-in show, those people in the shopping malls trying to survey you about your purchasing habits, or even the voting on American Idol! Here's a specific example. It's a poll on beliefnet.com, titled \"What Evangelicals Want\". All online polls use, by nature, convenience sampling. According to the article, \"The poll was promoted on Beliefnet's web site and through its newsletters.\" Only those evangelicals who visit this particular web site and actually answer the survey are included. Beware any poll result taken with convenience sampling. Multistage Sampling Often one technique isn't possible, so many professional polling agencies use a technique called multistage sampling. The strategy is relatively self-explanatory - two or more sampling techniques are used. For example, consider the light-bulb example we looked at earlier with cluster sampling. Let's suppose that the bulbs come off the assembly line in boxes that each contain 20 packages of four bulbs each. One strategy would be to do the sample in two stages: Stage 1: A quality control engineer removes every 200th box coming off the line. (The plant produces 5,000 boxes daily. (This is systematic sampling.) Stage 2: From each box, the engineer then samples three packages to inspect. (This is an example of cluster sampling.) The US Census also uses multistage sampling. If you haven't already (you should have!), read Section 1.4 in your text for more details.

FISH * The above-mentioned site writes about FISH- * \"FISH can be used in interphase cells to determine the chromosome number of one or more chromosomes as well as to detect some specific chromosome rearrangements that are characteristic for certain cancers. The primary advantage of interphase FISH is that it can be performed very rapidly if necessary, usually within 24 hours, because cell growth is not required.* A good example is the Aneuploid Screen test which is performed on amniotic fluid cells when there is a strong clinical indication for one of the common trisomies. The sample nuclei are denatured and hybridized with DNA probes for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y and results usually obtained within 24 hours. Routine Cytogenetics is included with an Aneuploid Screen to confirm the results or detect any abnormalities not detected by interphase FISH.\"Fluorescent IN SITU Hybridization (FISH)Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a relatively new technology utilizing fluorescently labeled DNA probes to detect or confirm gene or chromosome abnormalities that are generally beyond the resolution of routine cytogenetics. The sample DNA (metaphase chromosomes or interphase nuclei) is first denatured, a process that separates the complementary strands within the DNA double helix structure. The fluorescently labeled probe of interest is then added to the denatured sample mixture and hybridizes with the sample DNA at the target site as it reanneals (or reforms itself) back into a double helix. The probe signal can then be seen through a fluorescent microscope and the sample DNA scored for the presence or absence of the signal.FISH can be used in metaphase cells to detect specific microdeletions beyond the resolution of routine cytogenetics or identify the extra material of unknown origin. It can also help in cases where it is difficult to determine from routine cytogenetics if a chromosome has a simple deletion or is involved in a subtle or complex rearrangement. In addition, metaphase FISH can detect some of the specific chromosome rearrangements seen in certain cancers.Microdeletion Syndromes Currently Diagnosable with FISHCri-du-Chat * Kallman SyndromeMiller-Dieker Syndrome * Williams SyndromeSmith-Magenis Syndrome * Wolf-HirschhornSteroid Sulfatase Deficiency * Prader-Willi/Angelman SyndromeDiGeorge/Velo-Cardio-Facial/CATCH-*22/Shprintzen SyndromeSingle-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP)SSCP is the electrophoretic separation of single-stranded nucleic acids based on subtle differences in sequence (often a single base pair) which results in a different secondary structure and a measurable difference in mobility through a gel.The mobility of double-stranded DNA in gel electrophoresis is dependent on strand size and length but is relatively independent of the particular nucleotide sequence. The mobility of single strands, however, is noticeably affected by very small changes in sequence, possibly one changed nucleotide out of several hundred. Small changes are noticeable because of the relatively unstable nature of single-stranded DNA; in the absence of a complementary strand, the single strand may experience intrastrand base pairing, resulting in loops and folds that give the single strand a unique 3D structure, regardless of its length. A single nucleotide change could dramatically affect the strand's mobility through a gel by altering the intrastrand base pairing and its resulting 3D conformation (Melcher, 2000).Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis takes advantage of this quality of single-stranded DNA. SSCP analysis offers an inexpensive, convenient, and sensitive method for determining genetic variationThe SSCP analysis method detects point mutations by analyzing their unique electrophoretic mobility that results from small changes in the variant's nucleotide sequences.Polymerase chain reaction is a sensitive and rapid method for amplifying a specific DNA sequence.",

The appendiceal wall becomes thinned and lymphatic and venous obstruction occurs. Necrosis and perforation develop when the arterial flow is compromised. Diagnosis. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is made by clinical evaluation. Although laboratory tests and imaging procedures can be helpful, they are of secondary importance. Clinical presentation Symptoms Progressive, persistent midabdominal discomfort caused by obstruction and distention of the appendix, which stimulates the visceral afferent autonomic nerves (T8-10 distribution). Anorexia (90%) and a low-grade fever (<38.5degC). Nausea and vomiting (70%) and 10% have diarrhea. Once the inflammation extends transmurally to the parietal peritoneum, the somatic pain fibers are stimulated, and the pain localizes to the RLQ. Peritoneal irritation is associated with pain on movement, mild fever, and tachycardia. One-fourth of patients present initially with localized pain and no prior visceral symptoms. The onset of symptoms to the time of presentation is usually less than 24 hours for acute appendicitis and averages several hours. In Children, if the diagnosis is delayed beyond 36-48 hr. the perforation rate exceeds 65%. Perforation is most common in young children, with rates as high as 82% for children <5 vr and approaching 100% in infants. Nausea and vomiting occur in more than half the patients and usually follow the onset of abdominal pain by several hours. Physical examination McBurney's point tenderness two-thirds of the distance from the umbilicus to the anterosuperior iliac spine). Localized abdominal tenderness is the single most reliable finding in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The presence of pain in the RLQ during gentle finger percussion in the LL.Q (Rovsing's sign) indicates peritoneal irritation. The degree of direct tenderness is appreciated. The degree of muscular resistance to palpation parallels the severity of the inflammatory process. Cutaneous hyperesthesia is often present overlying the region of maximal tenderness. Exacerbation of pain with passive stretching of the iliopsoas muscle (positive psoas sign) implies the presence of local inflammation in the area of the muscle (e.g.. retrocecal appendicitis). A pelvic appendix may produce hypogastric pain with passive internal rotation, a positive Obturator sign. A palpable mass in the RLQ suggests a peri-appendiceal abscess or phlegmon. Laboratory evaluation. Complete blood cell count, serum electrolytes, and urinalysis should be obtained preoperatively for patients with suspected appendicitis. A serum pregnancy test also must be performed for all ovulating women. Complete blood cell count A leukocyte count of greater than 10,000 cells/ mL with polymorphonuclear cell predominance (>75%) is common in the child and young adult with appendicitis. The total number of WBCs and the proportion of immature forms increase if there is an appendiceal perforation. Urinalysis It is abnormal in 25-40% of patients with appendicitis. Pyuria, albuminuria, and hematuria are common. Radiologic evaluation USG is most useful Findings associated with acute appendicitis include The appendiceal diameter of greater than 6 mm. Lack of luminal compressibility Presence of an appendicolith. Abdominal CT scan is generally performed only in complex cases or in patients with atypical presentations. Barium enema (BE* Diagnostic laparoscopy Differential diagnosis Gastrointestinal diseases Gastroenteritis Mesenteric lymphadenitis Meckel's diverticulitis Perforated peptic ulcer disease Diverticulitis Cholecystitis Typhlitis Urologic diseases Pyelonephritis Ureteral colic Gynecologic diseases PID Ectopic pregnancy Ovarian cysts Ovarian torsion. Treatment Preoperative preparation Intravenous isotonic fluid replacement Nasogastric suction in patients with peritonitis. Preoperative antibiotic coverage Antibiotic therapy Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is initiated preoperatively Appendectomy The treatment of appendicitis is an appendectomy. Drainage of appendiceal abscess Management remains controversial. Systemic antibiotics and considered for Percutaneous US- or CT-guided catheter drainage Elective appendectomy 6-12 weeks later The appendix must be removed because the patient has a 60% risk of developing appendicitis again within 2 years. Complications Perforation It is accompanied by severe pain and fever. It is unusual within the first 12 hours of appendicitis but It is present in 50% cases < 10 years and > 50 years. Fever, tachycardia, generalized peritonitis, and abscess formation. Treatment is an appendectomy, peritoneal irrigation, and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for several days. Postoperative wound infection The risk is decreased by IV antibiotics administered before skin incision. The incidence increases from nonperforated appendicitis (3%) to a perforated or gangrenous appendix (4.7%). Wound infections are managed by opening, draining, and packing the wound to allow healing by secondary intention. Intravenous antibiotics are indicated for associated cellulitis or systemic sepsis. Intraabdominal and pelvic abscesses Occur most frequently with perforation of the appendix. Best treated hv percutaneous CT- or US-guided aspiration. If the abscess is inaccessible or resistant to percutaneous drainage, operative drainage is indicated. .Antibiotic therapy can mask but does not treat # >i prevent a significant abscess. Pylephlebitis It is septic portal vein thrombosis, usually is caused by Escherichia cob Presents with high fevers, jaundice, and eventually hepatic abscesses. CT scan demonstrates thrombus and gas in the portal vein. Prompt treatment (operative or percutaneous) of the primary infection followed by IV antibiotics. Enterocutaneous fistulas from a: Leak at the appendiceal stump closure May require surgical closure but most close spontaneously.",

The commonest presenting symptoms are unilateral deafness or tinnitus, or a combination of both. Hearing loss is retrocochlear sensorineural type. There is marked difficulty in understanding speech, out of proportion to the pure tone hearing loss, a characteristic feature of acoustic neuroma. Vestibular symptoms are imbalance or unsteadiness. True vertigo is very rare. When the tumor extends beyond 1AC and involves other structures 1cranial nerve It is the earliest nerve to be involved. There is reduced corneal sensitivity and loss of corneal reflex which is the earliest sign of acoustic neuroma. Numbness or paraesthesia of face may occur.

Emergency asynchronous defibrillation is required with at least 200-J monophasic/100-J biphasic shock VENTRICULAR FLUTTER AND VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION (VF) # These arrhythmias occur most often in patients with ischaemic heart disease. # Episodes of cardiac arrest recorded during Holter monitoring reveal that approximately three fourths of the sudden deaths are due to VT or VF. Types: # Ventricular flutter usually appears as a sine wave with a rate between 150 and 300 beats/min. # VF is recognized by grossly irregular undulations of varying amplitudes, contours, and rates. # VT originates below the bundle of His at a rate >100 beats per minute; most VT patients have rates >120 beats per minute. Sustained VT at rates <120 beats per minute and even <100 beats per minute can be observed, particularly in association with the administration of antiarrhythmic agents that can slow the rate. ECG Clues Supporting the Diagnosis of Ventricular Tachycardia # AV dissociation (atrial capture, fusion beats) # QRS duration >140 ms for RBBB type V1 morphology; V1>160 ms for LBBB type V1 morphology # Frontal plane axis -90Adeg to 180Adeg # Delayed activation during initial phase of the QRS complex # LBBB pattem-R wave in V1, V2>40 ms # RBBB pattern-onset of R wave to nadir of S >100 ms # Bizarre QRS pattern that does not mimic typical RBBB or LBBB QRS complex # Concordance of QRS complex in all precordial leads # RS or dominant S in V6 for RBBB VT # Q wave in V6 with LBBB QRS pattern # Monophasic R or biphasic QR or R/S in V1 with RBBB pattern TREATMENT: VENTRICULAR TACHY C ARDIA/FEBRILL ATION # Sustained polymorphic VT, ventricular flutter, and VF all lead to immediate hemodynamic collapse. Emergency asyn- chronous defibrillation is therefore required, with at least 200-J monophasic or 100-J biphasic shock. The shock should be delivered asynchronously to avoid delays related to sensing of the QRS complex. If the arrhythmia persists, repeated shocks with the maximum energy output of the defibrillator are essential to optimize the chance of successful resuscitation. Intravenous lidocaine and/or amiodarone should be administered but should not delay repeated attempts at defibrillation. # For any monomorphic wide complex rhythm that results in hemodynamic compromise, a prompt R-wave synchronous shock is required. Pharmacologic treatment to terminate monomorphic VT is not typically successful (<30%). Intravenous procainamide, lidocaine, or amiodarone can be utilized. Idiopathic LV septal VT appears to respond uniquely to IV verapamil administration. # VT in patients with structural heart disease is now almost always treated with the implantation of an ICD to manage anticipated VT recurrence. The ICD can provide rapid pacing and shock therapy to treat most VTs effectively # Several recent secondary prevention trials have demonstrated superior survival (3 years) in patients treated with ICDs versus amiodarone ALGORITHM: VF | | Assess ABC | | Give pericardial thump and begin CPR till defibrillator is ready | | Defibrillation with 200 J (2 J/kg in children) and repeat with 300 and 360 j (4 J/kg in children) | | Rhythm after first 3 shocks | | | | Asystole Normal rhythm VF still persists | | Intubate at once, obtain IV access and give adrenaline 1 mg IV and defibrillate with 360 J. | | If not aborted, repeat adrenaline in high dose and defibrillate with 360 J. | | If not aborted, give lignocaine/ bretyl ium/MgSO4/NaHCO3 with D-360 J. | | If no response, terminate efforts.",

Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis share the same partway but in opposite direction. Seven reactions of glycolysis are reversible and therefore are used with same enzyme in the synthesis of glucose by gluconeogenesis. However, three of the reactions of glycolysis are irreversible and must be circumvented by four special reactions which are unique to gluconeogenesis and catalyzed by : (1) Pyruvate carboxylaseQ, (ii) Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, (iii) Fructose-1,6- bisphosphataseQ, (iv) Glucose-6-phosphatase. These four enzymes are the key enzy mes of gluconeogenesis (or gluconeogenesis enzymes). Among these four, pyruvate carboxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme and other three are cytoplasmic enzymes. o All three irreversible steps of glycolysis should be bypassed for gluconeogenesis to occur. These three bypass steps are circumvented by four special reactions. First bypass (conversion of pyruvate into phosphoenol pyruvate): - Conversion of pyruvate into phosphoenol pyruvate takes place through two reactions. Carboxylation of pyruvate : - First, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is converted into oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. Pyruvate carboxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme, therefore this reactions occurs in mitochondria only. Conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate : - Oxaloacetate produced in the mitrochondria cannot cross the membrane. It is first reduced to malate, which then moves across the mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. Malate is, then, reoxidized to oxaloacetate in the cytosol. Oxaloacetate is converted to phosphoenol pyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase. Second bypass: - Conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into fructose-6-phosphate is catalyzed by fructose- 1,6-bisphosphatase (PGI 05). Its presence determines w hether a tissue is capable of synthesizing glucose (gluconeogenesis) or glycogen (glyconeogenesis (PGI 05).) not only from py ruvate, but also from triose phosphate. It is present in liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle, but is probably absent from heart and smooth muscle. C) Third bypass : - Conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase.",

        "exp": "Ans- D Phenoxybenzamine Ref - Practice Essentials A pheochromocytoma (see the image below) is a rare, catecholamine-secreting tumor that may precipitate life-threatening hypertension. The tumor is malignant in 10% of cases but may be cured completely by surgical removal. Although pheochromocytoma has classically been associated with 3 syndromes--von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)--there are now 10 genes that have been identified as sites of mutations leading to pheochromocytoma. Axial, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showing large left suprarenal mass of high signal intensity on a T2-weighted image. The mass is a pheochromocytoma. View Media Gallery Signs and symptoms Classically, pheochromocytoma manifests as spells with the following 4 characteristics: Headaches Palpitations Diaphoresis Severe hypertension Typical patterns of the spells are as follows: Frequency may vary from monthly to several times per day Duration may vary from seconds to hours Over time, spells tend to occur more frequently and become more severe as the tumor grows The following may also occur during spells: Tremor Nausea Weakness Anxiety, sense of doom Epigastric pain Flank pain Constipation Clinical signs associated with pheochromocytomas include the following: Hypertension: Paroxysmal in 50% of cases Postural hypotension: From volume contraction Hypertensive retinopathy Weight loss Pallor Fever Tremor Neurofibromas Tachyarrhythmias Pulmonary edema Cardiomyopathy Ileus Cafe au lait spots See Clinical Presentation for more detail. Diagnosis Diagnostic tests for pheochromocytoma include the following: Plasma metanephrine testing: 96% sensitivity, 85% specificity 24-hour urinary collection for catecholamines and metanephrines: 87.5% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity Test selection criteria include the following: Use plasma metanephrine testing in patients at high risk (ie, those with predisposing genetic syndromes or a family or personal history of pheochromocytoma) Use 24-hour urinary collection for catecholamines and metanephrines in patients at lower risk Imaging studies should be performed only after biochemical studies have confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Studies are as follows: Abdominal CT scanning: Has accuracy of 85-95% for detecting adrenal masses with a spatial resolution of 1 cm or greater MRI: Preferred over CT scanning in children and pregnant or lactating women; has reported sensitivity of up to 100% in detecting adrenal pheochromocytomas Scintigraphy: Reserved for biochemically confirmed cases in which CT scanning or MRI does not show a tumor PET scanning: A promising technique for detection and localization of pheochromocytomas Additional studies to rule out a familial syndrome in patients with confirmed pheochromocytoma include the following: Serum intact parathyroid hormone level and a simultaneous serum calcium level to rule out primary hyperparathyroidism (which occurs in MEN 2A) Screening for mutations in the ret proto-oncogene (which give rise to MEN 2A and 2B) Genetic testing for mutations causing the MEN 2A and 2B syndromes Consultation with an ophthalmologist to rule out retinal angiomas (VHL disease) See Workup for more detail. Management Surgical resection of the tumor is the treatment of choice and usually cures the hypertension. Careful preoperative treatment with alpha and beta blockers is required to control blood pressure and prevent intraoperative hypertensive crises. Preoperative medical stabilization is provided as follows: Start alpha blockade with phenoxybenzamine 7-10 days preoperatively Provide volume expansion with isotonic sodium chloride solution Encourage liberal salt intake Initiate a beta blocker only after adequate alpha blockade, to avoid precipitating a hypertensive crisis from unopposed alpha stimulation Administer the last doses of oral alpha and beta blockers on the morning of surgery See Treatment and Medication for more detail.",

However, digoxin actually increases myocardial automaticity (increase in premature beats) and facilitates reentry (atrial tachycardias). Digoxin also slows conduction through A V nodal tissue and has central effects that can mimic vagal influence on the heart and thus may produce sinus arrest. Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with variable block represents the classic rhythm of digitalis intoxication. Digoxin is profibrillatory, but its administration should not lead to atrial flutter. Therapeutic levels of digitalis generate characteristic ST - segment and T-wave changes in most individuals taking the drug. These changes are known as the digitalis effect and consist of ST -segment depression with flattening or inversion of the T wave. The digitalis effect is most prominent in leads with tall R waves.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is histologically sub classified into embryonal, alveolar, and pleomorphic variants. The rhabdomyoblast\u2014the diagnostic cell in all types\u2014contains eccentric eosinophilic granular cytoplasm rich in thick and thin filaments. Rhabdomyoblasts may be round or elongate; the latter are known as tadpole or strap cells, and may contain cross-striations visible by light microscopy.\nEmbryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common type, accounting for 60% of rhabdomyosarcomas. It includes the sarcoma botryoides as well as spindle cell and anaplasticvariants. The tumor occurs in children younger than 10 years of age and typically arises in the nasal cavity, orbit, middle ear, prostate, and paratesticular region. This variant of rhabdomyosarcoma commonly has parental isodisomy of chromosome 11p15.5, which leads to overexpression of the imprinted IGFII gene. The sarcoma botryoides subtype develops in the walls of hollow, mucosal-lined structures, such as the nasopharynx, common bile duct, bladder, and vagina.

It does not appear to cause liver disease.Epidemiological data indicates that virus is prevalent throughout the world and has clearly reestablished transmission modes which are: -Blood and Blood productsSexual transmissionEBV can also be transmitted by blood transfusion.- EBV os present in the transfused WBC.The leucocyte associated viruses are: -CMVEBVHHV-8 (Human herpes virus type 8)HTLV-1 &HTLV-IIHIVWe are not sure of the answer.Now we should look for the virus which is least commonly transmitted.There is confusion in this too because both EBV and Parvovirus are rare with transfusion.An important point * All the viruses mentioned in the question are not routinely screened for blood transfusion.The American Red Cross performs laboratory tests for multiple infectious disease markers on every unit of donated blood.These tests includes: -Chagas diseaseHepatitis B virus (HBV)Hepatitis C virus (HCV)HIV (1,2)HTLV-ISyphilisWest Nile virus (WNV)",

Correct statement is- Usually manifests itself within 24-48 hours of trauma \"Sputum & urine mav reveal the presence of fat a lobulesQ\"- Maheswari 3rd/34 Fat Embolism Syndrome | | | | Pathophysiology * Fat embolism is a common phenomenon It is more commonly seen in patients with multiple fractures and in fractures (involving lower limb especially femurQ * Fat originates from the site of trauma, particularly from the injured marrow of the fractured bones and the suggestion that the fat arises from the plasma as a result of agglutination of chylomicrons is not supported by the vivo experiments,. * Circulating fat globules > 10 mm in diameter occur in most adults after close fracture of long bonesQ and histological traces of fat can be found in the lungs and other internal oigans. * Few of these patients develop clinical features similar to ARDS and are k/a fat embolism syndrome Clinical Presentation - The patient is usually a young adult with a lower limb (esp. femur) fracture, most commonly after closed fractures of long bone (esp) shaft femurQ and more so when fractures are multipleQ - It usually manifests itself within 24-48 hoursQ, but occasionally the onset may be delayed for several days. - Early warning signs (with in 72 hours of injury) are a slight rise in temperature (pyrexia) and pulse rate (tachycardia) Q - In more pronounced cases there is breathlessness, mild mental confusion or restlessness , PectechiacQ on chest, axillae, retina & conjuctival folds; progressing to marked respiratory distress & coma in severe cases. Management * Prevention: - Rough handling, inadequate immobilization and long journey to reach trauma center predisposing factors that must be avoided in long bone fractures - Fracture stabilization by IM nail * Stopping the emboli from reaching main circulation bytieing profunda vein (? of doubtful value) * Removing fat emboli from circulation by - Lipolytic agents as heparinQ ( serum lipase activity) - Hypertonic glucose (decrease F FA production) * Offset its effect by - Vasodilation e.g. phenxv benzamine - Prompt correction of hypovlemia - Prophylactic use of O2 - DextranQ (expand plasma volume, reduce RBC aggregation and platelet adherence) - Aprotinin (this protease inhibitor) decrease platelet aggregation and serotonin release) - Alcohol has vasodilator & lipolytic effect. * Treatment of Established Case - The aim of treatment is maintaining adequate oxygen level in the ventilation. - Oxygen is the only therapeutic tool of proven useQ. It should be administered in sufficient amount to maintain arterial PO 2 > 80 mm Hg - O2 toxicity (pneumonitis) is avoided by using O2 cone, below 40%. - Steroids are given to avoid chemical pneumonitis resulting from break down of pulmonary fat emboli into FFA - Surface cooling w ill diminish O2 demand.",

        "question": "DNA of HBV is?",
        "exp": "Ans- D Ref 1 - Although HBV is among the smallest viruses in terms of virion and genome size, it has numerous unique features that make it completely distinct from other DNA viruses. It has a partially double stranded DNA with highly complex genome organization, life cycle and natural history. Remarkably distinct from other DNA viruses, it uses an RNA intermediate called pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and reverse transcriptase for its genome replication. Genome replication is accomplished by a complex mechanism of primer shifting facilitated by direct repeat sequences encoded in the genome. Ref 2 - jvi.asm.org/content/81/12/6164.full Hepatitis B virus (HBV) contains a small, partially double-stranded, relaxed circular (RC) DNA genome. RC DNA needs to be converted to covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA, which serves as the template for all viral RNA transcription. As a first step toward understanding how CCC DNA is formed, we analyzed the viral and host factors that may be involved in CCC DNA formation, using transient and stable DNA transfections of HBV and the related avian hepadnavirus, duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). Ref 3 - Genome Introduction The Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a major health problem worldwide with more than 350 million people being chronic carriers. HBV causes Hepatitis B, a serious and common infectious disease of the liver. Chronic infection is associated with an increased risk to develop severe liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common forms of human cancer. The estimated risk of HCC in chronic HBV carriers is approximately 100 times greater than in uninfected individuals. Currently available anti-HBV drugs have limitations. Interferon alpha administration is associated with adverse reactions ; nucleoside analogues are virostatic and require long-term administration. Genome organization HBV is an enveloped DNA virus that belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family (NCBI taxonomy, ICTV, ViralZone). It contains a small, partially double-stranded (DS), relaxed-circular DNA (rcDNA) genome that replicates by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). Its length is comprised between 3182 and 3248 bp depending on genotypes. The genome encodes four overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) that are translated into viral core protein, surface proteins, polymerase/reverse transcriptase (RT), and HBx. Replication cycle The HBV life cycle begins when the virus attaches to the host cell and is internalized. Recent studies have demonstrated that sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is a functional receptor in HBV infection.The virion rcDNA is delivered to the nucleus, where it is repaired to form a covalently closed-circular DNA (cccDNA). The episomal cccDNA serves as the template for the transcription of the pgRNA and the other viral mRNAs by the host RNA polymerase II. The transcripts are then exported to the cytoplasm, where translation of the viral proteins occurs. RT binds to pgRNA and triggers assembly of the core proteins into immature, RNA-containing nucleocapsids. The immature nucleocapsids then undergo a process of maturation whereby pgRNA is reversed transcribed by RT to make the mature rcDNA. A unique feature of hepadnavirus reverse transcription is the RT primed initiation of minus-strand DNA synthesis, which leads to the covalent linkage of RT to the 5' end of the minus-strand DNA. The mature, rcDNA-containing nucleocapsids are then enveloped by the viral surface proteins and secreted as virions (secretion pathway) or alternatively, are recycled back to the nucleus to further amplify the pool of cccDNA (recycling pathway). Persistence of cccDNA in hepatocyte plays a key role in viral persistence, reactivation of viral replication after cessation of antiviral therapy and resistance to therapy.",
