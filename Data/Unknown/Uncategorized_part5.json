Recrudescence of infection more in primigravidae Effect of malaria on pregnancy and fetus - Abortion, preterm labor, IUGR, IUD, LBW, Increased maternal mortality and morbidity. Ref- Malaria in pregnant women Last update: 25 May 2017 Malaria infection during pregnancy is a significant public health problem with substantial risks for the pregnant woman, her fetus, and the newborn child. Malaria-associated maternal illness and low birth weight is mostly the result of Plasmodium falciparum infection and occurs predominantly in Africa. The symptoms and complications of malaria in pregnancy vary according to malaria transmission intensity in the given geographical area, and the individual's level of acquired immunity. High-transmission settings In high-transmission settings, where levels of acquired immunity tend to be high, P. falciparum infection is usually asymptomatic in pregnancy. Yet, parasites may be present in the placenta and contribute to maternal anaemia even in the absence of documented peripheral parasitaemia. Both maternal anaemia and placental parasitaemia can lead to low birth weight, which is an important contributor to infant mortality. In high-transmission settings, the adverse effects of P. falciparum infection in pregnancy are most pronounced for women in their first pregnancy. Low-transmission settings In low-transmission settings, where women of reproductive age have relatively little-acquired immunity to malaria, malaria in pregnancy is associated with anemia, an increased risk of severe malaria, and it may lead to spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, prematurity and low birth weight. In such settings, all pregnant women, regardless of the number of times they have been pregnant, are highly vulnerable to malaria. Infections with P. vivax Infection with P. vivax, as with P. falciparum, leads to chronic anaemia and placental malaria infection, reducing the birth weight and increasing the risk of neonatal death. For women in their first pregnancy, the reduction in birth weight is approximately two-thirds of what is associated with P. falciparum, but with P. vivax the effect appears to increase with successive pregnancies. WHO recommends the following package of interventions for the prevention and treatment of malaria during pregnancy: use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs); in all areas with moderate to high malaria transmission in Africa, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), as part of antenatal care services; prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of malaria infections. Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy IPTp reduces maternal malaria episodes, maternal and fetal anemia, placental parasitemia, low birth weight, and neonatal mortality. Furthermore, all pregnant women should receive iron and folic acid supplementation as a part of routine antenatal care.",

It was first described by Golden in 1925 in association with bronchial carcinoma, but it is also seen in metastatic cancer, enlarged lymph nodes, and collapse of the right upper lobe of the lung. The Golden S sign can be seen on plain radiographs as well as on computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest. The sign is seen in the right lung as a distorted minor fissure, whose lateral aspect is concave inferiorly and whose medial aspect is convex inferiorly. This produces a \"reverse S\" appearance, responsible for the sign being occasionally called the reverse S sign of Golden Right upper lope collapse around a large central mass. Discussion: The mass prevents the central part of the lobe from losing volume. Because the peripheral lobe collapses and the central portion doen't. It appears convex centrally and concave peripherally. The shape therefore resembles an S or reverse S, and is called the Golden S sign after Golden's description of cases of lobar collapse caused by carcinoma of the lung.

They present as a high bowel obstruction with abdominal pain and occasionally a palpable right upper quadrant mass An upper gastrointestinal series is almost always diagnostic with the classic coiled. spring appearance of the second and third portions of the duodenum secondary to the crowding of the valvulae conniventes (circular folds) by the hematoma. Nonsurgical management is the mainstay of therapy because the vast majority of duodenal hematomas resolve spontaneously Simple evacuation of the hematoma is the operative procedure of choice. However, bypass procedures and duodenal resection have been performed for this problem. In patients with duodenal obstruction from the superior mesenteric artery syndrome, the obstruction is usually the result of a marked weight loss and, in conjunction with this, loss of the retropentoneal fat pad that elevates the superior mesenteric artery from the third and fourth portions of the duodenum. Nutritional repletion and replenishment of this fat pad will elevate the artery off the duodenum and relieve the obstruction.",

Breast development (gynecomastia) occurs in these males because high levels of circulating testosterone (which cannot act at its receptor) are aromatized to estrogen, which then acts on the breast. The external genitalia develop as those of a female because testosterone cannot masculinize them, while the Mullerian structures are absent because of testicular secretion of Mullerian-inhibiting factor in utero. Gonadal dysgenesis (e.g., 45,X Turner syndrome) is characterized by short stature and absence of pubertal development; in these girls the ovaries are either absent or streak gonads that are nonfunctional. In either case, estrogen production is possible, and therefore isosexual pubertal development does not occur. Kallman syndrome (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) should be suspected in patients of normal stature with delayed or absent pubertal development, especially when associated with the classic finding of anosmia. These individuals have a structural defect of the CNS involving the hypothalamus and the olfactory bulbs (located in close proximity to the hypothalamus), such that the hypothalamus does not secrete GnRH in normal pulsatile fashion, if at all. Other causes of minimal or absent pubertal development with normal stature include malnutrition; anorexia nervosa; severe systemic disease; and intensive athletic training, particularly ballet and running.",

        "question": "The concentration of adrenaline in ACLS/Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation is -",
        "exp": "Ans- D Epinephrine is a commonly used medication in the emergency department for the management of anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest. Administering this drug can be confusing as the dosage and concentration are different for each indication. The \"allergy epi\" 1:1000 concentration is 10 times more concentrated than the \"cardiac epi\". The \"allergy epi\" is delivered IM while the \"cardiac epi\" is delivered IV. This difference leads to an increased risk of error as the incorrect epinephrine dosage, concentration, or route can have disastrous consequences for patients including coronary dissection, infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias (1-3). Here is a little saying to easily remember the dosage and concentration of epinephrine in both anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest... Anaphylaxis and Epinephrine Dosage LESS (volume) is MORE (concentrated) Less (0.5cc) is More (1:1000) Use 1/2 ml of 1:1000 epinephrine and deliver it into the muscle (IM). This will deliver a total of 0.5mg of epinephrine IM. Cardiac Arrest and Epinephrine Dosage MORE (volume) is LESS (concentrated) More (10cc) is Less (1: 10,000) Use 10cc of 1: 10,000 epinephrine and give it intravenously (IV). This will deliver 1mg of epinephrine IV. References Kanwar M, Irvin CB, Frank JJ, et al.

Epinephrine in anaphylaxis: higher risk of cardiovascular complications and overdose after administration of intravenous bolus epinephrine compared with intramuscular epinephrine. J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract. 2015 Jan-Feb;3(1):76-80 Epinephrine is the primary drug used in the cardiac arrest algorithm. It is used for its potent vasoconstrictive effects and also for its ability to increase cardiac output. Epinephrine is considered a vasopressor. Indications for ACLS Vasoconstriction effects: epinephrine binds directly to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors of the blood vessels (arteries and veins) causing direct vasoconstriction, thus, improving perfusion pressure to the brain and heart. Cardiac Output: epinephrine also binds to beta-1-adrenergic receptors of the heart. This indirectly improves cardiac output by: Increasing heart rate Increasing heart muscle contractility Increasing conductivity through the AV node Epinephrine is used in the cardiac arrest algorithm as a direct IV push and also in the bradycardia algorithm as an infusion. See the respective algorithm pages for more information about their use in each. Routes During ACLS, epinephrine can be given 3 ways: intravenous; intraosseous, and endotracheal tube Dosing Intravenous Push/IO: 1mg epinephrine IV is given every 3-5 minutes. IV infusion for bradycardia: 1mg epinephrine is mixed with 500ml of NS or D5W. The infusion should run at 2-10 micrograms/min (titrated to effect). IV infusion for post-cardiac arrest hypotension: The dosing is 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min (for example a 70kg adult: 7-35 mcg/min would be given). Endotracheal Tube: 2-2.5mg epinephrine is diluted in 10cc NS and given directly into the ET tube. Epinephrine should be used with caution in patients suffering from myocardial infarction since epinephrine increases heart rate and raises blood pressure. This increase in HR and BP can increase myocardial oxygen demand and worsen ischemia. Note: There is no clinical evidence that the use of epinephrine, when used during cardiac arrest, increases rates of survival to discharge from the hospital. However, studies have shown that epinephrine and vasopressin improve rates of ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation). Adult Basic Life Support Algorithm for Healthcare Providers In the algorithm for adult basic life support, emphasis is placed upon immediate recognition of cardiac arrest and the implementation of efficient compressions and early defibrillation. To immediately recognize cardiac arrest, the healthcare provider is trained to assess for unresponsiveness and/or an absence of breathing or presence of abnormal breath sounds. Laypersons should be instructed to use hands-only CPR. This approach calls for continuous compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute. CPR should be continued by a healthcare provider until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or until termination of efforts. High quality CPR emphasizes adequate depth and number of chest compressions. The pulse check has been deemphasized, and the guidelines recommend a pulse check for no less than 5 seconds and no more than 10 seconds. An integrated team approach includes simultaneous compressions and rescue breathing. Rhythm detection should take place as soon as an AED or defibrillator is available, with subsequent shock, as indicated, as the survival rate from ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia ranges from 5% to 50%, and decreases with an increase in the length of time to the first shock. When a victim is unresponsive to a tap on the chest (ask \"Are you ok?\"), then the healthcare provider should observe the victim for breathing for 5 to 10 seconds. If respirations are present, the victim should be attached to a cardiac monitor. Otherwise, the healthcare provider (HCP) should activate EMS and retrieve the AED by himself or by sending a second rescuer. The pulse check is the third step in the algorithm. The pulse should be checked for no less than 5 seconds and no more than 10 seconds. If there is a definite pulse, then rescue breathing should be done for one second every six seconds with a recheck every 2 minutes. If the victim does not have a pulse, or there is a question as to whether it is present, then compressions should be initiated at the rate of 30:2, with 2 breaths every 30 compressions. Compressions should be provided at a rate of 100-120/min. When the AED or defibrillator is available, then the HCP should check the victim's rhythm. If it is shockable, then 1 shock should be given with immediate CPR instituted for 2 minutes, beginning rapidly (within seconds) of the shock. If the rhythm is not shockable, then the HCP should administer CPR for 2 minutes and recheck the rhythm every 2 minutes. Continue CPR until ALS is available. High quality chest compressions: Position patient on hard surface in supine position Minimal interruptions for ventilation 18 seconds per cycle Adequate speed of compressions: >100/minute Adequate depth of compressions: 2-2.4\" (5-6cm) Allow complete recoil of chest Do not over ventilate Breathing devices include a ONE WAY VALVE FACE MASK. Deliver breath over one second. Watch the chest rise. A BAG VALVE MASK is an additional device to deliver breaths. Hold the mask in place with the EC clamp technique and lift the jaw to open the airway. Squeeze the bag for one second while watching for the rise and fall of the chest.

Check for response. Check for response. 3 Shout for nearby help. Phone or ask someone to phone 9-1-1 (the phone or caller with the phone remains at the victim's side, with the phone on speaker). Shout for nearby help and activate the emergency response system (9-1-1, emergency response). If someone responds, ensure that the phone is at the side of the victim if at all possible. Shout for nearby help/activate the resuscitation team; can activate the resuscitation team at this time or after checking breathing and pulse. 4 Follow the dispatcher's instructions. Check for no breathing or only gasping; if none, begin CPR with compressions. Check for no breathing or only gasping and check pulse (ideally simultaneously). Activation and retrieval of the AED/emergency equipment by either the lone healthcare provider or by the second person sent by the rescuer must occur no later than immediately after the check for no normal breathing and no pulse identifies cardiac arrest. 5 Look for no breathing or only gasping, at the direction of the dispatcher. Answer the dispatcher's questions, and follow the dispatcher's instructions. Immediately begin CPR, and use the AED/ defibrillator when available. 6 Follow the dispatcher's instructions. Send the second person to retrieve an AED, if one is available. When the second rescuer arrives, provide 2-person CPR and use AED/defibrillator. AED indicates automated external defibrillator; and CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",

At around 6th week of pregnancy, due to the physiological changes of pregnancy the ureters begin to dilate. This is also known as \"hydronephrosis of pregnancy\", which peaks at 22-26 weeks and continues to persist until delivery.1 Both progesterone and estrogens levels increase during pregnancy and these will lead to decreased ureteral and bladder tone. Increased plasma volume during pregnancy leads to decrease urine concentration and increased bladder volume.1 The combination of all these factors lead to urinary stasis and uretero-vesical reflux. Glycosuria in pregnancy is also another well-known factor which predisposes mothers to UTI.",

        "exp": "The clinical manifestations are highly characteristic of myasthenia gravis. This disorder has three general features: the fluctuating nature of muscle weakness, predominant involvement of ocular muscles (with diplopia and ptosis), and positive clinical response to administration of cholinergic agents. Crisis of weakness involving respiratory muscles was the most frequent cause of death before the advent of positive pressure respirators. The disease is autoimmune-mediated and results from autoantibodies to the muscular nicotinic receptors. Besides the pharmacologic test, a progressive decrease in the amplitude of muscle potential is the diagnostic feature of myasthenia gravis. Electromyography is therefore very useful in the diagnosis of this condition. Blood, urine, and CSF analysis are entirely within normal limits in myasthenia gravis, although they are indeed frequently performed in the initial screening.\nMRI of the head\u00a0 and EEG recording would be entirely useless in this setting. Since the disorder is due to impaired cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction, skeletal muscle biopsy\u00a0 is within normal limits at the light microscopic level. Occasionally muscle biopsy is performed to rule out other causes of muscle weakness, such as myopathic processes.",

However, it does not discriminate between vascular defects, thrombocytopenia, and platelet dysfunction.Platelet enumerationPlatelet volume measurementsPlatelet aggregationClot Retraction: Clot retraction usually is deficient when the platelet count is below 50,000/pl and in a rare disorder of platelet function (Glanzmann thrombasthenia). It is normal in most other disorders of platelet function. This test is primarily of historical interest; Glanzmann thrombasthenia is typically diagnosed using platelet aggregation methods or flow cytometer.Tests of Coagulation Phase:Partial thromboplastin time: The PTT is a simple test of the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. When a mixture of plasma and a phospholipid platelet substitute is recalcified, fibrin forms at a normal rate only if the factors involved in the intrinsic pathway (prekallikrein, high-molecular-weight kininogen, and factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII) and in the common pathway (factors X and V, prothrombin, and fibrinogen) are present in normal amounts. The PTT is somewhat more sensitive to deficiencies of factors VIII and IX than to deficiencies of factors XI and XII or factors involved in the common pathwayProthrombin time The production of fibrin by means of the extrinsic and common pathways requires tissue factor and factor VII, in addition to factors X and V, Prothrombin, and fibrinogenThromboplastin generation test: The thromboplastin generation test is important for historical reasons.

Explanation: Some bacteria have a layer of material lying outside the cell wall. When the layer is well organized and not easily washed off, it is called a capsule. A slime layer is a zone of diffuse, unorganized material that is removed easily. Capsules and slime layers usually are composed of polysaccharides, but Bacillus anthracis has a capsule of poly-D-glutamic acid. Some bacteria may have both a capsule and a slime layer (for example. Streptococcus salivarius). Special capsule staining techniques are available, usually employing copper salts as mordants. Capsules may be readily demonstrated by negative staining in wet films with India ink. Histoplasma capsulatum: It is a dimorphic fungus which causes intracellular infection of the reticuloendothelial system. Blood and marrow smear stained with Giemsa or calcofluor white stain show intracellular 2-4 pm budding yeast cells (within macrophages or histiocytes). It was initially believed to possess a capsule and was named as H. capsulatum. However, it was later found that it does not have a capsule. Cryptococcus neoformans : It is a round budding cell, 4-20 urn in diameter, with a prominent polysaccharide capsule. It is a soil saprophyte and is particularly abundant in the feces of pigeons and other birds. The capsule can be demonstrated as a clear halo by India ink. Candida albicans : Candida albicans is an ovoid or spherical budding cell, which produces pseudomvcelia both in culture and in tissues. Candida albicans is a pathogenic yeast-like fungus. Coccidioides immitis : The fungus is dimorphic, occurring in the tissue as a yeast and in culture (both at 37degC and at room temperature) as the mycelial form. The tissue form is a spherule, 15-75 pm in diameter, w ith a thick doubly refractile wall and filled with endospores",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Tropomyosin Muscle contraction o The shortening of muscle fiber occurs due to sliding of actin filaments on myosin filament. However, there are four muscle proteins involved in the process: - Actin, Myosin, Tropomyosin, and troponin. Myosin Myosin is the protein that constitutes the thick filaments. Myosin of skeletal muscle is myosin-II. Myosin participates in the contractile mechanism and also acts as an ATPaseQ Actin Actin is the major protein of thin filamentQ. It is the actin which slides over myosin during contraction. Tropomyosin It is the other protein of thin filamentQ. It covers the active sites (myosin binding sites) on actinQ. When Ca+2 concentration of cytoplasm (sarcoplasm) is raised, it uncovers the active sites of actin and allows the contraction So, the 'cross-bridge cycling' is switched off or on by the tropomyosin molecule which slides on the actin molecule to cover or uncover the active sites on it. Troponin It is a protein also associated with thin filamentQ. The regulatory action of Ca+2 on tropomysin is mediated by troponin, a Ca+2 binding protein. When the cytoplasmic (sarcoplasmic) Ca+2 concentration rises Ca+2 ions bind to troponin-C. The troponin - Ca+2 complex induces changes in Troponin-I and Troponin-T, which in turn brings about a shift of tropomyosin away from the active sites of actin. When the sarcoplasmic Ca+2 concentration falls, Ca+2: dissociates from troponin-C and tropomyosin slides back on the actin filament to cover the active sites. Thus, the first event during muscle contraction, after the cytoplasmic rise in Ca+2 concentration, is binding of troponin C to Ca+2 which trigers the further steps by sliding the tropomyosin from the active sites of actinQ.",

All vertical health and family welfare programmes at the district level will merge into one common \"District health Mission\" and at state level into \"State health mission\" there will be the provision of a \"mobile medical unit\" at the district level for improved outreach services.o Since almost 75 percent of health services are being currently provided by the private sector, it is contemplated that involving the private sector as part of the RCH initiatives will provide the more effective health care delivery system. Thus setting up of \"public-private partnership\" (PPP) would help to make the RCH II programme better, and ensure availability or preventive and curative reproductive and health services to the community,o Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) is a safe motherhood intervention under the National Rural Health Mission being implemented with the objective of reducing maternal & neonatal mortality by promoting institutional delivery among the poor pregnant women.o The schedule of implementation of major components of NRHM are as following (40):The merger of multiple societies and constitution of district/state mission.Provision of additional generic drugs at SC PHC/CHC level.Operational programme management units.Preparation of village health plans.ASHA at village level (with drug kit)Upgrading of rural hospitalOperationalising district planningMobile medical unit at the district levelThe Goals to be achieved by NRHM (40)A National levelInfant mortality' rate reduced to 30/1,000 live births.Maternal mortality' ratio reduced to 100/100,000.Total fertility rate reduced - 50% by 2010, an additional 10% by 2012.Malaria mortality- rate reduction -50% by 2010 additional 10% by 2012.Kala-azar mortality rate reduction -100% by 2010 and sustaining elimination until 2012.FilariaL'microfilaria rate reduction - 70% by 2010,80% by 2012 and elimination until 2015.Dengue mortality rate reduction - 50% by 2010 and sustaining at that level until 2012.Japanese encephalitis mortality' rate reduction - 50% by 2010 and sustaining at that level until 2012.Cataract operation: increasing to 46 lakhs per year by 2012.Leprosy prevalence rate: from 1.8/10,000 in 2005 to less titan 1/10,000 thereafter.Tuberculosis DOTS services: maintain 85% cure rate through entire mission period.Upgrading community' health centers to Indian public health standards.Increase utilization of first referral units from less than 20% to 75%.Engaging 250,000 female accredited social health activists (ASHA) in 10 states.B.

Larynx opens into lower respiratory tract which starts from Trachea. Trachea bifurcates into bronchi (principal bronchi). Progressive branching of bronchi forms bronchioles. Further branching of bronchioles leads to terminal bronchioles. Terminal bronchiole emanate into respiratory bronchioles. Respiratory bronchioles proceed into the alveolar ducts, which immediately branch into alveolar sacs (alveoli).o The part of lung distal to the terminal bronchiole is called acinus, i.e., respiratory bronchiole, alveolar duct and alveolar sac. A cluster of three to five terminal bronchioles, each with its appended acinus, is usually referred to as pulmonary lobule. So, pulmonary lobules include a cluster of three to five terminal bronchioles with its respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs.o Terminal bronchioles contain Clara cells which secrete a protein that lines the small air passages. Alveoli (alveolar sac) are lined by type 1 pneumocytes (95%) and type 2pneumocytes (5%). Type 2pneumocytes secrete surfactant and also helps in repair of alveoli after the destruction of type-1 pneumocytes. Pores of Kohn are present in the alveolar wall to allow passage of bacteria and exudate between adjacent alveoli.o The respiratory tract is lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium, except vocal cord, which is lined by stratified squamous epithelium.o Terminal bronchi contain maximum smooth muscle cells relative to wall thickness.o Cartilage is found in larynx, trachea, and bronchi but not in bronchioles.",

Weakness on one side will lead to a drop in the pelvis on the contralateral side of the pelvis while walking (Trendelenburg sign, lurching gait). With bilateral weakness, there will be dropping of the pelvis on both sides during walking leading to waddling. This gait is seen in a patient with bilateral superior gluteal nerve injury and myopathies, such as muscular dystrophy.Positive Trendelenburg's sign due to Injury to Superior Gluteal Nerve:The Trendelenburg's sign is said to be positive if, when standing on one leg, the pelvis drops on the side opposite to the stance leg. The weakness is present on the side of the stance leg. The body is not able to maintain the center of gravity on the side of the stance leg. Normally, the body shifts the weight to the stance leg, allowing the shift of the center of gravity and consequently stabilizing or balancing the bodyHowever, in unilateral superior gluteal nerve injury, when the patient lifts the opposing leg, the shift is not created and the patient cannot maintain balance leading to instability (Lurching gait). Bilateral superior gluteal nerve injury results in a waddling gait.NOTE: Not to be confused with Trendelenburg's sign. The Trendelenburg Test or Brodie-Trendelenburg test is a test which can be carried out as part of a physical examination to determine the competency of the valves in the superficial and deep veins of the legs in patients with varicose veins.

The molecule has a sulfhydryl f-SH) or thiol group on the cysteine, which accounts for its strong electron-donating character,o It exists in two forms : reduced glutathione or GSH. In the reduced state, the thiol group of cysteine is able to donate a reducing equivalent (H+ e-) to other unstable molecules, such as reactive oxygen species. In donating an electron, glutathione itself becomes reactive, but readily reacts with another reactive glutathione to form glutathione disulfide (GSSG) or oxidized glutathione. GSH can be regenerated from GSSG by the enzyme glutathione reductase.o While all cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing glutathione, liver glutathione synthesis has been shown to be essential. The liver is the largest GSH reservoir.o Because of its reducing property, reduced glutathione has potent antioxidant action,o Functions:a) GSH is an extremely important cell protectant. It directly reduces reactive hydroxyl free radicals, other oxygen centered free radicals, and radical centers on DNA and other biomolecules.b) GSH is the essential cofactor for many enzymes which require thiol-reducing equivalents, and helps keep redox-sensitive active sites on enzymes in the necessary reduced state. GSH is used as a cofactor by -Multiple peroxidase enzymes, to detoxify peroxides generated from oxygen radical attack on biological molecules;Transhydrogenases, to reduce oxidized centers on DNA, proteins, and other biomolecules; andGlutathione S-transferases (GST) to conjugate GSH with endogenous substances (e.g., estrogens) and to exogenous electrophiles (e.g., arene oxides, unsaturated carbonyls, organic halides), and diverse xenobiotics.GSH is a primary'' protectant of skin, lens, cornea, and retina against radiation damage, and the biochemical foundation of P450 detoxication in the liver, kidneys, lungs, intestinal epithelia, and other organs.GSH acts as a carrier in transport of certain amino acids across membranes in the kidney.Glutathione (GSH) participates in leukotriene synthesis.",

On radiological examination, this is the presentation of the patient, what is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Ans. (b) Crohn's disease. The image represents cobblestone appearance which is characteristic of Crohn's disease. Differences between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease * UC is a mucosal disease, whereas CD affects the full thickness of the bowel wall * UC produces confluent disease in the colon and rectum, whereas CD is characterized by skip lesions * Ulcerative colitis affects the colon; Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but particularly the small and large bowel * CD more commonly causes stricturing and fistulation * CD is often associated with perianal disease, whereas this is unusual in UC * CD affecting the terminal ileum may produce symptoms mimicking appendicitis, but this does not occur in UC * Resection of the colon and rectum cures the patient with UC, whereas recurrence is common after resection in CD * Granulomas may be found on histology in CD, but not in UC Image source- Ref of below image- Ref- Crohn disease, also known as regional enteritis, is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease characterised by widespread discontinuous gastrointestinal tract inflammation. The terminal ileum and proximal colon are most often affected. Extraintestinal disease is common. Epidemiology The diagnosis is typically made between the ages of 15 and 25 years with no gender predilection 5. There is a familial component and incidence varies geographically. Clinical presentation Patients typically present with chronic diarrhoea and recurrent abdominal pain, although occasionally the presentation is with a complication or an extraintestinal manifestation. Anaemia may be present and C-reactive protein may be elevated 29. Faecal calprotectin has been increasingly used in recent years to: distinguish inflammatory bowel disease from irritable bowel syndrome assess disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease, including acute exacerbations and response to treatment 26 Pathology Crohn disease remains idiopathic, although infective agents have been gaining in popularity as a possible cause, including the measles virus and atypical mycobacterium. As there are definite genetic factors at play, multiple factors are likely to contribute 1. Incidence is higher in people with first degree relatives having IBD, reaching up to 10%. Also, there has been shown 30-50% chance of developing the disease in mono- or heterozygous twins. Initially, the disease is limited to the mucosa with neutrophilic cryptitis and lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphoedema and shallow aphthoid ulceration. As the disease progresses, the entire bowel wall becomes involved, with linear longitudinal and circumferential ulcers extending deep into the bowel wall, predisposing to fistulae. Inflammation also extends into the mesentery and over time leads to chronic fibrotic change, and stricture formation 5. Anywhere along the digestive tract, including mouth and oesophagus mucogingivitis, mucosal tags, deep ulceration, cobblestoning, lip swelling and pyostomatitis vegetans, oesophageal ulcers and strictures Extraintestinal manifestations include 3,15-17: skin erythema nodosum pyoderma gangrenosum joints arthritis seronegative spondyloarthritis sacroiliitis (one of the most frequent extraintestinal manifestations) eyes episcleritis iritis uveitis (acute anterior uveitis) liver and biliary system pericholangitis primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) (more common in ulcerative colitis) autoimmune hepatitis cirrhosis gallstones: seen in 30-50% 8 hepatic abscess 8 pancreatitis renal tract renal calculi containing oxalate. The poor fat absorption results in binding of calcium by fats, which in turn reduces the amount of calcium that can bind to oxalate, therefore increasing the amount of unbound oxalate available for resorption; this resorption occurs in the colon, and therefore patients with an ileostomy do not have the same increased risk pulmonary and thoracic associations bronchiectasis, mosaic perfusion, and air trapping chronic bronchitis, interstitial lung disease, cryptogenic organising pneumonia, necrobiotic nodules 30 Radiographic features The characteristic of Crohn disease is the presence of skip lesions and presence of discrete ulcers. The frequency with which various parts of the gastrointestinal tract are affected varies widely 5: small bowel: 70-80% 5,6 small and large bowel: 50% large bowel only: 15-20% The choice of investigation modality depends on local expertise and availability. CT and MR enteroclysis are similar in sensitivity for active inflammation (89% vs 83% respectively) and both are somewhat better than small bowel follow-through (67-72%) 6. The lack of ionising radiation from MRI would make it a better option, however, the availability of MRI is limited in many countries. Ultrasound is also an option for diagnosing active disease, follow-up and assessing complications 20. Reported sensitivity 75-94% and specificity 67-100% 20. Fluoroscopy Features on barium small bowel follow-through include: mucosal ulcers aphthous ulcers initially deep ulcers (>3 mm depth) longitudinal fissures transverse stripes when severe leads to cobblestone appearance may lead to sinus tracts and fistulae widely separated loops of bowel due to fibrofatty proliferation (creeping fat) 2 thickened folds due to oedema pseudodiverticula formation: due to contraction at the site of ulcer with ballooning of the opposite site string sign: tubular narrowing due to spasm or stricture depending on the chronicity partial obstruction on control films presence of gallstones, renal oxalate stones, and sacroiliac joint or lumbosacral spine changes should be sought Ultrasound Ultrasound has a limited role, but due to it being cheap and available and not involving ionising radiation, it has been evaluated as an initial screening tool for active disease and also for follow-up and to assess complications 4,20. Typically examination is limited to the small bowel and wall thickness assessed: bowel wall thickness should be <3 mm The usefulness of this finding needs to be interpreted in the context of pretest probability (i.e. thickness of less than 3 mm helps exclude the disease in a low-risk patient, and a thickness of greater than 4 mm helps establish the diagnosis in a high-risk patient) 4. As it has difficulty examining the whole bowel, it is not appropriate as a true diagnostic test. On Doppler evaluation, increased superior mesenteric artery (SMA) flow volume and decreased SMA resistive index (SMA RI) also correlate with disease activity. Successful treatment may result in the normalisation of these imaging parameters 12. Other features on ultrasound 20: non-compressible, rigid, fixed bowel wall perienteric fluid creeping fat - echogenic area (representing proliferation of adipose tissue that extends around active inflammation) separating bowel loops gut signature - lost or preserved strictures - fibrotic (maintains gut signature) or inflammatory (loss of gut signature) abscess fistula Ultrasound does, of course, have a significant role to play in the assessment of: perianal disease: rectal ultrasound, endoanal ultrasound hepatobiliary disease CT CT examination can be carried out with both intravenous and intraluminal contrast (positive or negative) 5: fat halo sign comb sign bowel wall enhancement bowel wall thickening (1-2 cm) which is most frequently seen in the terminal ileum (present in up to 83% of patients) 8 strictures and fistulae mesenteric/intra-abdominal abscess or phlegmon formation 8 abscesses are eventually seen in 15-20% of patients 8 CT is also able to give valuable information on: perianal disease hepatobiliary disease MRI MRI enterography has no ionising radiation and an ability to evaluate both mural and extramural involvement. It has become an increasingly important part of the management of patients with Crohn disease. MRI enteroclysis may be attempted in select patients. MR enterography MR enterography can be a useful technique for evaluation of the bowel. Inflamed loops of bowel demonstrate thickening >3 mm and increased mural contrast enhancement 22. Increased T2W signal in the thickened bowel wall is particularly helpful in evaluating for acute inflammation 25. Extramural disease is where MRI excels: fibrofatty proliferation thickening of extramural fat, which separates bowel loops equivalent to the fat halo sign on CT vascular engorgement: comb sign stenoses and strictures Coronal cine sequences (bSSFP) can also be useful in diagnosis. Inflamed loops of bowel frequently demonstrate decreased peristalsis. MRI enteroclysis MRI enteroclysis requires the placement of a nasojejunal catheter through which 1.5-2 L of contrast solution (e.g. water with polyethylene glycol and electrolytes) are injected 2. Spatial resolution is not as good as with conventional fluoroscopic enteroclysis, and thus minor mucosal changes are not apparent. When the disease is transmural, with cobblestone appearance, the abnormalities are evident as high T2 signal linear regions, provided adequate distension is achieved 2. Standard MRI Standard MRI can also give valuable information: perianal disease hepatobiliary disease sacroiliac joints, spine and large joints Treatment and prognosis Management is complex as the condition is chronic with a relapsing-remitting course. Medical management includes corticosteroids, 5-ASA preparations, immunomodulation (e.g. azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate) 7. Surgical management is reserved for complications including: strictures adhesions and bowel obstructions fistulae perianal disease perianal fistula perianal abscess History and etymology It is named after Burrill Bernard Crohn (1884-1983), an American gastroenterologist, who described the condition as 'regional ileitis' in his seminal 1932 paper 11,24. However, the first definite description (but see below) was nearly twenty years prior, by Sir T (Thomas) Kennedy Dalziel (1861-1924), a Scottish surgeon, in 1913 21,23. Antoni Lesniowski (1867-1940), a Polish surgeon, described a small bowel condition in 1904 in a small series of four patients, with similarities to Crohn disease, although it remains controversial if it was actually Crohn's 27,28. At least one of the patients probably actually had ileal tuberculosis. Nevertheless Polish physicians and journals usually call the condition Lesniowski-Crohn disease. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis depends on the presenting symptom. When terminal ileitis is the main presentation, then differentials (adjusted for patient's age) include 1: acute appendicitis Yersinia ileitis mesenteric adenitis ileocaecal tuberculosis 9 malignancy When colonic involvement is the predominant feature then other considerations include: ulcerative colitis acute diverticulitis acute epiploic appendagitis ischaemic colitis pseudomembranous colitis infectious colitis",

        "question": "Component of ART given to the mother in the prevention of mother to child transmission -",
        "exp": "Ans- D Tenofovir, efavirenz and lamivudine Ref 1 - The current WHO guidelines of June 2013 recommends two options for PPTCT: (i) provision of lifelong ART to all the pregnant and breast feeding women living with HIV regardless of CD4 count or clinical stage (earlier called Option B+) or (ii) provision of ART during pregnancy and breast feeding and thereafter providing ART as indicated.8 Having gone through 30 years of the global AIDS epidemic, it is now felt that, despite hindrance, PPTCT of HIV can be considered as a realistic public health goal. Government of India is committed to working towards achievement of the global target of \"elimination of new HIV infections among children\" by 2015 and has decided to adopt the first option i.e lifelong ART (triple drug regime) irrespective of CD4 count or WHO clinical staging.9 This, in turn, is expected to help maximise the coverage to those needing treatment, avoiding the need for starting ART in future pregnancies, provide protection against parent-to-child transmission in future pregnancies and avoid drug resistance. These guidelines have been implemented across the country from 1st January 2014. The aim is to ensure integrated PPTCT services within the existing Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) programme.5 The recommended first-line regimen for HIV infected pregnant women is Tenofovir (TDF) (300 mg) + Lamivudine (3TC) (300 mg) + Efavirenz (EFV) (600 mg) at any gestational age. Further, as part of PPTCT, the infant also needs to be exposed to NVP for at least 06 weeks, but increased to 12 weeks in case the mother was started on ART late in her pregnancy. However, the last word has not been said and warnings about the use of Option/Plan B + are also being published.10 Triple drug therapy decreases the viral load substantially, thus paving the way for normal delivery and breast feeding. The exclusive breast feeding is recommended by NACO to avoid chances of gastrointestinal infection and malnutrition. Vertical transmission of HIV from mother to the newborn generally occurs during contact of the foetus with vaginal secretion after rupture of amniotic membrane. Therefore elective caesarean section was considered an option for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. With decrease in viral load in vaginal secretions due to antenatal use of triple drug therapy, vaginal delivery is now considered safe and the caesarean section is recommended only for obstetric indications. Ref 2 - A comprehensive approach to PMTCT Effective PMTCT programmes require women and their infants to have access to - and to take up - a cascade of interventions including antenatal services and HIV testing during pregnancy; use of ART by pregnant women living with HIV; safe childbirth practices and appropriate infant feeding; uptake of infant HIV testing and other post-natal healthcare services.4 The World Health Organization (WHO) promotes a comprehensive approach to PMTCT programmes which includes: preventing new HIV infections among women of childbearing age preventing unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV preventing HIV transmission from a woman living with HIV to her baby providing appropriate treatment, care and support to mothers living with HIV and their children and families.5 World Health Organization PMTCT guidelines Guidelines for pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV WHO's 2013 guidelines recommended that a woman living with HIV only continue on ART after breastfeeding if it would benefit her own health.6 However, in September 2015 the WHO released new guidelines recommending that all pregnant women living with HIV be immediately provided with lifelong treatment, regardless of CD4 count (which indicates the level of HIV in the body). This approach is called Option B+.7 By 2015, the implementation of Option B+ had resulted in 91% of the 1.1 million women receiving ARVs as part of PMTCT services being offered lifelong ART.8 In resource-poor settings, when formula feeding is not a viable option, the WHO advises women living with HIV to exclusively breastfeed (rather than mixed feeding), providing that they are on ART. This is because, while formula feeding offers the safest option for postnatal HIV prevention, in resource poor settings it is not always easy for families to afford formula or access things such as clean water which are needed for it use.9 Guidelines for HIV-exposed infants If an HIV-exposed infant is given ART within the first 12 weeks of life, they are 75% less likely to die from an AIDS related illness.10 This is one of the reasons that WHO recommends that infants born to mothers living with HIV are tested between four and six weeks old. This is often referred to as 'early infant diagnosis'.11 The WHO further recommends that another HIV test is carried out at 18 months and/or when breastfeeding ends to provide the final infant diagnosis.12 According to WHO guidelines, all infants who test positive for HIV should be immediately initiated on treatment. The treatment should be linked to the mother's course of ARVs and would vary according to the infant feeding method as follows: breastfeeding - the infant should receive once-daily nevirapine from birth for six weeks replacement feeding - the infant should receive once-daily nevirapine (or twice-daily zidovudine) from birth for four to six weeks.13 Global PMTCT targets In 2011, a Global Plan was launched to reduce the number of new HIV infections via mother-to-child transmission by 90% by 2015.14 The WHO identified 22 priority countries, with the top 10 (Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana and India) accounting for 75% of the global PMTCT service need. It was estimated that the effective scaling up of interventions in these countries would prevent over 250,000 new infections annually.15",

By this technique, the length of functional intramural ureter (FUimL) was estimated to be 10-15 mm and the resting pressure in the intramural ureter (Pr) was between 5 and 10 mmHg in patients with possibly normal intramural ureter (4 ureters). In cases of chronic dysuria with cystographic evidence of morphologic changes in the bladder and with no vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), the FUimL was 5 mm and the Pr 2-3 mmHg.

        "question": "Treatment of cholera in pregnancy is -",
        "exp": "Ans-D Ref- Recommendations for the Use of Antibiotics for the Treatment of Cholera Summary Recommendations Oral or intravenous hydration is the mainstay of cholera treatment. In conjunction with hydration, treatment with antibiotics is recommended for severely ill patients. It is particularly recommended for patients who are severely or moderately dehydrated and continue to pass a large volume of stool during rehydration treatment. Antibiotic treatment is also recommended for all patients who are hospitalized. Antibiotic choices should be informed by local antibiotic susceptibility patterns. In most countries, Doxycycline is recommended as first-line treatment for adults, while azithromycin is recommended as first-line treatment for children and pregnant women. During an epidemic or outbreak, antibiotic susceptibility should be monitored through regular testing of sample isolates from various geographic areas. None of the guidelines recommend antibiotics as prophylaxis for cholera prevention, and all emphasize that antibiotics should be used in conjunction with aggressive hydration. Education of health care workers, assurance of adequate supplies, and monitoring of practices are all important for appropriate dispensation of antibiotics. Background Mainstay of cholera treatment is hydration Intravenous 1 and oral 2 hydration are both associated with greatly decreased mortality and remain the mainstay of treatment for cholera. Antibiotic effectiveness for the treatment of cholera Antibiotics have been used as an adjunct to hydration treatment for cholera since 1964. Findings from randomized controlled trials evaluated the effectiveness of selected antibiotics on three main outcomes: stool output, duration of diarrhea, and bacterial shedding.These studies compared outcomes for cholera patients who were given both intravenous (IV) fluids and antibiotic treatment with those given IV fluids only. Findings indicate that antibiotics reduced volume of stool output by 8-92%, duration of diarrhea by 50-56%, and duration of positive bacterial culture by 26-83% 3-7. Antibiotic use for moderately and severely ill patients is also likely to reduce resource requirements. By decreasing duration of diarrhea and stool volume, antibiotics result in more rapid recovery and shorter lengths of inpatient stay, both of which contribute to optimizing resource utilization in an outbreak setting. The majority of published studies exploring effectiveness of antibiotics for cholera patients have been done in patients who were adequately rehydrated. In these studies, there was no mortality and therefore the impact of antibiotics on mortality cannot be assessed. In the absence of adequate rehydration, antibiotics alone are not sufficient to prevent cholera mortality. Antibiotic regimens for the treatment of cholera Tetracycline has been shown to be effective treatment for cholera 2, 3 and is superior to furazolidone 8, cholamphenicol 9 and sulfaguanidine 9 in reducing cholera morbidity. Treatment with a single 300mg dose of doxycycline has shown to be equivalent to tetracycline treatment 10. Erythromycin is effective for cholera treatment, and appropriate for children and pregnant women 11. Orfloxacin 12, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 13, and ciprofloxacin 14 are effective, but doxycycline offers advantages related to ease of administration and comparable or superior effectiveness. Recently, azithromycin has been shown to be more effective than erythromycin and ciprofloxacin 15, 16 and is an appropriate first line regimen for children and pregnant women. Antibiotic resistance Resistance to tetracycline and other antimicrobial agents among V. cholerae has been demonstrated in both endemic and epidemic cholera settings. Resistance can be acquired through the accumulation of selected mutations over time, or the acquisition of genetic elements such as plasmids, introns, or conjugative elements, which confer rapid spread of resistance. A likely risk factor for antimicrobial resistance is widespread use of antibiotics, including mass distribution for prophylaxis in asymptomatic individuals. Antibiotic resistance emerged in previous epidemics in the context of antibiotic prophylaxis for household contacts of cholera patients 17, 18. Unanswered questions Inadequate information still exists with respect to antibiotics in the following areas: Effect of antibiotics on secondary transmission: There are insufficient data examining the effect of antibiotics on secondary transmission of cholera. However, in published studies to date antibiotics have not been shown to decrease secondary transmission of cholera within households 19, 20. Utility of antibiotics when aggressive rehydration is not possible: Because studies on antibiotic treatment for cholera were conducted in patients who received adequate rehydration, the effect of antibiotics in settings where this is not possible remains unclear. Summary of Antibiotic Treatment Guidelines Various organizations that participate in cholera responses recommend the use of antibiotics in cholera-infected patients with moderate or severe illness and who have begun IV hydration. None of the guidelines recommend antibiotics as prophylaxis for cholera prevention, and all emphasize that antibiotics should be used in conjunction with aggressive hydration. In addition, the guidelines recommend that antimicrobial susceptibility testing should inform local drug choices. Available guidelines are summarized below. Guidelines for Cholera Treatment with Antibiotics Organization Recommendation First-line drug choice Alternate drug choices Drug choices for special populations World Health Organization 21 Antibiotic treatment for cholera patients with severe dehydration only Doxycycline Tetracycline Erythromycin is recommended drug for children Pan American Health Organization 22 Antibiotic treatment for cholera patients with moderate or severe dehydration Doxycycline Ciprofloxacin Azithromycin Erythromycin or azithromycin recommended as first-line drugs for pregnant women and children Ciprofloxacin and doxycycline recommended as second-line drugs for children International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh23 Antibiotic treatment for cholera patients with some or severe dehydration Doxycycline Ciprofloxacin Azithromycin Cotrimoxazole Erythromycin recommended as first-line drug for children and pregnant women Medicins Sans Frontieres 24 Antibiotic treatment for severely dehydrated patients only Doxycycline Erythromycin Cotrimoxazole Chloramphenicol Furazolidone * Please note, due to space constraints, dosage information is not included in this table. Dosage guidance can be found by following the website links to the treatment guidance documents provided in the references section below 21-24. Considerations Over-emphasizing antibiotics for treatment of cholera could divert resources from oral and intravenous rehydration. Doxycycline costs approximately $0.02 per 100mg tablet. Azithromycin costs approximately $0.16 per 250mg tablet. Antibiotics can cause nausea and vomiting. Gastrointestinal side effects should be carefully monitored, especially in dehydrated patients. Antibiotics are not needed and should not be given to patients with cholera who have only mild or no diarrhea and dehydration. Prospective surveillance for antibiotic resistance among bacterial isolates from any outbreak is essential for understanding and minimizing the spread of resistance.",

This results from the dilated left subclavian artery and dilated post stenotic aorta indenting the barium filled oesophagus.Coarctation of the aortais produced by a deformity of the aortic media and intima. which causes a prominent posterior infolding of the aortic lumen.This deformity characteristically occurs at or near the junction of the aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta.Cystic medial necrosis is a common occurrence at the level of coarctation and may predispose the aorta to infective endarteritis, intimal dissection, and aneurysm.Coarctation of the aorta accounts for 5% -10% of congenital cardiac lesions.It occurs with increased frequency among patients with Turner syndrome. 20%-36% of whom are affected.Clinical manifestations vary from congestive heart failure in infancy to hypertension with differential pressures between the upper and lower extremities in adulthood.Two classic radiologic signs associated with aortic coarctation are the figure-of-three sign and the reverse figure-of-three sign.The aortic segment affected by coarctation has a shape that resembles the number 3 on frontal chest radiographs.The number 3 is formed by dilatation of the left subclavian artery and aorta proximal to the site of coarctation, indentation of the site, and dilatation of the aorta distal to the site.This sign is seen in 50%-66% of adults with aortic coarctation.The reverse figure-of-threesign. a mirror image of the number 3, is observedon the left anterior oblique view during bariumesophagography in patients with aortic coarctation.Common radiologic signs in Congenital Heart DiseaseTransposition of Great arteriesEgg on side or Apple on a string apoearanceTotal anomalous pulmonary venous return5nowman or Figure of esght appearancePartial anomalous pulmonary venous returnScimitar signTetralogy of FallotBoot shaped HeartEbstein's anomalyBox shaped heartEndocardial Cushion defectGoose neck sign",

Guyton 11th/986; Ganong 23rd/ pg. 390-392) Guyton Physiology 11th/pg. 986............. \"PIH has two effects on bone in causing absorption of calcium and phosphate. One is a rapid phase that begins in minutes and increases progressively for several hours.. This phase results from activation of the already existing bone cells (mainly the osteocytes) to promote calcium and phosphate absorption. The second phase is a much slower one, requiring several days or even weeks to become fully developed; it results from the proliferation of the osteoclasts, followed by greatly increased osteoclastic reabsorption of the bone itself, not merely absorption of the calcium phosphate salts from the bone.\" Parathyroid hormone (PTH) # PTH, secreted by the chief cells of the parathyroid gland, is essential for life. # PTH has a direct effect on the bone to increase bone resorption and mobilize Ca2+; this effect is mediated by increasing intracellular cAMP levels in osteoblasts. # PTH also increases calcium absorption from the gut, although that effect is the result of PTH-mediated increases in renal 1,2,5-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol. PTH has a phosphaturic action due to a decrease in phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubules. # Thus, The main function of the parathyroid gland is to maintain a constant ionized calcium level in the extracellular fluid. To do this, PTH stimulates increased plasma calcium levels, chiefly by mobilizing calcium from bones, although PTH can also increase renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and intestinal absorption of calcium. # PTH increases Ca2+ reabsorption from the thick ascending limb and the distal convoluted tubule. # Although most of the filtered Ca2+ is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, the regulation of Ca2+ excretion occurs in the thick ascending limb and the distal convoluted tubule. PTH regulates the reabsorption of HP042? in the proximal tubule. # PTH is released from the parathyroid gland in response to lowered plasma Ca2+ concentrations. In addition to inhibiting the reabsorption of phosphate from the proximal tubule, PTH increases the reabsorption of Ca2+ from the loop of Henle. # The secretion of PTH is inversely related to the circulating levels of ionized calcium.",

Clinical manifestations of TB in children y The majority of children with tuberculosis infection develop no signs or symptoms at any level. y Occasionally, infection is marked by low-grade fever, mild cough, malaise and flu-like symptoms. A) Primary pulmonary disease The lung is the portal of entry in > 98% of cases. The primary complex of tuberculosis includes local infection at the portal of entry and regional lymph nodes that drain the area. The combination of the parenchymal pulmonary'- lesion and corresponding lymph node is called Ghon complex. Asymptomatic pleural effusion is so frequent in primary- tuberculosis that it is basically a component of the primary complex. - Nelson It may have one of the following course : - Heating by fibrosis and calcification. Progressive primary> tuberculosis. Cavity' Obstructive emphycema y If incomplete obstruction is caused by lymph nodes. Resorption atelectesis y If complete obstruction is caused by lymph nodes.

Miliary tuberculosis Collapse consolidation (segmental lesion) A combination of pneumonitis and atelectasis. B) Chronic pulmonary tuberculosis #Infrequent in young children # Children above the age of seven years, especially girls are more vulnerable. #Commonest site of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is the apex of lung Puhl's lesion. #Infraclavicular lesion of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is called Assman's focus. #Regional lymph nodes are not involved in chronic pulmonary TB (in contrast to primary TB). Lab investigations of pediatric TB o ESR and blood counts : No value in diagnosis or follow up of TB. o Demonstration of AFB : o Children don't expectorate out sputum, but swallow it. Therefore sputum is not available for examination. o A laryngeal swab may be obtained for smear and culture examination for mycobacteria o It is customer}' to examine the gastric lavage in children for bacteriological examination on 3 consecutive days, o Aspiration of early morning gastric contents (before breakfast) is done with a ryle's tube and sent for bacteriological examination. Adding vancomycin to the sample improves the yield of mycobacterium. o The CSF, Pleural fluid or bronchial aspirate, urine and discharges from tuberculous sinuses are examined for tubercle bacilli. o Histopathology : Material for histopathology may be obtained by biopsy or FNAC. o PCR : High sensitivity and specificity for pleural fluid and low for gastric aspirate, o CXR and CT may show characterstic features. o USG may be helpful for detection of enlarged abdominal lymph nodes, o Serology : Elisa or other methods have no utility in pediatric TB.

Thus total 9 ATP molecules are produced and 2 are utilized, i.e., There is a net gain of 7 ATP molecules in aerobic glycolysisQ. o In anaerobic conditions, the reoxidation of NADH by electron transport chain is prevented and NADH gets reoxidized by conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Thus, in anaerobic glycolysis, only 4 ATP are produced at substrate level. Therefore, there is a net gain of 2 ATP molecules in anaerobic glycolysisQ. o Note: - Previous calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH2 generates 2 ATPs. This will amount to a net generation of 8ATPs per glucose molecule during glycolysis.

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4. At the District Hospital level5. Mental Hospital and teaching Psychiatric Units District Mental Health Programme Components 1. Training programmes of all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State.2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma.3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided.4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions. The National Human Rights Commission also monitors the conditions in the mental hospitals along with the government of India and the states are currently acting on the recommendation of the joint studies conducted to ensure quality in the delivery of mental care. Thrust areas for 10th Five Year Plan 1. District mental health programme in an enlarged and more effective form covering the entire country.2. Streamlining/ modernization of mental hospitals in order to modify their present custodial role.3. Upgrading the department of psychiatry in medical colleges and enhancing the psychiatry content of the medical curriculum at the undergraduate as well as postgraduate level.4. Strengthening the Central and State Mental Health Authorities with a permanent secretariat. Appointment of medical officers at state headquarters in order to make their monitoring role more effective;5. Research and training in the field of community mental health, substance abuse and child/ adolescent psychiatric clinics.",

USG for fetal cardiac activity: At 6 weeks it is routine to detect fetal cardiac activity by ultrasound (and Doppler is not indicated). Doppler is most sensitive but not safe in early pregnancy Doppler examination of fetal vessels in early pregnancy should not be performed without a clinical indication- Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 2011; 37:625-628 Week 6 - Gestational Age (Fetal age 4 weeks) 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 weeks is usually a very good time to detect either a fetal pole or even a fetal heart-beat by vaginal ultrasound. The fetal pole is the first visible sign of a developing embryo. The fetal pole now allows for crown to rump measurements (CRL) to be taken, so that pregnancy dating can be a bit more accurate. The fetal pole may be seen at a crown-rump length (CRL) of 2-4 mm, and the heartbeat may be seen as a regular flutter when the CRL has reached 5 mm. If a vaginal ultrasound is done and no fetal pole or cardiac activity is seen, another ultrasound scan should be done in 3-7 days.

        "exp": "Ans- D Definitive repair of injury Damage Control Surgery Craig Olson MD, Alexander L. Eastman MD, in Parkland Trauma Handbook (Third Edition), 2009 IV. Stages of Damage Control Damage control surgery (DCS) is divided into four distinctive stages: the decision to perform DCS, the operation, intensive care unit resuscitation, and second-look/definitive operation. A. Decision to perform DCS 1.Preoperative decision to perform a DCS procedure is frequently made in patients with multisystem trauma. 2.Absolute indications for DCS: a.Base deficit >8 mEq/L or worsening base deficit b.pH < 7.2 c.Hypotension < 90 mm Hg systolic d.Hypothermia < 34deg C e.PTT > 60 seconds f.Operative \"clinical\" coagulopathy 3.Early recognition of significant physiologic derangement and the need for DCS are critical as inability to correct pH >7.21 and PTT >70 is associated with near certain mortality. 4.Initial resuscitation should begin in the emergency department and continue in the operating room following correction of deficit and using a massive transfusion program as indicated. B.DCS operative principles 1.The goal of DCS is a short operating time, followed by transport to an intensive care unit. 2.Control of hemorrhage a.Ligation of named vascular structures may be necessary and/or temporary vascular clamps may be used. b.Vascular shunting may be employed in extremities using surgical shunts, such as a Javid shunt or large-bore IV tubing. c.Abdominal packing: packs are inserted into the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, and pelvis. The bowel should be separated from laparotomy pads. 3.Control of contamination a.Bowel injuries may be quickly closed or resected with stapled ends left in discontinuity. b.Delay definitive repair of injury including time-consuming anastomoses and ostomies. 4.Prevent hypothermia. a.Warm operating room. b.All resuscitation fluids and blood products must be warmed to 38.0o C or higher. c.Continuous use of convective warming devices (e.g., Bair huggers) 5.Temporary abdominal closure (TAC) a. Allows \"easy access\" for planned next operative intervention b. At Parkland Memorial Hospital, the \"Vac-Pack\" dressing is employed by packing the abdomen with laparotomy pads separated from the bowel with a fluid-impervious layer (e.g., a \"bogota bag or bowel bag). TAC dressing-specific drains are then placed in the packing, and a seal is created over the wound with the use of Ioban dressing. These drains are then connected to wall suction. (Note: Commercially available dressings have been made that accomplish the same goal with less \"improvisation\" but they are not as cost-effective.) c. Additional abdominal drains may be used as well. d. Because of its ease of application, the Vac-Pack dressing allows bedside changes in the intensive care unit. 6. Angiography/embolization a. If pelvic bleeding is suspected, the patient may be transferred to the angiography suite at this time. Significant hepatic parenchymal hemorrhage may also be controlled with angiography. C. Restoration of homeostasis in the intensive care unit 1. Rewarming a. Warm room temperature and other convective measures of warming, such as warming blankets and lamps, are used to maintain body temperature >35o C. b. Use of fluid warmer for administration of resuscitative crystalloids and blood products is mandatory. c. Continuous arteriovenous rewarming (CAVR) is occasionally performed when body temperature is less than 35o C. 2. Careful fluid resuscitation a. Resuscitation may be guided by early use of a pulmonary artery catheter. b.If massive bleeding resumes, the patient is returned emergently to the operating room for cessation of likely surgical bleeding. c.Avoid over-resuscitation. d.Monitor bladder pressure. Bladder pressures >20 mm Hg should raise concern for intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and >30 mm Hg for abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). 3.Ventilatory support a.If possible, maintain tidal volumes at 6 mL/kg ideal body weight. b.If unable to oxygenate with conventinal ventilation, at Parkland Memorial Hospital we use the Volume Diffuse Respirator (VDR) as a salvage therapy. 4.Negative fluid balance a.When physiologic balance is restored, natural mobilization of third space fluids may be aided with a continuous furosemide drip, titrated to a net negative balance per hour. b.This facilitates abdominal wall closure. C.Definitive operative intervention 1. Ideally performed at 24 to 36 hours, later if indications of physiologic derangement persist 2.Removal of packs, with replacement if necessary 3.Secondary survey of the abdomen: missed injuries at the time of damage control surgery are not uncommon. 4.Restoration of gastrointestinal and vascular continuity if necessary 5.Performance of other definitive procedures, such as ostomy placement 6.Abdominal closure if possible. If bowel edema prevents this, several techniques (e.g., Wittman patch) can be employed to help reapproximate fascial edges in stages. 7.Multiple \"second-looks\" may be needed.",

It is specialized for the function of reception, integration and transmission of information in the body. The basic structure of the neuron is best studied in a spinal motor neuron. This cell has a ''cell body (soma)' with 5-7 small processes called 'dendrites'. There is a long process called 'axon' that originate from \"axon hillock (A thickened area of cell body from %vhich axon originates)\". The first portion of the axon is called \"initial segment\". In a motor neuron, the axon hillock and the initial segment of axon have the lowest threshold for excitation. This is because they have a much higher density of voltage-gated sodium channels. o Functionally speaking, the neuron can be divided into four zones : - Dendrites and Soma (cell body) - Receptor zone Axon hillock of body & initial segment of axon - Generator area (Nerve impulse is generated). Axon (main length) - Transmitter zone (Transmits nerve impulse). The nerve terminals (Terminal knobs or buttons) : - Release zone (release neurotransmitters).",

In addition, while erect, the more negative intrapleural pressure at the apex causes the overstretched alveoli in this region to resist further stretch more strongly; i.e., the compliance of the alveoli is less at the apex than at the base. Consequently, about four times more gas goes to the base than to the apex. Most of the gas exchange in the lungs takes place at the base when the thorax is erect because the base is the place where most of the blood and gas are located.

Ordinarily, no transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule can recognize a nonsense co\u00addon; therefore, protein synthesis terminates when the ribosome reaches such a codon. A nonsense suppressor mutation usually involves the mutation of a tRNA gene, so that the anticodon of the tRNA is altered to a sequence that is complementary to a nonsense codon. The altered tRNA can then bind to the nonsense codon and insert an amino acid at that point in the protein sequence. Thus, protein synthesis is allowed to continue, and the nonsense mutation is suppressed.\nA silent mutation is one that causes no change in the amino acid sequence of a protein.

        "question": "Which of the following enzyme does not catalyze the irreversible step in glycolysis -",
        "exp": "Ans- B Glycolysis (Embden Meyerh of Pathway) Definition: Glycolysis is a process by which glucose molecules are metabolized through a series of enzymatic reactions into 2 molecules of pyruvate. Site Of GlycolysisCytosol Purpose: Aerobic glycolysis produces 7 moles of ATP per mole of glucose and 2 moles of pyruvate (Ref: Harper 28th edition, pg 155) Anaerobic glycolysis produces 2 moles of ATP per mole of glucose and 2 moles of lactate. Tissues Dependent On Glycolysis: Erythrocytes, cornea, lens, kidney medulla. Irreversible Reactions Of Glycolysis are: Hexokinase and Glucokinase Have Different Properties Four different isoenzymes of hexokinase (I, II, III, and IV) are expressed in a tissue - specific manner in the body. The hexokinase isoenzymes found in most tissues (I, II, and III) have a low Km, for glucose (<0.1 mM) relative to its concentration in blood (~ 5 mM) and are strongly inhibited by the product glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). The latter is important as it prevents hexokinase from tying up all of the inorganic phosphate of a cell in the form of phosphorylated hexoses. Although the hexokinase reaction is not at equilibrium because of the inhibition imposed by G6P, the level at which hexokinase is expressed in cells can have a major impact on the rate of glycolysis in cells. Liver parenchymal cells and b cells of pancreas are unique in that they contain hexokinase isoenzyme IV, usually called glucokinase, which has strikingly different kinetic properties. Glucokinase catalyzes ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose like other hexokinase, but its S0.5 (Substrate concentration that gives enzyme activity of one half maximum velocity) for glucose is considerably higher than the Km for glucose of the other hexokinases. Furthermore, glucokinase is much less sensitive to product inhibition by G6P, and its glucose saturation curve is sigmoidal, which is indicative of cooperativity. Important Enzymes Of Glycolysis are: Difference between Hexokinase and Glucokinase: Hexokinase Glucokinase 1. Site 2. Substrate 3. Induction 4. Km for glucose 5. Inhibition by glucose-6-phosphate 6. Effect of feeding and insulin All tissues except liver Glucose, fructose or galactose. Non inducible Low Inhibited No change in activity Only in liver Only glucose Inducible High Not inhibited Increased rate. Hexokinase II And Cancer As a rule rapidly growing cancers metabolize glucose faster than normal cells, at least in part because overexpression of hexokinase II gives cancer cells greater enzymatic capacity for glucose phosphorylation. On top of this, tight binding of hexokinase II to the mitochondrial outer membrane provides the enzyme with first dibs for the ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation. Phosphofructokinase: Major regulatory enzyme of glycolysis Activators of PFK: AMP; F6P; F2,6-BP; Inhibitors of PFK: ATP, citrate Enolase: Enzyme is inhibited by sodium fluoride Embden-Meyerhof pathway Fructose 2,6-Bisphosphate Plays a Unique Role in the Regulation of Glycolysis & Gluconeogenesis in Liver. Comment Energetics of Glycolysis During glycolysis 2 ATP are utilized and 4 ATP are produced at substrate level. 2 reducing equalents NADH+ are produced and reoxidized by electron transport chain, to generate 5 ATP molecules (2.5 ATP per NADH+ molecule). Thus total 9 ATP molecules are produced and 2 are utilized, i.e., There is net gain of 7 ATP molecules in aerobic glycolysis. In anaerobic conditions, the reoxidation of NADH by electron transport chain is prevented and NADH gets reoxidized by conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Thus, in anaerobic glycolysis only 4 ATP are produced at substrate level. Therefore, there is net gain of 2 ATP molecules in anaerobic glycolysis. Note: - Previous calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH2 generates 2 ATPs. This will amount to a net generation of 8ATPs per glucose molecule during glycolysis. Recent experiments show that these old values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH2 produces 1.5 ATPs. Thus, net generation is only 7 ATPs during glycolysis. Reaction Enzyme No of ATPs gained (new calculation) No of ATPs gained (old calculations) Glucose - Glucose-6-phosphate Hexokinase, glucokinase - 1 - 1 Fructose-6-p -Fructose -1,6-bisphosphate Hexokinase, glucokinase - 1 - 1 Glyceraldehyde-3-P - 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate Glyceraldehyde-3-P, dehydrogenase + 5 (2.5 X 2 NADH) +6 (3.0 X 2 NADH) 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate - 3-phosphoglycerate Phosphoenol pyruvate - Pyruvate Phosphoglycerate mutase +2 +2 +2 +2 o Net generation in aerobic glycolysis Pyruvate kinase 9 - 2 = 7 10 - 2 = 8 Comment Important Points The most potent positive allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase-1 and inhibitor of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase in liver is fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. It relieves inhibition of phosphofructokinase-1 by ATP and increases the affinity for fructose 6-phosphate. It inhibits fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase by increasing the Km for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Its concentration is under both substrate (allosteric) and hormonal control (covalent modification) Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is formed by phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate by phosphofructokinase-2. The same enzyme protein is also responsible for its breakdown, since it has fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase activity. This bifunctional enzyme is under the allosteric control of fructose 6-phosphate, which stimulates the kinase and inhibits the phosphatase. When there is an abundant supply of glucose, the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate increases, stimulating glycolysis by activating phosphofructokinase-1 and inhibiting fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. In the fasting state, glucagon stimulates the production of cAMP, activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which in turn inactivates phosphofructokinase-2 and activates fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase by phosphorylation. Hence, gluconeogenesis is stimulated by a decrease in the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, which inactivates phosphofructokinase-1 and relieves the inhibition of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase.",

        "exp": "Ans. (c) Coarctation of aorta. Coarctation of aorta Ref- Image Source- Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) refers to a narrowing of the aortic lumen. Epidemiology Coarctations account for between 5-8% of all congenital heart defects. They are more frequent in males, M:F ratio of ~2-3:1. Clinical presentation Varies accordingly to the degree of stenosis and the associated abnormalities. Patients may be asymptomatic in a setting of a non-severe stenosis. Children and adults can present with angina pectoris and leg claudication. On clinical examination, diminished femoral pulses and differential blood pressure between upper and lower extremities may be noted. Pathology It can be primarily divided into two types: infantile (pre-ductal) form: is characterised by diffuse hypoplasia or narrowing of the aorta from just distal to the brachiocephalic artery to the level of ductus arteriosus, typically with a more discrete area of constriction just proximal to the ductus but distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. Therefore, the blood supply to the descending aorta is via the patent ductus arteriosus. adult (juxta-ductal, post-ductal or middle aortic) form: is characterised by a short segment abrupt stenosis of the post-ductal aorta. It is due to thickening of the aortic media and typically occurs just distal to the ligamentum arteriosum (a remnant of the ductus arteriosus). Associations As with many congenital abnormalities, coarctation of the aorta is associated with other congenital anomalies. cardiac: bicuspid aortic valve: most common associated defect and seen in 75-80% ventricular septal defect (VSD) cyanotic congenital lesions including truncus arteriosus transposition of the great arteries (TGA), especially with a sub-pulmonic VSD and overriding pulmonary artery (Taussig-Bing) mitral valve defects including hypoplastic mitral valve parachute mitral valve abnormal papillary muscles patent ductus arteriosus non cardiac: intracranial berry aneurysms spinal scoliosis syndromic associations: cardiac Shone syndrome wider syndromic PHACE syndrome Turner syndrome: a coarctation can be seen in 15-20% of those with Turner syndrome Radiographic features Plain radiograph figure of 3 sign: contour abnormality of the aorta inferior rib notching: Roesler sign secondary to dilated intercostal collateral vessels which form as a way to bypass the coarctation and supply the descending aorta the dilated and tortuous vessels erode the inferior margins of the ribs, resulting in notching seen only in long standing cases, and therefore not seen in infancy (unusual in patients <5 years of age)7 seen in 70% of cases presenting in older children or adults if the coarctation is distal to either subclavian artery, then increased flow occurs through the subclavian artery, forming a collateral pathway via the internal thoracic artery, anterior intercostal artery, posterior intercostal artery and then into the descending thoracic aorta usually the 4th to 8th ribs are involved; occasionally involves the 3rd to 9th ribs as the 1st and 2nd posterior intercostal arteries arise from the costocervical trunk (a branch of the subclavian artery) and do not communicate with the aorta, these are not involved in collateral formation, and the 1st and 2nd ribs do not become notched if bilateral rib notching: the coarctation must be distal to the origin of both subclavian arteries, to enable bilateral collaterals to form if unilateral right rib notching then the coarctation lies distal to the brachiocephalic trunk, but proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery or there may be a right sided aortic arch with abberent left subclavian artery distal to coarctation collaterals cannot form on the left, as the left subclavian is distal to the coarctation if unilateral left rib notching, then this suggests an associated aberrant right subclavian artery arising after the coarctation. The coarctation is distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, therefore collaterals form on the left. Collaterals cannot form on the right, as the aberrant right subclavian artery arises after the coarctation Antenatal ultrasound Useful in assessing for infantile coarctations. The suprasternal notch-long axis views are particularly considered helpful. The fetal right ventricle can be appear enlarged in severe coarctations although this alone is not a specific feature. Occasionally an aortic arch view may directly show a narrowing. Angiography: CTA/MRA/DSA All modalities are capable of delineating the coarctation as well as collateral vessels, most common collateral pathway being subclavian artery to internal mammary artery to intercostal arteries (resulting in inferior rib notching) to post-coarctation part of descending thoracic aorta. Treatment and prognosis The urgency of treatment depends on the presence of congestive cardiac failure. This is usually the case in severe coarctations found in infancy. In less severe cases, elective treatment when the child is older (typically ~2 years of age) is preferred 3. Treatment can be either primary surgical repair with excision of the coarctation and end-to-end anastomosis, or balloon angioplasty. Subclavian flap repair is a common surgical technique used, where the origin and proximal left subclavian artery is excised, opened up and sutured onto the aorta. If the subclavian is ligated, it is usually anastomosed onto the left common carotid artery. Complications neonatal heart failure subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured berry aneurysm aortic dissection infective endocarditis: in the context of an added infective insult mycotic aneurysm: in the context of an added infective insult Differential diagnosis Imaging differential considerations include: pseudo-coarctation of the aorta: elongation, narrowing or kinking with no pressure gradient or collateral formation, no rib notching chronic large vessel arteritis, e.g. chronic phase of Takayasu arteritis",

It is nothing else but filtered HCO3- ions which react with H+ to form H2CO3- This is the most important buffer in proximal tubules. Phosphate buffer : - Especially important in distal tubules. Ammonia buffers : - Bind to H+ and produce ammonium ion (H+ + NH3 = NH4). The reaction with NH3 occurs in the proximal and distal tubules but the main buffering mechanism is active in distal tubule and this is the most important buffer in distal tubule. o Thus, these buffers neutralize H+ in the tubules and in exchange HCO3- is reabsorbed. In case of bicarbonate buffer all filtered bicarbonates are reabsorbed. In case of ammonia and phosphate buffers, new HCO3 is generated due to secretion of H+ So, ammonia and phosphate buffers are excreted in exchange of HCO3- absorption.",

        "question": "Absorption of which of the following antimalarial drugs increases with food intake?",
        "exp": "Ans. a (Mefloquine) (Ref. KDT 6'h/787; Goodmann Gilllman Pharmacology, Chapter 39). Psychosis and seizures occur rarely, and mefloquine should not be prescribed to patients with neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia, and seizure disorder. Antimalarial drugs 1. Suppressive (to avoid infection) 2. Therapeutic (eliminate erythrocytic) 3. Radical cure (elimination exoerythrocytic) 4. Gametocidal (destruction of gametocytes) Successful treatment is accomplished with chloroquine followed by primaquine. Chloroquine therapy is suppressive, therapeutic, and gametocidal, whereas primaquine eliminates the exoerythrocytic form. MEFLOQUINE # Like quinine and chloroquine, this quinoline is active only against the asexual erythrocytic stages of malarial parasites. # It has been the antimalarial prophylactic agent of choice for much of the tropics because it is usually effective against multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria and is reasonably well tolerated. # Mefloquine's mode of action is similar to that of chloroquine. # The presence of food significantly enhances the rate and extent of absorption. # About 98% of the drug binds to protein. # Mefloquine is excreted mainly in the bile and feces; no dose adjustment is needed in persons with renal insufficiency. # Adverse effects: - Mefloquine should be used with caution in individuals participating in activities requiring alertness and fine-motor coordination (e.g., driving, piloting aircraft, operating machinery, and deep-sea diving). - Sleep abnormalities (insomnia, abnormal dreams) have occasionally been reported. - Halofantrine must not be given simultaneously with or <3 weeks after mefloquine because a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval on electrocardiography may occur. - Caution should be exercised with regard to concomitant antiretroviral therapy, since mefloquine has been shown to exert variable effects on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. - Women of childbearing age are encouraged to practice contraception during malaria prophylaxis with mefloquine and for up to 3 months thereafter. ATOVAQUONE # Absorption after a single oral dose is slow, erratic, and variable; increased two- to threefold by fatty food; and dose- limited above 750 mg. CHLOROQUINE # It has marked, rapid schizontocidal and gametocidal activity against blood forms of P. ovale and Plasmodium malariae and against susceptible strains of P. vivax and P. falciparum. # It is not active against intrahepatic forms (P vivax and P ovale). # Hydroxychloroquine, a congener of chloroquine, is preferred to chloroquine for the treatment of autoimmune disorders because it produces less ocular toxicity when used in high doses. # Chloroquine can be administered intravenously, but excessively rapid parenteral administration can result in seizures and death from cardiovascular collapse. # About half of the drug is excreted in urine, but dose not reduced for persons with acute malaria and renal insufficiency. ARTEMISININ DERIVATIVES (THE NOVEL ANTI-MALARIALS) # Artesunate, artemether, arteether, and the parent compound artemisinin are sesquiterpene lactones derived from the wormwood plant Artemisia annua. (Chinese drugs). # These are rapidly effective against multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria and are at least as effective as and considerably safer than quinine or quinidine. # These agents are at least ten-fold more potent in vivo than other antimalarial drugs and presently show no cross- resistance with known antimalarials; thus they have become first-line treatments for severe falciparum malaria in areas where multidrug resistance is a major problem. # Artemether appears to be effective for the treatment of schistosomiasis and is being evaluated for community-based treatment programs. # When these agents are used alone, recrudescence may occur. LUMEFANTRINE # Has marked blood schizontocidal activity against a wide range of plasmodia with lower recrudescence rate. # The pharmacokinetic properties of lumefantrine are reminiscent of those of halofantrine, with variable oral bioavailability, considerable augmentation of oral bioavailability by concomitant fat intake, and a terminal elimination half-life of ~4 to 5 days in patients with malaria.

When a woman present with menorrhagia, consideration must first be given to diagnosis.This requires an appropriate history and clinical examination completed by the suitable investigation.Anemia should be detected by full blood count and iron studies.Ultrasonography, sonohysterography, and hysteroscopy are additional investigations that may diagnose a structural problem and should be utilized depending on their availability and the experience of the surgeon.Common causes of menorrhagia include local pathologies such as fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis or infection.Rarer, but important causes include genital malignancy (cervical, endometrial or myometrial) and systemic disorders such as thyroid disease and bleeding disorders.In over 50% cases no cause is found and the diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is made.Dysfunctional uterine bleeding requires the following criteria: -Complaint of excessive menstrual blood loss (menorrhagia).Adequate exclusion of pathology that may otherwise cause menorrhagia.Dysfunctional uterine bleeding may be ovulatory or nonovulatory.Anovulatory cycles result in menorrhagia with regular cycles were asOvulatory cycles result in menorrhagia with irregular cycles.Most of the cases of dysfunctional uterine bleeding are secondary to anovulation.Without ovulation, the corpus luteum fails to form resulting in no progesterone secretion.In the absence of progesterone, there is no lateral phase or the secretory phase.The anovulatory woman is always in the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle and in the proliferative phase of the endometrial cycle.The only ovarian steroidal signal the endometrium receives is through estrogen.Continuous stimulation of endometrium by estrogen produces a proliferation of the endometrium to abnormal levels where it becomes fragile without the growth limiting and organizing effect of progesterone.The endometrium finally outgrows its blood supply and degenerates. The end result is an asynchronous breakdown of the endometrial lining at different levels.We can conclude that bleeding in anovulatory cycle occurs due to unopposed action of estrogen in the absence of progesterone.Anovulatory menstrual cycle gives rise to irregular bleeding.On the other hand, ovulatory cycles give rise to regular menstrual bleeding.These patients ovulate regularly. These patients have both the phases of menstrual cycle i.e., follicular phase and the secretory phase.Research has shown that several abnormalities can occur in the endometrium of women with DUB's ovulary cycles, for example, increased fibrinolytic activity and increased production of prostaglandins.These observations provide the rational basis for treatment in these women i.e.,Antifibrinolytic Tranexamic acidProstaglandin inhibitor acidManagement of dysfunctional uterine bleeding.In D.U.B's there is no specific abnormality present, therefore, the choice of t/t must be considered in relation to several factors: -Factors influencing t/tPresence of ovulatory or anovulatory cycles.Need for contraceptionPatient preferenceContraindication to t/tHeavy periods |Require contraceptionYes -Combined oral contraceptive or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systemNo |Regular cyclesNo-Combined oral contraceptives or cyclical progestinsYes |Dysmenorrhea significant symptomsYes-Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugsNo | Tranexamic acid Medical treatment can be conveniently divided into hormonal and non hormonal: -As there is no hormonal defect the use of hormonal therapy does not correct an underlying disorder but merely imposes an external control of the cycle.The two main first-line t/t for menorrhagias associated with ovulatory cycles are nonhormonal as the ovulatory cycles usually have no defect in the menstrual cycle.They have normal menstruation and regular cycle the abnormality usually lies in increased fibrinolysis and increased production of prostaglandin.First line drugs in ovulatory cycles (menorrhagia with regular cycles)Antifibrinolytic Q (Tranexamic acid)NSAIDSTranexamic acid reduces menstrual loss by half and NSAID reduces it by one third.Both have the advantages of only being taken during menstruation, and aid to compliance and are particularly useful in those women who either do not require contraception or do not wish to use a hormonal therapy.They are also of value in treating excessive menstrual blood loss associated with the use of the nonhormonal intrauterine contraceptive device.Hormonal therapy Progesterone Traditionally hormonal therapy for menorrhagia has been progesterone given during luteal phase of the cycle.Normally progesterone therapy will control anovulatory bleeding once uterine pathology is excluded.In women who do not ovulate but are more frankly hypogonadal cyclic progesterone therapy restores the normal sequence of steroid hormone stimulation, estrogen followed by estrogen plus progesterone followed by withdrawal bleeding.Progestins are usually not effective.Despite this, they remain the first choice of many general practitioners and gynecologists.Progesterone's are effective when given for 21 days in each cycle but the side effects are such that patient may not choose to continue with the t/t.Although progestins have the contraceptive effect they are not the best choice when contraception required. Combined contraceptive pillThey are popular first-line drugs for women who desire contraception.OCP's suppress pituitary gonadotropin release preventing ovulation.Like cyclical progestins, they are useful for anovulatory bleeding as they impose a cycle.Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (MIRENA)It is a T shaped intrauterine device which releases levonorgestrel at the rate of 20 mcg daily.This low hormone minimizes the systemic progestin side effects and more patients will continue this therapy than cyclic progesterone's.It exerts its clinical effect by preventing endometrial proliferation and consequently reduces both the duration of bleeding and the amount of menstrual loss.The levonorgestrel-releasing system is also advocated as an alternative to surgery. Endometrial ablation Vs Levonorgestrel IVDFor women who wish to stop using chronic medical therapy or have contraindications to medications, minimally invasive options include the LNG-IUD or endometrial ablation.A systematic review of six randomized trials and a subsequent randomized trial found that women with menorrhagia who were treated with either the LNG-IUD or endometrial ablation had similar reductions in menstrual blood loss at 6, 12, and 24 months, as well as similar improvements in quality of life.A meta-analysis of four randomized trials found that rates of dissatisfaction were similar for women treated with the LNG-IUD (17 percent) compared with endometrial ablation (18 percent) (OR 0.9, 95% Cl 0.5-1.8).The decision to use the LNG-IUD or endometrial ablation depends upon a patient's preferences regarding treatment at 6, 12, and 24 months, as well as similar improvements in quality of life.factors such as plans for fertility and contraception, convenience, and risks of anesthesia.- The LNG-IUD is a reversible contraceptive. - Pregnancy is contraindicated after endometrial ablation. but the procedure does not prevent pregnancy: thus. women will need to continue to use contraception following ablation. The LNG-IUD can be placed in an office setting for all women and requires no or local anesthesia.Endometrial ablation can also be done in an office by surgeons who are appropriately equipped but is often performed in an operating room under general anesthesia.If successful, endometrial ablation is performed once, while the LNG-IUD needs to be replaced every five.",

        "exp": "Ans- C Ref- Osteopetrosis, also known as Albers-Schonberg disease or marble bone disease, is an uncommon hereditary disorder that results from defective osteoclasts. Bones become sclerotic and thick, but their abnormal structure actually causes them to be weak and brittle. There are two separate subtypes of osteopetrosis: infantile autosomal recessive osteopetrosis benign adult autosomal dominant osteopetrosis Clinical presentation Presentation, in the majority of cases, is with a fracture due to the weakened bones. Fractures are often transverse with multiple areas of callus formation and normal healing. Additionally, there is crowding of the marrow, so bone marrow function is affected resulting in myelophthisic anaemia and extramedullary haematopoiesis with splenomegaly. This may terminate in acute leukaemia. Pathology Both forms are congenital abnormalities with localised chromosomal defects. These result in defective osteoclasts and overgrowth of bone. The bones become thick and sclerotic, but their increased thickness does not improve their strength. Instead, their disordered architecture results in weak and brittle bones. The osteoclasts lack carbonic anhydrase, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Radiographic features The features are dependent on the subtype of osteopetrosis and are detailed in the individual articles: infantile autosomal recessive osteopetrosis benign adult autosomal dominant osteopetrosis Treatment and prognosis Treatment is with bone marrow transplant and resultant normalisation of bone production. Prognosis for the autosomal dominant adult subtype is good with a normal life expectancy. However, the autosomal recessive infantile subtype can result in stillbirth or death in infancy, with few patients living past middle age. History and etymology The term is derived from the Greek words 'osteo' meaning bone and 'petros' meaning stone. It was first described by German radiologist Heinrich Albers-Schonberg (1865-1921) in 1904 4.

The chief sources of infection are shedding human lesions, fomites contaminated from such lesions, and the human respiratory tract and skin. Contact spread of infection has assumed added importance in hospitals, where a large proportion of the staff and patients carry antibiotic-resistant staphylococci in the nose or on the skin. Although cleanliness, hygiene, and aseptic management of lesions can control the spread of staphylococci from lesions, few methods are available to prevent the wide dissemination of staphylococci from carriers. Aerosols (eg, glycols) and ultraviolet irradiation of air have little effect.To diminish transmission within the hospital setting, high risk patients, such as those in intensive care units and patients transferred from chronic care facilities where prevalence is high, are frequently surveyed for anterior nares colonization. Patients who test positive by culture or PCR are placed upon contact precautions so as to minimize spread on the hands of health care workers. Health care workers should strictly adhere to infection control policies by wearing gloves and washing hands before and after patient contact.Rifampin coupled with a second oral antistaphylococcal drug sometimes provides long - term suppression and possibly cure of nasal carriage; this form of therapy is usually reserved for major problems of staphylococcal carriage, because staphylococci can rapidly develop resistance to rifampin.",

        "exp": "Ans: B (Pain is positional) Intermittent Claudication# It refers to pain or fatigue in muscles of the lower extremity caused by walking and relieved by rest# Claudication is derived from the Latin word for \"limping, lame\"; strictly speaking, the term should be used only for symptoms in the lower extremities. The pain is a deep- seated ache usually in the calf muscle, which gradually progresses until the patient is compelled to stop walking.# Patients occasionally describe \"cramping\" or \"tiredness\" in the muscle. Typically, symptoms are completely relieved after 2-5 minutes of inactivity.# Claudication is distinguished from other types of pain in the extremities in that some exertion is always required before it appears; it is reproducible; it does not occur at rest; and it is relieved by cessation of walking.# Relief of symptoms Is not dependent upon sitting or other positional change. The distance a patient can walk varies with the rate of walking, the level of incline, and the degree of arterial obstruction.# The average patient with involvement of a single arterial segment can walk 90-180 meters on a level terrain at a moderate pace before pain appears.# Regardless of which arterial segment is involved, claudication most commonly involves the calf muscles due to their high workload with normal walking.# The correct diagnosis should be easily established by determining the location of pain (calf), the quality of the pain, the length of time required for relief of symptoms, the reproducibility of symptoms, the distance walked before symptoms begin (initial claudication distance), and the type of rest or position required for symptom relief.# Although most patients with this disorder do not develop gangrene or require amputations, adverse outcomes of systemic atherosclerosis, including death, are common# There is increasing interest in the use of the ankle-brachial index (ABI). Normal is more than 1. Claudicants are in the 0.6 to 0.9 range, with rest pain and gangrene occurring at less than 0.3.# Indications for surgery include disabling claudication (severely limiting wrork or lifestyle), rest pain, limb- threatening ischemia, and microembolization of the toes in which no other source is identified.# The claudication distance will vary from day to day and will be altered by walking up hill, the speed of walking or against the wind.# Characteristically this pain is worse at nightand is worsened by elevation of the extremity, whereas it is somewhat relieved by hanging the foot out of the bed or by sleeping in a chair. This rest pain is mainly due to ischaemic changes in the somatic nerves, so it is the cry of the dying nerves.",

However, bleeding may begin earlier, and some abortions may result from such an abnormal location of the developing placenta.Digital cervical examination is never permissible unless the woman is in an operating room with all the preparations for immediate cesarean delivery--even the gentlest digital examination can cause torrential haemorrhage.The simplest, safest, and most accurate method of placental localization is provided by transabdominal sonography. Accordingly, the average accuracy is 96 percent, and rates as high as 98 percent have been obtained. False-positive results are often a result of bladder distension. Therefore, scans in apparently positive cases should be repeated after emptying the bladder.Cesarean delivery is necessary in practically all women with placenta previa. Most often, a transverse uterine incision is possible. However, because foetal bleeding may result from a transverse incision into an anterior placenta, a vertical incision is sometimes employed.

Sequencing the CFTR gene is, of course, the \u201cgold standard\u201d for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Therefore, in patients with suggestive clinical findings or family history (or both), genetic analysis may be warranted.",

        "exp": "Ans- B Fat Embolism Syndrome Fat embolism refers to the presence of fat globules in lung parenchyma and peripheral circulation after fracture of a long bone or other major trauma. And fat embolism syndrome reflects a serious systemic manifestation as a consequence to these emboli. Pathophysiology Fat embolism is a common phenomenon it is more commonly seen in patients with multiple fractures and in fractures (involving lower limbs especially femur) Fat originates from the site of trauma, particularly from the injured marrow of the fractured bones and the suggestion that the fat arises from the plasma as a result of agglutination of chylomicrons is not supported by in vivo experiments. Circulating fat globules>10 um in diameter occur in most adults after close fracture of long bones and histological traces of fat can be found in the lungs and other internal organs. Clinical Presentation The patient is usually young adult with a lower limb (esp. femur) fracture, most commonly after closed fractures of long bone (esp. shaft femur) and more so when fractures are multiple. It usually manifests itself with in 24-48 hoursQ, but occasionaly the onset may be delayed for several days. Early warning signs (with in 72 hours of injury) are a slight rise in temperature (pyrexia) and pulse rate (tachycardia)Q In more pronounced cases there is breathlessness, mild mental confusion or restlessness, pectechiae on chest, axillae, retina & conjuctival folds; progressing to marked respiratory distress & coma in severe cases. Pulmonary Manifestations Tachypnea (increased respiration rate) with cyanosis Dyspnea (breathlessness) Low oxygen content often with a normal CO2 reading indicating there is inadequate oxygenation PO2<60 mmHg Chest x-ray show snow storm appearance and mottling -a sign which rapidly disappears in a day or two. Cerebral Manifestation Headache Mild mental confusion or restlessness Irritability Delirium Stupor Convulsion Coma Cerebral signs may regress & recur, suggesting repeated flooding of the circulation with fresh emboli. Cutaneous Manifestation Diagnostic petechial rash seen on Supraclavicular Infraclavicular Shoulder Front & back of chest Axillae Retinae and Conjunctiva of lower lid Periumblical Laboratory Tests There is no characteristic laboratory test However suggestive findings are Thrombocytopenia (platelets <=1.5 lacks) P02 <60 mm Hg (8 kpa) Tachycardia Pyrexia Fall in hemoglobin value Microscopy of blood, sputum & urine for fat globules (gurd test) Fundoscopy of retina to see emboli, striate haemorrhages and fluffy exudates NCCT Head: shows characteristic focal emboli showers intracerebral region. Managment Prevention: Rough handling, inadequate immobilization and long journey to reach trauma centre are predisposing factors that must be avoided in long bone fractures. Fracture stabilization Removing fat emboli from circulation by Lipolytic agents as heparin (| serum lipase activity) Hypertonic glucose (decrease FFA production) Offset its effect by Vasodilation eg phenoxy benzamine Prompt correction of hypovolaemia Prophylactic use of O2 Dextran (expand plasma volume, reduce RBC aggregation and platelet adherence) Aprotinin (this protease inhibitor decrease platelet aggregation and serotonin release) Treatment of Established Case The aim of treatment is maintaining adequate oxygen level in the blood. If necessary by using intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Oxygen is the only therapeutic tool of proven use. It should be administered in sufficient amount to maintain arterial P02 >80 mm Hg O2 toxicity (pneumonitis) is avoided by using O2 conc. below 40% Steroids are given to avoid chemical pneumonitis resulting from break down of - pulmonary fat emboli into FFA.",
