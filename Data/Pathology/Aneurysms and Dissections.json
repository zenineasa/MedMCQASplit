Proximal lesion (Type A)o More common and more dangerous.o Involve either the ascending portion only or both ascending and the descending portion of aorta.2.

Most common cause of false aneurysm is post myocardial infarction rupture.o Aneurysm due to infection that causes weakening of vessel wall - mycotic aneurysm.o The two most important causes of aortic aneurysm (not only abdominal part but in any part of aorta) are atherosclerosis and cystic medial degeneration of arterial media.Abdominal aortic aneurvsmo The most common etiology for abdominal aortic aneurysm is atherosclerosis.o Atherosclerosis causes arterial wall thining through medial destruction secondary to plaque that originates in the intima.o Besides abdominal aorta, atherosclerotic aneurysm also occur in common iliac arteries, arch and descending part of thoracic aorta.o The usual site of abdominal aortic aneurism is below the origin of renal artery and above the bifurcation of the aorta.Remembero Most common cause of aortic aneurysm (overall) = Atherosclerosis.o Most common cause of ascending aortic aneurysm = Cystic medial necrosis.o Most common cause of descending aortic aneurysm = Atherosclerosis.o Most common cause of aneurysm of aortic arch = Atherosclerosis.o Syphilitic aneurysm affect = Ascending aorta, a Aneurysm ofTakayasu arteritis affects = Aortic arch.o Most common cause of mycotic abdominal aneurysm = salmonella gastroenteritis.",
