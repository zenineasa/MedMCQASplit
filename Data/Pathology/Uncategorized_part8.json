Takayasu's disease is a chronic inflammatory fibrosing aeritis affecting primarily the aoa and its major branches.

The inflammation and necrosis of aeries may result in thrombosis or rupture, which causes renal infarction and haemorrhage. Small vessel vasculitis predominantly affects capillaries, venules, and aerioles including the glomeruli.

The histopathological hallmark of Wegener's granulomatosis is necrotizing vasculitis of small aeries and veins together with granuloma formation which may be either intravascular or extravascular. An impoant point to note, Though it is called granulomatous vasculitis:? - Granulomas in Wegener's .granulomatosis are seen only in lungs or respiratory tract. Granulottm formation is rarely seen in other organs. Other organs, only demonstrate necrotizing vasculitis. So Wegener's granulomatosis can also be defined as Granulomatous vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tracts together with glomerulonephritis. Robbin's defines Wegener's granulomatosis as \"necrotizing vasculitis\" (not granulomatous vasculitis). According to Robbin's Wegener's granulomatosis is a necrotizing vasculitis characterized by a triad of :? - Acute necrotizing granuloma of upper respiratory tract (ear, nose, sinuses, throat) or the lower respiratory tract. - Necrotizing or granulomatous vasculitis affecting small to medium sized vessels (e.g. capillaries, venules, aeriole and aeria) most prominent in the lungs and upper airways but affecting other sites as well. - Renal disease in the form of focal necrotizing often crescenteric glomerulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis in Wegener's granulomatosis Wegener's. glomerulonephritis is characterized by \"focal and segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis\".

By about 3rd month, however, the liver and spleen are the main sites of blood cells formation and continue to do so until about 2 weeks after birth. Haematopoiesis commences in the bone marrow by 4th and 5th month and becomes fully active by 7th and 8th month, so that at birth practically all the bones contain active marrow. During normal childhood and adult life, therefore, the marrow is the only source of new blood cells. However, during childhood, there is progressive fatty replacement throughout the long bones, so that by adult life the hematopoietic marrow is confined to the central skeleton (vertebrae, sternum, ribs, skull, sacrum and pelvis) and proximal ends of femur, tibia and humerus. Even in these hematopoietic areas, about 50% of the marrow consists of fat. Non-hematopoietic marrow in the adult is, however, capable of reverting to active hematopoiesis in certain pathologic conditions. The spleen and liver can also resume their fetal hematopoietic role in certain pathologic conditions and is called extramedullary hematopoiesis.",

CD4 is a primary receptor used by HIV-1 to gain entry into host T cells. HIV-1 attaches to CD4 with a protein in its viral envelope known as gp120. The binding to CD4 creates a shift in the conformation of gp120 allowing HIV-1 to bind to two other surface receptors on the host cell, the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, depending on whether HIV is infecting a macrophage or T-helper cell. Following a structural change in another viral protein (gp41), HIV inses a fusion peptide into the host cell that allows the outer membrane of the virus to fuse with the cell membrane. HIV infection leads to a progressive reduction in the number of T cells possessing CD4 receptors. Therefore, medical professionals refer to the CD4 count to decide when to begin treatment for HIV-infected patients.",

This response may occur before any improvment in anemia is observed. The earliest hematological evidence of recovery is increase reticulocytes and their hemoglobin content. The reticulocytes attain a maximal value on the 5th to 10th day after institution of therapy and thereafter gradually return to normal. The reticulocyte response may not be detectable in mild iron deficiency anemia. The blood hemoglobin level is the most accurate measure of the degree of anemia in iron deficiency anemia. During the response to therapy, the red cell count may increase temporarily to values above normal, but the hemoglobin value lags behind. The red cell indices may remain abnormal for some time after the normal hemoglobin level is restored. As recovery occurs, a normocytic cell population gradually replaces the microcytic population; and one of the early signs of response to therapy is an increase in RBW from pretreatment level. When treatment is fully effective, hemoglobin reaches normal levels by 2 months after therapy is initiated, regardless of staing values.

It is because patient's immune system does not recognize the virus. Immunoclearance phase: Patients' immune system staed to recognize the virus and begin to kill the viruses. As Hepatitis B virus live in the liver, such killing also causes the liver cells to die. Patients often has abnormal liver panel at this stage. If this stage persists for prolonged period, patients progress to complications faster. Inactive carrier stage: At this stage, patients have low amount of Hepatitis B virus and there is little liver damage. Risk of progression decreases but may still occur. Reactivation phase: At this stage, patients' Hepatitis B virus becomes reactivated and increases in amount, with active liver damage.",

Pathogenesis of panacinar emphysema\n\nPanacinar emphysema is associated with congenital deficiency of \u03b11 -\u00a0antitrypsin.\nThis results in unchecked overactivity of neutrophil elastase that causes the destruction of alveolar wall.\nAs \u03b11\u00a0- antitrypsin is deficient throughout the acinus, the acini are uniformly involved from the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli.\nNeutrophils are the major cells in the pathogenesis of panacinar emphysema\n\nB. Pathogenesis of centriacinar emphysema\n\nCentriacinar emphysema is associated with smoking.\nNicotine acts as a direct chemoattractant for neutrophils and macrophages.\nSo, in centriacinar emphysema, both neutrophils and macrophages play a central role.\nSmoking enhances the activity of neutrophil and macrophage elastase.\nMacrophage elastase is not inhibited by a1\u00a0- antitrypsin and indeed can proteolytically digest this antiprotease.\nBeside protease - antiprotease mechanism, oxidant-antioxidant imbalance also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of smoking-related emphysema.\nNormally, the lung contains a healthy complement of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, glutathione).\nTobacco smoke contains abundant reactive oxygen species (free radicals) which deplete these antioxidant mechanisms.\nFree radicals cause tissue damage, as well as they, inactivate \u03b11\u00a0- antitrypsin, resulting in functional \u03b11\u00a0- antitrypsin deficiency even in patients without enzyme deficiency.\n\nWhy smoking-related emphysema involves centriacinar portion?\nThe impaction of smoke particles occurs predominantly at the bifurcation of respiratory bronchioles, resulting in the influx of neutrophils and macrophages, both of which secrete proteases. An increase in protease activity localized in the centriacinar region, together with the smoke-induced oxidative damage, causes the centriacinar pattern of emphysema that is seen in smokers.",

This is classifed intoi) Bilinear acute leukemia o In this, two separate blast populations are encountered. o For example blast cells of lymphoid and myeloid lineage are present simultaneously. n) Biphenotypic acute leukemia o Bipheotypic acute leukemia is also called \" hybrid acute leukemia\" or \" acute mixed lineage leukemia\" or \"simultaneous leukemia'. o In this leukemia, a single blast population demonstrates marker of more than one lineage (in contrast to bilinear leukemia where blasts of two different lineage are present). o Coexpression of myeloid with B lymphoid lineage is most common type (65%). Co-presence of myeloid with T-lymphoid lineage is second most common type. Co-expression of T and B cells phenotype or trilineage phenotype (T, B and myeloid cells) is rare. o According to the 2008 WHO classification, the requirements for lineage attribution are as follows :? a) Myeloid lineage :- Presence of myeloperoxidase or at least 2 markers of monocytic differentiation CD11c, CD 14, CD64, lysozyme, non-specific esterase b) T lineage :- Cytoplasmic or surface CD3 c) B lineage :- Strong CD19 expression with at least one of the following weakly expressed CD 10, CD 79a, cytoplasmic CD22; or weak CD 19 expression with at least 2 of the following strongly expressed CD 10, CD 79a, cytoplasmic CD22. Clinical presentation o Similar to other acute leukemias, acute leukemia with ambiguous lineage presents with symptoms related to depression of marrow function, i.e., cytopenia i.e. anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia. Coming back to question o Expression of B lineage (CD19 with CD 10) and myeloid lineage ( myeloperoxidase) confirms the diagnosis of biphenotypic leukemia.",

Recognition and attachmentPhagocytosis of microbes and dead cells is initiated by recognition of paicles by receptors expressed on leukocyte surface.These receptors are Mannose receptors and scavenger receptors.These receptors bind a variety of microbes.2. EnglulfmentBinding of a paicle to phagocytic leukocyte receptors initiates the process of active phagocytosis of the paicles.During engulment, extension of the cytoplasm, i.e., pseudopods flow around the paicle to be engulfed. Eventually, this results in complete enclosure of the paicle within a phagosome created by the plasma membrane.Membrane of this phagocytic vacuole (Phagosome) fuses with the membrane of lysosome to form phagolysosome resulting in discharge of lysosomal granule's content into phagosome.During this process neutrophils and macrophages become progressively degranulated.Phagocytosis is dependent on polymerization of actin (similar to chemotoxis that is also dependent on polymerisation of actin).3. Killing and degradationKillingMicrobial killing is accomplished largely by oxygen-depending mechanism, i.e., due to generation of reactive oxygen species.The generation of reactive oxygen species is due to rapid activation on an oxidase - NADPH oxidase. Reactive oxygen species cause membrane damage, cytoskeletal damage and DNA damage.Bacterial killing can also occur by oxygen-independent mechanisms, through action of substances in leukocyte granules -3 Bacterial permeability increasign protein (BPI), lysozyme, lactoferrin, major basic protein and defensin.DegradationAfter killing, acid hydrolases, which are normally stored in lysosomes, degrade the microbes within phagolysosome.",

Patients typically have unilateral lymph node enlargement, most often in the posterior cervical chain, which may be accompanied by fevers, chills, myalgias, malaise, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hepatosplenomegaly, or generalized lymphadenopathy. Abnormal laboratory values may include leukopenia and atypical lymphocytes. EBV has been implicated as one causative agent. Diagnosis is by biopsy of the affected lymph node, which typically shows histiocytic aggregates, atypical lymphoid cells, karyorrhectic debris, and patchy necrosis as well as absence of neutrophils or a granulomatous reaction. The disease typically resolves spontaneously after 1-6 months without treatment. Ref: Belazarian L.T., Lorenzo M.E., Pearson A.L., Sweeney S.M., Wiss K. (2012). Chapter 192.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Nitric oxideNitric oxide derived from endothelium and macrophages leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and killing of microbes Fever is caused by IL-1, TNF and prostaglandinsPyrogensA pyrogen is a substance that induces fever.These can be either internal (endogenous) or external (exogenous) to the body.The bacterial substance lipopolysaccharide (LPS), present in the cell wall of some bacteria, is an example of an exogenous pyrogen.Depyrogenation may be achieved through filtration, distillation, chromatography, or inactivation.Endogenous pyrogensIn essence, all endogenous pyrogens are cytokines, molecules that are a pa of the innate immune system.They are produced by phagocytic cells and cause the increase in the thermoregulatory set-point in the hypothalamus.Major endogenous pyrogens are interleukin 1 (alpha and beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), prostaglandins and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.Minor endogenous pyrogens include interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-beta, macrophage inflammatory protein-alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-beta as well as interferon-alpha, interferon-beta, and interferon-gamma.These cytokine factors are released into general circulation, where they migrate to the circumventricular organs of the brain due to easier absorption caused by the blood-brain barrier's reduced filtration action there.The cytokine factors then bind with endothelial receptors on vessel walls, or interact with local microglial cells.When these cytokine factors bind, the arachidonic acid pathway is then activated.Exogenous pyrogensOther mechanism of fever caused by exogenous pyrogens includes LPS, which is a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria.An immunological protein called lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) binds to LPS.The LBP-LPS complex then binds to the CD14 receptor of a nearby macrophage.This binding results in the synthesis and release of various endogenous cytokine factors, such as interleukin 1(IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha.In other words, exogenous factors cause release of endogenous factors, which, in turn, activate the arachidonic acid pathway.Pattern of fever:Continuous fever: Temperature remains above normal throughout the day and does not fluctuate more than 1 degC in 24 hours, e.g. lobar pneumonia, typhoid, urinary tract infection, brucellosis, or typhus. Typhoid fever may show a specific fever pattern, with a slow stepwise increase and a high plateau.Intermittent fever: The temperature elevation is present only for a ceain period, later cycling back to normal, e.g. malaria, kala-azar, pyaemia, or septicemia. Following are its types:- Quotidian fever, with a periodicity of 24 hours, typical of Malaria- Teian fever (48 hour periodicity), typical of Malaria- Quaan fever (72 hour periodicity), typical of Plasmodium malariae.Remittent fever: Temperature remains above normal throughout the day and fluctuates more than 1 degC in 24 hours, e.g., infective endocarditis.Pel-Ebstein fever: A specific kind of fever associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma, being high for one week and low for the next week and so on.A neutropenic fever, also called febrile neutropenia, is a fever in the absence of normal immune system function. Because of the lack of infection-fighting neutrophils, a bacterial infection can spread rapidly; this fever is, therefore, usually considered to require urgent medical attention. This kind of fever is more commonly seen in people receiving immune-suppressing chemotherapy than in apparently healthy people.Febricula is an old term for a low-grade fever, especially if the cause is unknown, no other symptoms are present, and the patient recovers fully in less than a weekNitric oxideIt is also known as the 'endothelium-derived relaxing factor', or 'EDRF'It is biosynthesized endogenously from L-arginine, oxygen and NADPH by various nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes.The endothelium (inner lining) of blood vessels uses nitric oxide to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, thus resulting in vasodilation and increasing blood flow.Nitric oxide is highly reactive (having a lifetime of a few seconds), yet diffuses freely across membranes.These attributes make nitric oxide ideal for a transient paracrine (between adjacent cells) and autocrine (within a single cell) signaling molecule.The production of nitric oxide is elevated in populations living at high altitudes, which helps these people avoid hypoxia by aiding in pulmonary vasculature vasodilation.Effects include vasodilatation, neurotransmission, modulation of the hair cycle, production of reactive nitrogen intermediates and penile erections (through its ability to vasodilate).Nitroglycerin and amyl nitrite serve as vasodilators because they are conveed to nitric oxide in the body.The vasodialating antihypeensive drug minoxidil contains an NO moity and may act as an NO agonist.Similarly, Sildenafil citrate, popularly known by the trade name Viagra, stimulates erections primarily by enhancing signaling through the nitric oxide pathway in the penis.Nitric oxide is also generated by phagocytes (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) as pa of the human immune response.Nitric oxide can contribute to reperfusion injury when an excessive amount produced during reperfusion (following a period of ischemia) reacts with superoxide to produce the damaging oxidant peroxynitrite.",

Gene mutations\n\nThe vast majority of mutations associated with the hereditary disease are gene mutations.\nThese may of different types depending on whether it involves complete gene or single base -\n\n(a) Point mutation\n\nA single nucleotide base is substituted by a different base.\nWhen a pyrimidine base is substituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is\u00a0substituted by other purine \u2192 Transition.\nWhen a purine is substituted by a pyrimidine or vice-versa \u2192 Transversion.\nThis may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i.e. in codon and leads to the replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product.\nBecause these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation.\nAn example is a sickle mutation in which CTC codon in beta-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid are changed to CAC codon that codes for valine.\nAnother type of point mutation is a nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon.\nExample is beta-thalassemia in which CAG codon in p-chain of hemoglobin that code for Glutamine is changed to stop codon UAG Acer point mutation.\n\nb. Deletion and insertions\n\nDeletion or insertion of one or two bases lead to alteracations in the reading frame of the DNA\n\nStrand \u2192 frameshift mutation.\n\nIf the number of base pairs involved is three or a multiple of three frameshift does not occur\u00a0(Because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized.\n\nc. Trinucleotide repeat mutation\n\nNormally a codon is triplet i.e., trinucleotide.\nIn this type of mutation a codon, i.e., trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the Same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain,\nFor example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. There are 250- 4000 tandem repeats of CGG\n\n2. Chromosome mutation\nThe result from the rearrangement of genetic material that gives rise to visible structural changes in the Chromosome.\n3.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Antibodies of IgM class I dopathic thrombocytopenic purpura :? There are two clinical subtypes of primary I.T.P, acute and chronic both are autoimmune disorders in which platelet destruction results from formation of antiplatelet antibodies. Pathogenesis Chronic ITP is caused by the formation of autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoproteins most often Hb-lIla or Ib-IX. In overwhelming majority of cases the antiplatelet antibodies are of the .IgL, class. The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar to that seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Opsonized platelets are rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. The spleen is the major site of the destruction of platelets. Pathology The principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic. The point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in spleen, the spleen size remains normal. On histological examination there is congestion of the sinusoids and hyperactivity and enlargement of the splenic follicles manifested by the formation of prominent germinal centres. Sometimes scattered megakaryocytes are found within the sinuses and sinusoidal walls. This represents a very mild form of extramedullary hematopoiesis. These splenic findings are not sufficiently distinctive to be considered diagnostic. Bone Marrow Bone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes. These findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction. The impoance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure. A decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I.T.P.",

Having scant cytoplasm and nuclei somewhat larger than those of small lymphocytes. The nuclear chromatin is delicate and finely stippled and nucleoli are either absent or inconspicuous. Contain cytoplasmic aggregates of Periodic acid schiff (PAS)positive material. Clinical manifestations o Symptoms related to depression of normal marrow function. An accumulation of neoplastic blast cells in the bone marrow suppresses normal hematopoiesis by physical crowding and competition for growth factors. This results in : ? Anemia --> Fatigue, pallor Neutropenia --> Infection, fever Thrombocytopenia ---> Bleeding, petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis. These are the most common sign & symptoms. o Bone pain tenderness Resulting from marrow expansion and infiltration of the subperiosteum. o Generalized lymphodenopathy, Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Caused by neoplastic infiltration of these tissues. More common in ALL than AML. o Symptoms related to compression of large mediastinal vessels or airway. In Pre-T ALL of thymus. o CNS manifestation Due to meningeal involvement Headache, vomiting, nerve palsies. More common in ALL than in AML. o Testicular involvement is also more common inALL than in AML.

B: Red hepatizationAll 4 phases may be seen in different pas of the same lung.Congestion (1-2 days)Red hepatization (2nd-4th day)Gray hepatization (4th-6th day)Resolution ( 8th-9th day)In the earliest stage of pneumococcal pneumonia, protein-rich edema fluid containing numerous organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae) fills the alveoli. Marked congestion of the capillaries is typical.Sholy after this congestion occurs there is a massive outpouring of polymorphonuclear leukocytes accompanied by intra-alveolar hemorrhage. Many of the red blood cells undergo lysis. These cells, together with polymprphonuclearleukocytes, produce the rusty sputum.Because the firm consistency of the affected lung is reminiscent of the liver, this stage has been named \"red hepatization\". The next phase, occurring after 2 or more days, depending on the success of treatment, involves the lysis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the appearance of macrophages, which phagocytose the fragmented polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other inflammatory debris.The lung is now no longer congested but still remains firm in this stage of \"gray hepatization\".The alveolar exudates is then removed and the lung gradually returns to normal.",

It is the measure of size of RBC. Reduced MCV means microcytic and increased MCV means macrocytic RBCs. Normal TLC is 4000-11000, normal platelet count is\u00a01,50,000 to 4,50,000 and normal Hb is above 12 g/dL.\nNow, considering the options one by one:\n\nAplastic anemia has reduced RBC, WBC as well as platelet counts. Anemia is normocytic normochromic, thus it can be easily ruled out.\nParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) typically presents with anemia which is usually normocytic normochromic.\n\nIf MCV is high, it is due to reticulocytosis. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may or may not be present.\nTherefore, this option also cannot be the answer.\n\nMegaloblastic anemia presents with raised MCV. There may be leukopenia as well as thrombocytopenia. Severity of these changes parallels the degree of anemia.\nMyelo\ufb01brosis usually presents with anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Mostly anemia is normocytic but in 30% cases, microcytic anemia can be present.\n\nBased on the above discussion, the most probable answer is \u2018Myelo\ufb01brosis\u2019.\nHowever, the value of MCV given is 12 fL which is practically not possible. Normal value of MCV is 80-\u00a0100 fL. MCV < 50 fL is considered to be extremely low.

Silver stains for fungi are negative. Which of the following is the MOST likely condition that predisposed the patient to this pulmonary disease?",
        "exp": "The lesion shown is a necrotizing granuloma developing as a result of infection by acid-fast bacilli (most likely mycobacteria). Granulomatous inflammation is a specialized form of chronic inflammation, which begins with the uptake of foreign antigens by macrophages. These cells process and present the antigen to helper T lymphocytes, which in turn activate macrophages by interferon-g secretion. Granulomas may be due to infectious and noninfectious causes. Usually, infectious granulomas are necrotizing and non-infectious granulomas are non-necrotizing, but there are many exceptions to this rule. Among the infectious causes, mycobacterial infections are of the utmost impoance, especially in patients with AIDS. Fungi may also cause granulomas, which may be of the necrotizing or non-necrotizing type. By definition, however, caseating necrosis is pathognomonic of mycobacterial infection.Also know:Common variable immunodeficiency is one of the most common forms of congenital immune deficiency syndrome. It is due to inability of lymphocytes to mature into plasma cells. Consequently, levels of immunoglobulins are depressed, and patients suffer from depressed humoral immunity. Cell-mediated immunity (on which granuloma formation is largely dependent) is intact. Cystic fibrosis predisposes to recurrent bronchopneumonia and development of bronchiectasis. Depressed level of consciousness predisposes to aspiration of gastric contents and development of aspiration pneumonia. Sheets of macrophages are often observed, but not necrotizing granulomas (unless there are additional predisposing conditions, such as AIDS). Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C.R. (1998). Chapter 7.

        "exp": "Antifibrinolytic Drugs:\nBleeding in the gum, gastrointestinal tract, and during oral surgery requires the use of oral antifibrinolytic drugs such as \u03b5-aminocaproic acid (EACA) or tranexamic acid to control local hemostasis. The duration of the treatment depending on the clinical indication is 1 week or longer. Tranexamic acid is given at doses of 25 mg/kg three to four times a day. EACA treatment requires a loading dose of 200 mg/kg (maximum of 10 g) followed by 100 mg/Kg per dose (maximum 30 g/d) every 6h.\nGeneral considerations regarding the treatment of bleeds in hemophilia include the following: (1) Treatment should begin as soon as possible because symptoms often precede objective evidence of bleeding; because of the superior efficacy of early therapeutic intervention, classic symptoms of bleeding into the joint in a\u00a0reliable patient, headaches, or automobile or other accidents require prompt replacement and further laboratory\u00a0investigation, (2) Drugs that hamper platelet function, such as aspirin or aspirin containing drugs, should be avoided; to control pain, drugs such as ibuprofen or propoxyphene are preferred. FVIII and FIX are dosed in units. One unit is defined as the amount of FVIII (100 ng/mL) or FIX (5 \u03bcg/mL) in 1 mL of normal plasma. One unit of FVIII per kilogram of body weight increases the plasma level by 2%. One can calculate the dose needed to increase FVIII levels to 100%\u00a0in a 70-kg severe hemophilia patient (<1%) using the simple formula below.\u00a0Thus, 3500 units of FVIII will raise the circulating level to 100%.\nFVIII dose (IU) = Target FVIII levels \u2013 FVIII baseline levels x Body weight (kg) x 0.5 unit/kg.\nThe doses for FIX replacement are different from those for FVIII, because FIX recover after infusion is usually only 50% of the predicted value. Therefore, the formula for FIX replacement is as follows:\nFIX dose (IU) = Target FIX levels \u2013 FIX baseline levels x Body weight (Kg) x 1 unit/Kg.\nThe FVIII half-life of 8-12 h requires injections twice a day to maintain therapeutic levels, whereas the FIX half-life is longer, 24 h, so that once-a-day injection is sufficient. In specific situations such as after surgery, continuous infusion of factor may be desirable because of its safety in achieving sustained factor levels at a lower total cost.\u00a0Cryoprecipitate is enriched with FVIII protein (each bag contains 80 IU of FVIII) and was commonly used for the treatment of hemophilia A decades ago; it is still in use in some developing countries, but because of the risk of bloodborne diseases, this product should be avoided in hemophilia patients when factor concentrates are available.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nReference:\u00a0 Harrison\u2019s Principles of Internal Medicine 20th ed page no 832",

The gel is applied for at least 5 minutes by means of custom fabricated flexible plastic carriers.\nTo be maximally effective, the programme must be instituted at the beginning of radiotherapy and continued every day.\u00a0Such a regimen can also arrest caries caused by xerostomia in previously unprotected patients.\u00a0Because of the ever present risk of caries in xerostomic patients, only diligent, lifelong cooperation will assure prevention.\nReference: Shafer\u2019s Textbook of ORAL PATHOLOGY Eighth Edition page no 686",

        "exp": "The characteristic finding on histologic examination of a biopsy from a patient with Paget disease of bone is a mosaic pattern of lamellar bone. This pattern, which resembles a jigsaw puzzle in appearance, reflects the tight apposition of irregular units of bone that adhere to one another with prominent cement lines. These findings are characteristic of fully developed Paget disease, and are the ones most likely to be illustrated on an examination. However, you should be aware that early Paget disease typically shows lytic rather than proliferative bone lesions, and it is thought that the primary defect involves the osteoclasts, which are typically abnormally large with more than the usual number of nuclei. This is followed by overly vigorous osteoblastic activity, which eventually produces the characteristic mosaic bone. Benign spindle cells growing in a storiform pattern are characteristic of fibrous coical defect and nonossifying fibroma. A cailage nodule within a bony medullary cavity is characteristic of enchondroma. Spirochetes visible with silver stain are a feature of skeletal syphilis. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C.R. (1998).

        "exp": "Ans. C: Thrombocytosis According to its original description, TTP was defined as the pentad of fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, transient neurological deficits, and renal failure. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/TTP/Moschcowitz syndrome It is a rare disorder cauing extensive microscopic thromboses to form in small blood vessels throughout the body (thrombotic microangiopathy). Most cases of TTP arise from inhibition of the enzyme ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease responsible for cleaving large multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) into smaller units. A rarer form of TTP, called Upshaw-Schulman syndrome, is genetically inherited as a dysfunction of ADAMTS13. If large vWF multimers persist there is tendency for increased coagulation. Red blood cells passing the microscopic clots are subjected to shear stress which damages their membranes, leading to intravascular hemolysis and schistocyte formation. Reduced blood flow due to thrombosis and cellular injury results in end organ damage. Current therapy is based on suppo and plasmapheresis to reduce circulating antibodies against ADAMTS13 and replenish blood levels of the enzyme Classically, the following five features (\"pentad\") are indicative of TTP: - Neurologic symptoms (fluctuating), such as hallucinations, bizarre behavior, altered mental status, stroke or headaches - Kidney failure - Fever - Thrombocytopenia, leading to bruising or purpura - Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (anemia, jaundice and a blood film featuring evidence of mechanical fragmentation of red blood cells)",

The cholinergic innervation of the LES is intact or affected only in the advanced stage.\nThere is neurogenic degeneration either idiopathic or due to infection. The degenerative changes are either intrinsic (degeneration of ganglion cells of Aurebach's myentric plexus) or extrinsic (extra esophageal vagus nerve or the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus).\nAs a result of the abnormality, LES fails to relax and there is progressive dilatation of esophagus above the level of\u00a0\u200bLES.\n\nClinical findings\n\nBoth sexes are equally affected (Ref : Maingot's 10th/e p. 846)\nMay develop at any age but peak years are from 30 to 60.\nClassical clinical symptom is progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Dysphagia is worsened by emotional stress and hurried eating.\nRegurgitation and pulmonary aspiration occur because of retention of large volumes of saliva and ingested food in the esophagus.\nEsophagitis with ulceration may occur with chronic retention of food.\nPain is infrequent in classical achlasia but a variant called vigrous achlasia is characterized by chest pain and esophageal spasms that generate non-propulsive high-pressure waves in the body of the esophagus.\n\nSecondry achalasia may arise in chagas disease, in which trypanosoma cruzi causes destruction of myentric plexus of the esophagus, duodenum, colon, and ureter, with resultant dilatation of these viscera.",

        "exp": "This appeared to be a tough question but let us analyze all the options step wise.\n\nBoth B cells and T cells have antigen specific receptors. T cells have an antigen specific T cell receptor (TCR) composed of a and b polypeptide chains in 95% cases to bind with the antigen. B cells have a B cell receptor (BCR) having unique antigen specificity composed of IgM and IgD on their surface to bind with the antigen.\nSince MHC I is expressed on all the nucleated cells, so, it is likely to be present on both \u2018B\u2019 as well as \u2018T\u2019 cells. As discussed in our accompanying DVD on Immunology, the T cells undergo both negative and positive selection. Both these are described below:\nPositive selection: T cells in the thymic cortex are allowed to survive only if their T cell receptor has affinity for the MHC molecule. If the T cells do not have any affinity for the MHC molecule, they are programmed to die. This is important because only if this affinity is present, the T cells can interact with the antigen presenting cells. So, positive selection is required for self MHC restriction.\nNegative selection: T cells come in the thymic medulla after being already positively selected in the thymic cortex. In the medulla, if a T cell has affinity for \u2018self antigens\u2019, they are eliminated. This is called as negative selection. It is therefore required for the self tolerance.\nSimilar to the negative selection of the T cells, the B cells may also recognize \u2018self antigens\u2019 in the bone marrow. In this situation, the B cell undergoes antigen receptor gene rearrangement so as to express new antigen receptors. These new receptors are designed as to not recognize \u2018self antigens\u2019. This process is described as \u2018receptor editing\u2019. If because of any reason receptor editing does not take place, the B cells undergo apoptosis. This is the negative selection of B cells in the bone marrow.",

For this reason, it is also sometimes referred to as macrophage activation syndrome. Pathogenesis The common feature of all forms of HLH is systemic activation of macrophages and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. The activated macrophages phagocytose blood cell progenitors in the marrow and formed elements in the peripheral tissues, while the \"stew\"of mediators released from macrophages and lymphocytes suppress hematopoiesis and produce symptoms of systemic inflammation. These effects lead to cytopenias and a shock-like picture, sometimes referred to as \"cytokine storm\" or the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Familial forms of HLH are associated with several different mutations, all of which impact the ability of cytotoxic T cells and NK to properly form or deploy cytotoxic granules. The most common trigger for HLH is infection, paicularly with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Clinical Features Most patients present with an acute febrile illness associated with splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Hemophagocytosis is usually seen on bone marrow examination, but is neither sufficient nor required to make the diagnosis. Laboratory studies typically reveal anemia, thrombocytopenia, and very high levels of plasma ferritin and soluble IL-2 receptor, both indicative of severe inflammation, as well as elevated liver function tests and triglyceride levels, both related to hepatitis. Coagulation studies may show evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. If untreated, this picture can progress rapidly to multiorgan failure, shock, and death. Treatment Involves the use of immunosuppressive drugs and \"mild\" chemotherapy. Patients with germline mutations that cause HLH or who have persistent/resistant disease are candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Without treatment, the prognosis is grim, paicularly in those with familial forms of the disease, who typically survive for less than 2 months.",

PCD is a genetically heterogenous disorder affecting motile cilia.

Vasoconstriction\no After initial injury, there is a brief period arteriolar vasoconstriction, minimizing vessel\u00a0diameter and stowing bleeding.\no This is due to reflex neurogenic mechanism and augmented by a potent endothelium derived\u00a0vasoconstrictor endothelin.\no However this effect is transient, bleeding would resume if there will no activation of platelet and\u00a0coagulation system.\nB. Primary hemostasis\no Endothelial injury exposes highly thrombogenic subendothelial extracellular matrix which allows\u00a0the platelets to bind (adhere) with collagen of ECM.\no Binding of platelets activates these cells and platelets release secretory' granules.\no These secretory' products (from secretory granules) recruit additional platelets to form primary\u00a0hemostatic (platelet plug).\nC. Secondary hemostasis\no Coagulation\u00a0system is activated\u00a0and thrombin is generated,\no Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin.\no Ultimately these events form an irreversibly fused mass of platelets, thrombin RBCs and\u00a0fibrinogen \u2192 Definitive secondary hemostatic plug.\nD. Repair of vessels and dissolution of the clot\no The clot attracts and stimulates the growth of fibroblast and smooth muscle cells within the\u00a0vessel wall, and begins the repair process.\no At this stage the fibrinolytic system is also activated, resulting in the dissolution of the clot.",

The different types all have defects in the synthesis of type I collagen, often with insufficient or abnormal pro-a1(1) or pro-a2(1) chains. These deficits produce an unstable collagen triple helix that is not as strong as normal collagen.Defective glycogen metabolism is associated with the various glycogen storage diseases, such as von Gierke disease and Pompe disease. These diseases tend to present with profound hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, or muscle weakness.Defective mucopolysaccharide metabolism is associated with the mucopolysaccharidoses, such as Hurler and Hunter syndromes.

Endothelial injuryo Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade.o Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornestone in the development of atherosclerosis.o After injury, endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 andthere is increased permeability to endothelium.o TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression.2. Migration of leukocyteso When VCAM- 1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium.o Leukocytes than cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space.o Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells --> formation of earliest lesion, i.e. fatty streak.o Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modifiedLDL).Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferationo Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-a and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation.4. Maturation of plagueo Smooth muscle cells synthesize extracellular matrix (especially collegen) and conve a fatty streak into a mature fibrofatty atheroma, and contribute to the progressive growth of atherosclerotic lesions.",
