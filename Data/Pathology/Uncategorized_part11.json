Brain metastases are three times more common than all primary brain tumors combined. Must know: Brain metastases arise from hematogenous spread and frequently arise from either a lung primary or are associated with pulmonary metastases. Most metastases develop at the gray matter-white matter junction in the watershed distribution of the brain where intravascular tumor cells lodge in terminal aerioles. The distribution of metastases in the brain approximates the propoion of blood flow such that about 85% of all metastases are supratentorial and 15% occur in the posterior fossa. The most common sources of brain metastases are lung and breast carcinomas; melanoma has the greatest propensity to metastasize to the brain, being found in 80% of patients at autopsy. Ovarian and esophageal carcinoma rarely metastasize to the brain. Prostate and breast cancer also have a propensity to metastasize to the dura and can mimic meningioma. Leptomeningeal metastases are common from hematologic malignancies and also breast and lung cancers. Spinal cord compression primarily arises in patients with prostate and breast cancer, tumors with a strong propensity to metastasize to the axial skeleton. Ref: DeAngelis L.M., Wen P.Y. (2012).

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e. germline mosaicism Inheritance of Tuberous sclerosis o Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic condition which is transmitted either through inheritance or as a spontaneous genetic mutation. o Mutation in one of the two genes TSC1 and TSC2 have been identified as a cause for tuberous sclerosis. o Approximately 33% or one third of people with Tuberous sclerosis inherit it from a parent who also has tuberous sclerosis. This occurs dominance inheritance. o Thus there is 50 per cent chance with each pregnancy for a parent with Tuberous sclerosis to have a child with Tuberous sclerosis. o In the remaining 66 % or two thirds of the people with Tuberous sclerosis, neither parent has tuberous sclerosis. o It appears that one of the normal genes from either parent changes to the abnormal form, leading to a new (or sporadic), occurrence of tuberous sclerosis in the child. Normally these parents do not have another child with tuberous sclerosis because the mutation was sporadic not inherited. However, some families have more than one child with Tuberous sclerosis even though neither parent showed symptoms or findings of Tuberous sclerosis. How does this occur? o Scientists have determined that small number of physically unaffected parents of a child with TSC have mutations in some of their cells. o Because the mutation is limited to a small poion of all of the body's cells, these individuals show no signs of Tuberous sclerosis. o But if a poion of the egg or sperm cells of a parent carries the tuberous sclerosis mutation, that parent can have more than one affected child, possibly at the same 50/50 chance that people with Tuberous sclerosis have. o A person who carries cells with Tuberous sclerosis mutation in her egg or his sperm supply has germline mosaicism. o \"Mosaicism\" means that the person's body is made up of a combination of cells with and cells without a Tuberous sclerosis mutation. o 'Germline mosaicism' refers to the presence of cells with Tuberous sclerosis mutations in the egg or the sperm cell supply. o Germline mosaicism is relatively rare and this explanation does not apply to most families with a sporadically affected child. However, the occurrence of germline mosaicism has geneticists to estimate a recurrence risk (or chance that a family with a sporadically affected child will have anohter child with TSC) ranging from 1 to 3%.

Early-stage tumors of the parotid often can be treated by subtotal parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Advanced tumors may necessitate total removal\u00a0of the parotid gland,\u00a0with sacrifice of the facial nerve. Submandibular gland\u00a0tumors are\u00a0treated by\u00a0assured surgical excision. For low-grade neoplasms, only a modest margin of surrounding normal tissue may need to be removed, but high-grade or tumors warrant wider resection, similar to that required for squamous cell carcinomas. If\u00a0there is underlying bone destruction, then the involved bone\u00a0must be excised.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma is a relentless tumor that is prone to local recurrence and eventual distant metastasis.

The woman is referred to an endocrinologist for evaluation of her thyroid. The endocrinologist suspects Riedel thyroiditis. Which of the following findings on physical examination would best help confirm the diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Riedel thyroiditis, also called ligneous (rocklike) stroma, is a rare form of chronic thyroiditis characterized microscopically by a marked fibrous reaction that destroys most or all of the thyroid gland and may involve adjacent structures. The etiology is unknown. Clinically, this disease tends to affect middle-aged and older, mostly female patients and causes the thyroid to have a firm \"woody\" texture. It may be clinically mistaken for a neck malignancy and can cause symptoms of stridor, dyspnea, dysphasia, laryngeal nerve paralysis, or hypothyroidism. Eyeball protrusion suggests the hypehyroidism of Graves disease. A massive, soft thyroid gland suggests multinodular goiter. A painful and tender thyroid suggests subacute granulomatous (de Quervain) thyroiditis. Ref: Lal G., Clark O.H. (2010). Chapter 38. Thyroid, Parathyroid, and Adrenal. In F.C. Brunicardi, D.K.

Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry is a method of analyzing and identifying cell types based on binding of antibodies to specific components of the cell. Antibody, which is specific for an antigen of a paicular tissue, is labled with a probe (coloured marker) and is run on the tissue specimen obtained from a biopsy. If the tissue has that paicular antigen, then antibody will get attached to the tissue and the labled antibody can be seen under a microscope. Intermediate filaments of cytoskeleton are the major antigens used in immunohistochemistry. There are five major types of intermediate filaments - Cytokeratin Carcinoma, mesothelioma, Non-seminoma GCT Vimentin Sarcoma (Tumor of mesenchymal), melanoma, seminomas, lymphoma Neurofilament Neural tumors Glial fibrillary acid Non-neural brain tissue (astroglial origin-3 Astrocytoma, ependymomas, proteins (GFAP) medulloblastoma, oligodendroglioma) Desmin Leiomyoma (smooth muscle) & Rhabdomyoma (skeletal ms).",

Delayed type hypersensitivity In delayed hypersensitivity reactions, CD-4 T cells and macrophages are primarily involved. o The term delayed is used to differentiate it from a secondary cellular response, which appears at 48-72 hours after antigen exposure and from an immediate hypersensitivity response, which generally appears within minutes. Delayed hypersinsitivity is a major mechanism of defence against various intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria, fungi and ceain parasites. Pathophysiology Delayed hypersensitivity is characterized by formation of granuloma - a localized mass that contains activated macrophages (epitheloid) cells surrounded by collor of lymphocytes and giant cells. o It is also called granulomatous inflammation. o The cellular events stas when antigen (eg tuberculin antigen) on antigen presenting cell comes in contact with naive CD-4 T cells ---> naive CD-4 T cells recognize these peptide antigen in association with MHC - II and differentiate in to T4-1 cells. o Induction of T4-I cells is of central impoance because the expression of delayed hypersensitivity largely depends on the cytokines secreted by T4-1 cells. 2.

The subsequent differentiation of antigen-stimulated T cells to TH1 or TH17 cells is driven by the cytokines produced by APCs at the time of T-cell acti- vation. In some situations the APCs (dendritic cells and macrophages) produce IL-12, which induces differentiation of CD4+ T cells to the TH1 subset. IFN-y produced by these effector cells promotes fuher TH1 development, thus amplifying the reaction. If the APCs produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and a close relative of IL-12 called IL-23, these stimulate differentiation of T cells to the TH17 subset.",

Type Ilfamilial lipoprein lipase deficiency) o Lipoprotein lipase is required for the hydrolysis of chylomicrons and VLDL tri glycerides. o Deficiency of LPL results in decrease hydrolysis and elevated levels of plasma chylomicrons. o VLDL may also be increased but chylomicrons predominate. o Clinical manifestations Severe abdominal pain due to acute pancreatitis. Lipemia retinalis --> opalescent retinal vessels. Eruptive xanthomas ---> on back, buttocks and extensor surface of legs and arms. Hepatosplenomegaly --> due to uptake of chylomicron by RE cells of liver & spleen. Note - Similar disorder may occur with Apo-C II deficiency, because apo C-II acts as a cofacter for LPL (see previous explanations on lipid transpo). In Apo II deficiency, LPL becomes inactive. 2. Type II A.Tvpe Ha (familial hvpercholesterolemia) o It is due to deficiency of LDL receptors. o There are two sources of increased LDL Decreased clearance of LDL LDL receptors. Increased production LDL from IDL normally 40-60% of IDL is taken up by liver LDL receptors, but in LDL receptor deficiency, clearance of IDL is decreased. So, more IDL is conveed to LDL. o Clinical manifestations Tuberous and tendon xanthoma on hands, wrist, elbows, knees, heels (especially the achilles tendon) or buttocks. Xanthelesma --> Barely elevated deposits of cholesterol over eyelids. Premature atherosclerosis coronary hea diseases. Peripheral vascular disease Corneal arcus B.TypeIlb (familial combined hvperlipidemia) o It is a disorder genetically distinct from the other inherited hyperlipidemias and characterized by the type II or type IV lipoprotein pattern that may change from time to time. o It is due to L LDL receptors and increased secretion of Apo B-100 (major apoprotein of VLDL) -9 So, both LDL and VLDL are increased. o Clinical manifestations There are no xanthomas (as seen with type 11a). Increased risk of CHD. Peripheral vascular disease. 3. Type DI (Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia) o Also known as familial broad - $ disease. o This is due do abnormality in Apo - E. o Apo - E acts as a ligand for LDL receptors and helps in hepatic uptake of chylomiron remnants and VLDL remnants, i.e. IDL (see previous explanations of lipid transpo). o Due to defective uptake, Chylomicron remnants and VLDL remnants (IDL) are increased. o Clinical manifestations Tubero-eruptive xanthomas. Palmar xanthomas (xanthomata striata palmas). Premature atherosclerosis --* CHD Peripheral vascular disease Type IV (familial hyperiglyceridemia) o There is elevated levels of VLDL due to increased hepatic production of VLDL and impaired catabolism of VLDL. o It may be due to Apo - V deficiency (Apo - V promotes LPL mediated triglyceride lipolysis). o Premature coronary aery disease may occur but the chances are very-very less than in type II & Type III hyperlipidemias. Type V (Endogenous hvperiglyceridemia) o Pathogenesis may be similar to type IV, but it is more severe and both VLDL and chylomicrons are raised because both these are metabolized by same LPL and competes with each other for metabolism. o Clinical manifestations These are same as in type I familial LPL deficiency, i.e. o Pancreatitis o Lipemia retinalis o Eruptive xanthomas o Hepatosplenomegaly",

Neurofibromatosis - Neurofibromatois II Genetics of Neurofibromatosis Both the neurofibromas are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The genes for them are located on different chromosome - NF-1--) Neurofibrin gene on chromosome 17 - NF-2 --) Merlin gene on chromosome 22 NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE I ? Neurofibromatosis is a comparatively common hereditary disorder in which the skin, nevous system, bone, endocrine glands and sometimes other organs are at the sites of a variety of congenital abnormalities often taking the fonn of benign tumours. . The main feature of neurofibromatosis I is - (i) Spots of hyperpigmentation and (ii) Cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromatous tumours'. Hyperpigmentation in Neurofibromatosis I takes two forms :? a) Cafe - au - lait spots' . These are patches of pigmentation and they appear sholy after bih' and occur anywhere on the body. . They are light brown in colour (cafe - au - lait) and do not change in number as the patient ages but they increase in size during pubey. . Presence of more than six cafe - au - lait spots > 1.5 cm in size is considered diagnostic of Neurofibromatosis. b) Freckles' . Neurofibromatosis I is also characterized by the presence of Freckles like or diffuse pigmentation of the axillae and other interiginous areas (groin, under breast) and small round whitish spots. When coupled with cafe au lait patches they are viually pathogtzomonice of the disease. ii) Neurofibromas a) Cutaneous tumours . They are situated in the dermis and form discrete soft or, firm papules. . They are ,flesh coloured or violaceous and often topped with comedo. When pressed, the soft tumours tend to invaginate through a small opening in the skin giving the feeling of a seedless raisin or a scrotum without a testicle. This phenomenon is spoken of as \"button holding\". b) Subcutaneous tumours . They take two forms ? a) Firm discrete nodules attached to a nerve. b) Plexiform neuromase (overgrowth of subcutaneous tissue sometimes reaching enormous size and occur most often in the face, scalp, neck and chest and may cause hideous disfigurement). Lisch Nodule'? This is another unique .finding of neurofibromatosiso. . It is a small whitish spote present in the iris. Tumours associated with Neurofibromatosis I are 1) Tumours of the CNS a) Optic Nerve Gliomao b) Non-optic Gliomas (usually low grade astrocytomas) c) Nonneoplastic ' hamaomatous\" lesion Osborn writes - \"The common CNS tumor in NF-1 is optic nerve glioma occuring in 5 to 15% of casese\" 2) Other tumours associated with NF-1 a) Pheochromocytoma b) Rhabdomyosarcoma c) leukemia (myeloid leukemia) d) Wilms tumour e) Juvenile Xanthogranuloma",

Increased NADPH oxidase activity leads to increased oxidative proesses and there by increased production of superoxide anion (02-) Superoxide is then conveed to hydrogen peroxide (1-1,02) free radical. The 11,0, generated by NADPH oxidase system is not able to kill the bacteria itself However, the azurophilic , granules of the neutrophils contain the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) which in presence of halide such as Cl? conves H202 to hypochlorite (HOCI). Hypochloth'e (HOCI) is a potent antimicrobicidal agent that destroys microbes by halogenation. The H20,- MPO - halide system is the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils. Chediak higashi syndrome It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Chediak higashi syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transpo of materials into lysosomes. Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins. During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterial. Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome. Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation. As a result, most people with chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, staing in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening. Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected. The other cells involved are ? - Melanosotnes of melanocytes - Dense bodies of platelets - Granules of schwann cells In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism i.e the colour (-)f skin, hair and eye is reduced. Abnormality in platelets produce bleeding disorders. Defective granules in schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e.g. peripheral neuropathy. More on chediak higashi syndrome Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase (lymphoma like stage). This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E.B.virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelarated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life threatening and lead to death. Bruton's agammaglobulinemia Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is an X-linked disease that occurs mainly in males. It is caused due to defect in the gene Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Bruton's tyrosine kinase plays a crucial role in B cell maturation as well as mast cell activation. Defect in Bruton's tyrosine kinase leads to failure of maturation of B cells. B cells cannot mature beyond pro B cell stage. In the absence of mature B cell, patient lacks lymphoid tissue and fails to develop plasma cells, (the cells that produce antibodies). Thus there is absence of immunoglobulins of all classes in Bruton's agammaglobulinemia. Germinal centres, where B cells proliferate and differentiate are poorly developed, in all lymphoid tissues including the .spleen, tonsils, adenoids, peripheral lymph nodes. Peyer patches in the intestine are small or absent. Clinical features Patients with Bruton's agammaglobulinemia do not manifest any symptoms till 6 months of life (due to the presence-of maternal antibodies). These patients are susceptible to infections with capsulated bacterias because antibody response is vital to kill encapsulated bacterias. Antibodies help in opsonization of encapsulated bacterias such as staphylococcus aureus, 11 ifluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae. The polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the encapsulated bacteria is a potent virulent agent. It protects the bacteria from phagocytosis. These bacterias can only be phagocytosed when they are opsonised (coated) with specific proteins (opsoni us). Opsonized (coated) bacterias become attractive targets for phagocytes because phagocytes express high affinity receptors for opsonins. The major opsonins present in the body are IgG antibody and C3b complement. In Bruton's agammaglobulinemia antibodies are absent therefore opsonisation is defective.",

B: HypeensionFindings of atrial myxoma?Jugular venous pressure may be elevated, and a prominent a wave may be present.A loud S1 is caused by a delay in mitral valve closure due to the prolapse of the tumor into the mitral valve orifice (mimicking mitral stenosis).P2 may be delayed. Its intensity may be normal or increased, depending on the presence of pulmonary hypeension.In many cases, an early diastolic sound, called a tumor plop, is heard. This sound is produced by the impact of the tumor against the endocardial wall or when its excursion is halted.An S3 or S4 may be audible.A diastolic atrial rumble may be heard if the tumor is obstructing the mitral valve.If there is valve damage from the tumor, mitral regurgitation may cause a systolic murmur at the apex.A right atrial tumor may cause a diastolic rumble or holosystolic murmur due to tricuspid regurgitation.The major clinical manifestation are due to valvular \"ball-valve\" obstruction. Embolization, or a syndrome of constitutional symptoms such as fever, cyanosis, digital clubbing, rash, or petechiae. Sometimes fragmentation and systemic embolization calls attention to these lesion.Patients with familial myxoma may have a variety of features called syndrome myxoma or Carney syndrome, as follows:- Myxomas in breast, skin, thyroid gland, or neural tissue- Spotty pigmentation such as lentigines (i.e., flat brown discoloration of skin), pigmented nevi, or both- Endocrine hyperactivity such as Cushing syndrome- Multiple cerebral fusiform aneurysms may be seen in patients with Carney syndrome.Other described syndromes associated with atrial myxomas include the following:- NAME syndrome features nevi, atrial myxoma, myxoid neurofibroma and ephelides (i.e., freckles (tanned macules found on the skin)).- LAMB syndrome features lentigines, atrial myxoma, and blue nevi.",

Long standing loss of protein leads to hypoalbuntinemia. - The loss of protein (albumin) leads to reduced colloid oncotic pressure.

        "exp": "Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous and is caused by mutations in the genes for transthyretin (TTR), apolipoprotein A1, or gelsolin. The majority of patients with FAP have mutations in the TTR gene. Amyloid deposition may be evident in abdominal fat pad, rectal, or nerve biopsies. The clinical features, histopathology, and EDx reveal abnormalities consistent with a generalized or multifocal, predominantly axonal but occasionally demyelinating, sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Must know: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the prototype of a group of inherited diseases that are characterized by recurrent episodes of fever with serosal, synol, or cutaneous inflammation and, in some individuals, the eventual development of systemic AA amyloidosis. The innate immune system, with its myeloid effector cells and germline receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns and endogenous danger signals, plays a predominant role in the pathogenesis of the autoinflammatory diseases Beta 2-m Amyloidosis is a frequent complication of long-term dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis). In fact, Beta 2-m amyloidosis is a major cause of skeletal morbidity in dialysis-dependent patients. Prions are infectious proteins that cause degeneration of the central nervous system (CNS). Prion diseases are disorders of protein conformation, the most common of which in humans is called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD typically presents with dementia and myoclonus, is relentlessly progressive, and generally causes death within a year of onset. Misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) is associated with amyloidosis.

Special stains for fungi and mycobacteria are negative. The patient works as a secretary and has no history of occupational exposure to airborne minerals or organic dusts. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is usually made by exclusion. This disease is characterized by non-necrotizing granulomas developing most frequently in the lungs, lymph nodes, retina, hea, spleen, skin, and liver. Non-necrotizing granulomas may be seen in a number of other conditions, such as infections and ceain forms of pneumoconiosis, which must be ruled out before making a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The etiopathogenesis of sarcoidosis is obscure. Cell-mediated mechanisms are thought to be involved in an immune response to as yet unidentified antigens. About two-thirds of patients with sarcoidosis recover without residual functional deficits, 20% have permanent pulmonary or visual damage, and 10% die of pulmonary or cardiac involvement.Also know:Asbestosis, berylliosis, and byssinosis are all lung diseases caused by inhalation of airborne dusts. Asbestosis is due to chronic inhalation of asbestos fibers, which may affect workers involved in installation and removal of insulation. Asbestosis leads to diffuse fibrosis of the lungs. In this case, granulomas are absent or scanty; the most characteristic sign of asbestos exposure is the asbestos body, which is an elongated beaded rod composed of asbestos fibers coated by proteins. Chronic exposure to beryllium in mining and fabrication leads to berylliosis , a granulomatous condition of the lungs indistinguishable morphologically from sarcoidosis. Clinical history is therefore essential in excluding this condition. Byssinosis results from occupational exposure to cotton fibers. This condition belongs to a diversified category of diseases mediated by a hypersensitivity reaction against inhaled organic dusts. Farmer's lung, pigeon breeder's lung, air-conditioner lung, and byssinosis are typical examples of these conditions, which lead to a granulomatous reaction that may progress to diffuse pulmonary fibrosis. Again, clinical history is crucial in the identification of this etiology. Ref: Wasfi Y.S., Fontenot A.P. (2003). Chapter 12. Sarcoidosis. In M.E. Hanley, C.H.

In addition to the lymphoid system the nervous system is a major target of HIV infection. Macrophages and microglia cells in the central nervous system that belongs to the monocyte and macrophages lineages are the predominant types in the brain that are infected with HIV. It is widely believed that HIV is carried into the brain by infected monocytes. Ninety percent of patients demonstrate some form of neurological involvement at autopsy. C.N.S. involvement in AIDS usually produces AIDS dementia complex. The pathology associated with AIDS related congnitive motor complex sometimes called subacute encephalitis is located mainly in subcoical areas with relative sparing of cerebral coex. Between 10 and 20% of I-UV-infected patients present with neurologic signs as their first clinical manifestation of infection. In some, no other signs of AIDS develop. Between 50 and 70% of all AIDS patients eventually develop some features of what is called AIDS dementia or the AIDS related cognitive-motor complex. -This term is used to describe the characteristic pattern of cognitive, motor, and behavioral dysfunction, including mood disturbances, seen in AIDS patients. At autopsy, between 60 and 90% of AIDS patients brains show some .form of pathology. Pathologic changes directly due to HIV infection (subacute encephalitis) The pathology associated with the AIDS-related cognitive-motor complex, sometimes called subacute encephalitis, is located mainly in subcoical areas, with relative sparing of cerebral coex. Microscopic changes include : - Diffuse white matter pallor - Perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes and macrophages - Foci of necrosis, gliosis, and/or demyelination Microglial nodules, macrophages and multinucleated cells Remember, Vasculitis is characteristically absent in CNS involvement in AIDS. The virus enters the brain, probably primarily by way of nacrophages, as HIV has been localized in CNS, mainly in macrophages, microglia and multinucleated giant cells. The virus is able to reproduce in the brain. Vacuolar myelopathy - Is sometimes seen in the spinal cord. This change consists of white matter vacuolation in posterior and lateral columns, and is mainly due to swelling within mhyelin sheaths.

B: X-linked recessiveAn male affected with X-linked recessive disorder does not transmit the disorder to his son, hut all daughters are carriersX-linked recessive inheritanceIt is a mode of inheritance in which a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome causes the phenotype to be expressed- In males (who are necessarily hemizygous for the gene mutation because they have only one X chromosome) and- In females who are homozygous for the gene mutation (i.e., they have a copy of the gene mutation on each of thee' two X chromosomes).X-linkec inheritance means that the gene causing the trait or the disorder is located on the X chromosome.Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome.Carrier females who have only one copy of the mutation do not usually express the phenotypeGenerally \"men are affected and women are carriers\" for two reasons.The first is the simple statistical fact that if the X-chromosomes is a population that carry a paicular X-linked mutation at a frequency of 'f' (for example, 1%) then that will be the frequency that men are likely to express the mutation (since they have only one X), while women will express it at a frequency of f2 (for example 1% *1% = 0.01%) since they have two X's and hence two chances to get the normal allele.Thus, X-linked mutations tend to be rare in women.Father can pass only Y-chromosome to his son, which is never involved in X-linked recessive conditions, as the gene, is located on the X-chromosome. Hence disease will not pass from father to son.Most common X-linked recessive disordersColor blindness; a classic example of an X-linked trait because it is relatively common.- 7% to 10% of men are red-green colorblindIts commonness may be attributable to its not being a serious disability in most cases and an actual advantage in some situations (for example, not being distracted by some of the color in color based camouflage).It is also known as daltonism.Hemophilia ADuchenne muscular dystrophy; muscular dystrophy associated with mutations in the dystrophin gene, characterized by rapid progression of muscle degeneration, eventually leading to loss in ambulation, respiratory failure and death.Becker's muscular dystrophy; milder form of Duchenne, causes slowly progressive muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis.Hemophilia B; disorder caused by a mutation of the Factor IX gene, leading to a deficiency of Factor IX. It is rarer than haemophilia A. It's also called Christmas diseaseX-linked ichthyosis; ichthyosis caused by the hereditary deficiency of the steroid sulfatase (STS) enzyme that affects 1 in 2000 to 1 in 6000 males.X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA); XLA patients do not generate mature B cells. B cells are pa of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (Immunoglobulins) which defends the body from infections (the humoral response).Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; may exhibit nonimmune hemolytic anemia in response to a number of causes, most commonly infection or exposure to ceain medications or chemicals.",

The four most frequent causes are trauma, sepsis, shock, and gastric aspiration. The pathogenesis is not entirely clear, but influx of neutrophils and release of cytokines, eicosanoids, and free radicals seem to be crucial in promoting alveolar damage. The most characteristic histopathologic hallmark of diffuse alveolar damage is formation of hyaline membranes within the alveolar cavities. These consist of proteinaceous material of plasma origin and necrotic debris from desquamated epithelium. The condition has a 60% moality and manifests with acute respiratory failure.Also Know:The pathologic features of asthma are relatively nonspecific and are similar, for example, to those of chronic bronchitis, including chronic inflammatory infiltration, hyperplasia of mucous glands, and hyperophy of smooth muscle. The presence of numerous eosinophils, however, is more characteristic of asthma. Bacterial pneumonia is characterized by intra-alveolar exudation of neutrophils, fibrin, and erythrocytes. Bacteria are also present within the alveolar cavities. Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) is a form of interstitial disease referred to as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In contrast to usual interstitial pneumonitis (another form of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), DIP is more responsive to steroid treatment. Histopathologically, DIP leads to hyperplasia of pneumocytes and accumulation of histiocytes that fill the alveolar cavities. Ref: Levy B.D., Choi A.M. (2012). Chapter 268.

This response may occur before any improvment in anemia is observed. The earliest hematological evidence of recovery is increase reticulocytes and their hemoglobin content. The reticulocytes attain a maximal value on the 5th to 10th day after institution of therapy and thereafter gradually return to nonnal. The reticulocyte response may not be detectable in mild iron deficiency anemia. The blood hemoglobin level is the most accurate measure of the degree of anemia in iron deficiency anemia. During the response to therapy, the red cell count may increase temporarily to values above normal, but the hemoglobin value lags behind. The red cell indices may remain abnormal for some time after the normal hemoglobin level is restored. As recovery occurs, a normocytic cell population gradually replaces the microcytic population; and one of the early signs of response to therapy is an increase in RBW from pretreatment level. When treatment is fully effective, hemoglobin reaches normal levels by 2 months after therapy is initiated, regardless of staing values.

        "exp": "Although it is nearly impossible to memorize the staging rules for all the different kinds of tumors, there are several basic principles common to all. The TNM stage of a tumor is determined by the tumor size and extent (T for tumor), lymph node involvement (N for nodes), and metastasis (M for metastasis). N0 always means no lymph nodes are involved. An NI lesion has positive nodes, and only 2nd choice, positive bronchial lymph nodes, changes the patient's nodal status. Involvement of the chest wall is a feature of tumor size and extent-thus, it is a component of the T in TNM-staging. T2 lesions involve the chest wall. Histological features of the tumor, such as small cell morphology , are not considered in tumor stage, but rather in tumor grade. Small cell tumors are considered high-grade carcinomas. Tumor extending to the carina reflects the tumor size and extent-thus, it is a component of the T in TNM-staging: T3 lesions involve the carina .

(5) Anti neoplastic alkylating agents as cytophosphamide.ThalassemiaInherited anemias characterized by defects in the synthesis of one or more globin chain subunits of the adult hemoglobin tetramer (Hb A).This leads to deficient hemoglobin accumulation, resulting in hypochromic and microcytic red cells and ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolytic anemia.Signs and symptoms: Thalassemia trait has no signs or symptoms.-- Pallor, Poor growth, Inadequate food intake, Fatigue, Shoness of breath, Splenomegaly, Jaundice, Maxillary hyperplasia, Dental malocclusion, Cholelithiasis, Pathologic fracturesLaboratory: In the presence of normal iron status, Increased levels of Hb A2 (to 4 to 6%) and/or increased Hb F (to 5 to 20%) by quantitative hemoglobin analysis suppos the diagnosis.Unfounately, differentiation between iron deficiency anemia and beta- or alpha-thalassemia trait can be difficult in practice if no reciprocal increases in Hb A2 levels and/or Hb F are present.- The distinction between alpha- and beta-thalassemia depends on the measurement of the minor hemoglobins Hgb A2 and Hgb F.- If these are normal, the diagnosis of alpha-thalassemia is most likely.Hemoglobin electrophoresis:- Elevated Hb A2 levels in beta-thalassemia trait- Elevated Hb A2, elevated Hb F, reduced or absent Hb Al in beta-thalassemia major or intermedia Peripheral blood:- Pronounced microcytosis,- Anisocytosis,- Poikilocytosis,- Hypochromia,- Punctate basophilic stippling,- High percentage of target cells, nucleated RBC,- Reticulocyte count elevatedHematocrit:- 28-40% in alpha-thalassemia trait and beta-thalassemia trait- May fall to less than 10% in beta-thalassemia majorFanconi anemia (FA)It is a genetic disease with an incidence of 1 per 350,000 bihsFA is the result of a genetic defect in a cluster of proteins responsible for DNA repair.As a result, the majority of FA patients develop cancer, most often acute myelogenous leukemia, and 90% develop bone marrow failure by age 40.Clinically, hematological abnormalities are the most serious symptoms in FA.While at bih, blood count is usually normal, macrocytosis/megaloblastic anemia is the first detected abnormality, often within the first decade of life (median age of onset is 7 years).Within the next 10 years, over 50% of patients presenting haematological abnormalities will have developed pancytopenia.Most commonly, a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) precedes a low neutrophil count (neutropenia)",

MRI reveals a posterior fossa tumor that fills the 4th ventricle. Surgery is immediately staed, and intraoperative consultation leads to a \"frozen section\" diagnosis of medulloblastoma. Which of the following pathologic mechanisms most likely accounts for this child's clinical presentation?",
        "exp": "Any tumor \"filling the 4th ventricle\" blocks the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This blockage leads to increased intracranial pressure, which manifests with nausea, vomiting, headache,nuchal rigidity, and mental status changes. If surgery is not performed promptly, cerebellar tonsillar herniation and rapid death will ensue. In children, medulloblastoma and ependymoma are the most frequent neoplasms presenting in this manner. There is no evidence in this case suggesting that acute hemorrhage into the 4th ventricular cavity has occurred, nor is medulloblastoma typically associated with this complication. CNS tumors that frequently bleed are metastases from melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and choriocarcinoma. Alterations in medullary function lead to cardiorespiratory instability and may be caused by direct tumor compression or infiltration of the medulla, neither of which is suppoed by MRI findings in this case. Infiltration of the cerebellar vermis is ceainly seen in many cases of medulloblastoma, a tumor that arises from this midline cerebellar structure. However, this would lead to truncal ataxia and gait instability, not symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Ref: Ropper A.H., Samuels M.A. (2009). Chapter 30.

A. Physiological (most of the time) Programmed cell death. B. Pathological Unprogrammed cell death. A.Physiological apoptosis o Death by apoptosis is a normal phenomenon that serves to eliminate cells that are no longer needed. o It is impoant in the following physiologic situation :? The programmed destruction of cells during embryogenesis, including implantation, organogenesis, and metamorphosis. Hormone dependent involution in adult, e.g., endometrial cell breakdown during menstural cycle, ovarian follicular atresia in the menopause, the regression of lactating breast after weaning, and prostatic atrophy after castration. Cell deletion in proliferating cell population in order to maintain a constant number, e.g., intestinal crypt epithelium. Death of host cells that have served their useful purpose, such as neutrophils after an acute inflammatory response, and lymphocytes at the end of an immune response. Elimination of potentially harmful self-reactive lymphocytes in thymus. Cell death induced by cytotoxic T cells to eliminate virus infected and neoplastic cells. Same mechanism occurs in graft versus host disease. B.Pathological apoptosis o Apoptosis may also be pathological. o When cells are damaged beyond repair, especially when the damage affects the cell's DNA, the irreparably damaged cells are eliminated : ? Cell death produced by injuries stimuli --> Radiation and cytotoxic anticancer drugs damage DNA, and if repair mechanisms cannot cope with the injury, the cell kills itself by apoptosis. In these situations, elimination of the cell may be a better alternative than risking mutations and translocations in the damaged DNA which may result in malignant transformation.

Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as liver and pancreas. The total body content of the iron is tightly regulated, as the daily losses are matched by gastrointestinal absorption. In hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of intestinal absorption of dietary iron is lost, leading to net iron accumulation of 0.5 to 1.0 gm/year. It may be recalled that the total body iron pool ranges from 2-6 gm in normal adults; about 0.5 gm is stored in the liver 98% of which is hepatocytes. In hemochromatosis the iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one third of which accumulates in the liver. The iron accumulation is life long, the rate of net iron accumulation is 0.5 to 1.0 gm/year. The disease manifests itself typically after 20 gm of storage iron have accumulated.

In atherosclerosis, there is hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis due to associated inflammation (remind you-atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition). So there is consistent doposition of fibrin. Lp (a) has close homology to plasminogen and it competes with plosminogen for binding on the surface of endothelium. This result in reduced generation of plasmin from plasminogen --> Inhibition of endogenous fibrinolytic system. This enhances fuher fibrin deposition. In addition, Lp (a) is accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions. So, Lp (a) causes impaired cell surface fibrinolysis and progressive atherosclerosis.",

Why do some tissues undergo hyperophy, while others undergo hyperplasia ? o The cells that have limited capacity of proliferation (e.g., myocardial cells & skeletal muscle cells) can not increase their number, So they are not able to undergo hyperplasia. But these cells can increase in size in response to increased demand, So they can undergo hyperophy. o The cells capable of division (hepatocytes, renal tubular epithelial cells, smooth muscles of uterus) have both the propeies, i.e., to increase the number as well as the size.

The cancer involves dermal lymphatics and therefore has a high incidence of systemic metastasis and a poor prognosis. If the lymphatics become blocked, then the area of skin may develop lymphedema and \"peau d'orange\" or orange peel appearance. The overlying skin in inflammatory breast cancer is usually swollen, red, and tender. Acute inflammation is a rare finding in breast cancer and may be associated with secondary infection or abscess. Chronic inflammation in breast cancer is a non-specific finding. In medullary breast cancer, a type of invasive ductal carcinoma, there are a large number of lymphocytes around the tumor and a desmoplastic reaction is often absent in the surrounding tissue. This type of cancer carries a somewhat better prognosis. Epidermal invasion by cancer cells is a poor prognostic indicator. Intraepidermal malignant cells are called Paget cells.

Before current molecular assays were available, it was the only marker detectable in the window period, the time between the disappearance of HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs.

The presence of anti-HBsAb and anti-HBcAb (IgG) indicates recovery and immunity in a previously infected individual, whereas a successful vaccination response produces antibody only to HBsAg.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Mast cells Type I hypersensitivity (Immediate hypersensitivity) o It is a rapidly developing immunological reaction occuring within minutes after the combination of an antigen with antibody bound to mast cells in individuals previously sensitized to the antigen. o Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by Ig E, but T and B cells play impoant role in the development of these antibodies. o Type I reaction requires prior sensitization to a specific antigen (allergen). o Most exposures occur either by inhalation (respiratory route) or ingestion (GIT) of antigen. o Type one hypersensitivity has two phases :- 1.Initial response o After first antigen exposure, this antigen is presented to CD-4 helper T cells (TH2 type) by antigen presenting cells. These primed TH2 cells release IL-4 that acts on B-cells to form Ig E specific for that paicular antigen. The antigen specific lg E antibodies then bind to the surface receptors of mast cells and basophils. The process from first antigen exposure to the coating of mast cells by Ig E acts as sensitization (prior sensitization) and first exposure is also called priming or sensitizing exposure (dose). Subsequent exposure (shocking dose) to same antigen then result in activation of mast cells and basophils with release of mediator from these cells that leads to ? Smooth muscle spasm Increase mucus secretion from the epithelial cells. Vasodilatation Increased vascular permeability Recuritment of inflammatory cells Note - Most of the clinical effects are due to smooth muscle spasm. 2. Late phase response In this phase additional leukocytes are recruited. These cells amplify and sustain the inflammatory response without additional exposure to the triggred antigen. Among the cells that are recruited in the late-phase reaction, eosinophils are paicularly impoant. Eosinophils produce major basic protein and eosinophilic cataionic protein that are toxic to epithelial cells. Platelet activating factor (PAF) recruits and activates inflammatory cells and is most impoant cytokine in the initatiation of late phase response. Type I hypersensitivity occurs in two forms Anaphylaxis --> Acute, potentially fatal, systemic. Atom --> Chronic, Nonfatal, Lacalized. Remember o Mast cells are the most impoant cells in type I hypersensitivity. o Eosinophils are the most impoant cells in the late phase reaction of type I hypersensitivity. o Histamine is the most impoant mediator in type I hypersensitivity. o IL-4 is paicularly impoant, it is essential for turning on IgE secreting B cells. o PAF is the most impoant cytokine in the initiation of late phase reaction. o Most potent eosinophilic activating cytokine is IL-5.",

        "exp": "The phrase \"mosaic pattern\" of newly formed woven bone is a specific tip-off for Paget's disease of bone, and is not seen in other bone conditions. The clinical and radiologic presentation are typical; an increased hat size may also be a clue. In its early stages, Paget's disease is characterised by osteolysis, producing patchwork areas of bone resorption with bizarre, large osteoclasts. In the middle stage of the disease, secondary osteoblastic activity compensates with new bone formation, producing the mosaic pattern. In late Paget's, the bones are dense and osteosclerotic. Paget's disease is suspected to be related to prior viral infection, but the cause remains mysterious. Complications include myelophthisic anemia, high output cardiac failure, pain secondary to nerve compression, deformities secondary to skeletal changes, and in about 1% of patients, osteosarcoma or other sarcoma, typically involving the jaw, pelvis, or femur. An increased incidence of astrocytomas is associated with tuberous sclerosis.Hodgkin's lymphoma is usually a disease of young adults, although older patients may have the lymphocyte-depleted form.Meningiomas are mostly benign tumors that affect adults, especially females.
