On examination, a superficial 0.5-cm laceration ceases to bleed within 5 minutes after application of local pressure. Which of the following substances is released by endothelium and is most likely to counteract platelet aggregation near this site of injury?",
        "exp": "Endothelial injury releases glycoprotein tissue factor (factor III) that drives the coagulation process and activates platelets. Adjacent intact endothelium generates prostacyclin (PGI2 ) via arachidonic acid metabolism to inhibit clot propagation beyond where it is needed. PGI2 and nitric oxide are powerful vasodilators and inhibitors of platelet aggregation. This limits thrombus formation just to the area of injury. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, which induces shape change; phospholipid, which binds fibrinogen and calcium; and platelet-activating factor are procoagulants that drive thrombosis and platelet activation. Tissue-type plasminogen activator promotes fibrinolytic activity after a thrombus has formed. Thrombomodulin binds to thrombin to form an anticoagulant that activates protein C, which then cleaves activated factor V and factor VIII. Thromboxane is generated via arachidonic acid metabolism in platelets to promote platelet activation and vasoconstriction.",

Laboratory studies show a false-positive serologic test for syphilis, normal prothrombin time (PT), elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and normal platelet count. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?",
        "exp": "These findings are characteristic of a hypercoagulable state. The patient has antibodies that react with cardiolipin, a phospholipid antigen used for the serologic diagnosis of syphilis. These so-called antiphospholipid antibodies are directed against phospholipid-protein complexes such as b2 -glycoprotein I and thrombin and are sometimes called lupus anticoagulant because they are present in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune states. Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis and repeated miscarriages. In vitro, these antibodies inhibit coagulation by interfering with the assembly of phospholipid complexes, and a \"mixing study\" with normal serum will not correct the PTT (which primarily measures factors II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII and fibrinogen in the \"intrinsic pathway\" of in vitro coagulation). In vivo, the antibodies induce a hypercoagulable state by unknown mechanisms. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is an acute consumptive coagulopathy characterized by elevated PT and PTT, and decreased platelet count. The PT and PTT are normal in patients with factor V (Leiden) mutation. Hypercholesterolemia promotes atherosclerosis over many years, and the risk of arterial thrombosis increases.

Postoperatively, she develops marked swelling of the left arm that has persisted for 6 months. Now on physical examination, her temperature is 36.9deg C. Her left arm is not tender or erythematous, and it is not painful with movement or to touch, but it is enlarged with a doughy consistency. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for these findings?",
        "exp": "The surgery disrupted lymphatic return, resulting in functional lymphatic obstruction and lymphedema of the arm. The lymphatic channels are important in scavenging fluid and protein that have leaked into the extravascular tissues from the intravascular compartment. Although the amount of fluid that is drained through the lymphatics is not great, it can build up gradually. Cellulitis is caused by an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and displays erythema, warmth, and tenderness. Congestive heart failure can lead to peripheral edema, which is most marked in dependent areas such as the lower extremities and over the sacrum (in bedridden patients). Decreased plasma oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia, or sodium and water retention with heart or renal failure, leads to more generalized edema. Phlebothrombosis leads to swelling with pain and tenderness, but it is uncommon in the upper extremities.",

This hematologic condition, termed relative polycythemia, is characterized by decreased plasma volume with a normal red cell mass. When patients suffer from burns, vomiting, excessive sweating, or diarrhea, they not only lose fluid but also suffer electrolyte disturbances. Systemic blood pressure falls with continuous dehydration, and declining perfusion eventually leads to death. Diabetes insipidus (choice C) may cause dehydration but is an unlikely choice because the patient has a history of diarrhea.
