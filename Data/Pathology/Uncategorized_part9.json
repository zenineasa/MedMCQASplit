        "exp": "Kaposi's sarcoma is a spindle cell neoplasm that is highly associated with AIDS and with the Herpes simplex virus type 8. The tumor has an appearance very similar to that of angiosarcoma-proliferating stromal cells and endothelium creating vascular channels that contain blood cells. Carcinosarcoma is a tumor that contains malignant epithelial cells and malignant stromal cells. There is no epithelial element in Kaposi's sarcoma. Although lymphoma occurs with increased frequency in AIDS, it does not resemble Kaposi's sarcoma. Lymphoma involves neoplastic lymphocytes, whereas Kaposi's sarcoma involves neoplastic vascular structures. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is an extremely poorly differentiated (anaplastic) stromal malignancy. MFH does not produce any recognizable mesenchymal structures- thus, the production of vascular structures by Kaposi's sarcoma differentiates the two tumors.

Cardiac imaging techniques demonstrate right ventricular global or regional morphologic and functional abnormalities.

Apoptotic cells express phosplzatidylserine in the outer layers of their plasma membrane. Some times thrombospondin is also expressed on the surface of apoptotic bodies. These alterations permit the early recognition of dead cells by the macrophages, resulting in phagocytosis without the release of proinflammatory cellular components. In this way apoptotic response disposes of cells with minimal compromise to the surrounding tissue. The process of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is so efficient that dead cells disappear without leaving a trace and inflammation is viually absent. Thus apoptosis is fundamentally different from necrosis which is characterized by loss of membrane integrity enzymatic digestion of cells and frequently a host reaction. In case of apoptosis, the cell membrane remains intact. The two most striking features of apoptosis are: 1.1n contrast to necrosis it does not elicit inflammation 2. Considerable apoptosis may occur in tissues before it becomes apparent in histological section (because it occurs very rapidly). Morphological changes in apoptosis 1. Cell shrinkage This is the earliest change. It is due to damage of cytoskeletal proteins that provide structural suppo to the cell. 2. Chromatic Condensation (Pyknosis) This is due to breakdown and clumping of chromatin. This is most characteristic feature of apoptosis 3.Formation of cytoplasimic blebs and apoptotic bodies ---> End stage is characterised by bleb formation. 4. Chromosomal DNA fragmentation It is due to activity of endoneuclease and caspases. 5.Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and bodies by adjacent macrophages or healthy parenchymal cells. In histological sections apoptotic cell appears as round or oval mass of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm with dens nucleus chromatin fragments. Note : Cell shrinkage and fragmentation allow the cells to be efficiently phagocytosed without release of proinflammatory cellular component.",

The regression of duct system in the course of sexual development of fetus is attributed to this mechanism. Neural tube shows discrete area of programmed cell death at several stages during development. During the development of central nervous system active remodeling occurs during synapse formation. Large number of neurons are produced and some die. Apoptosis plays a role in preserving most effective neurons. In early life apoptosis helps to get rid of inappropriate clones of lymphocytes. Even death of B & T lymphocytes and deletion of autoreactive T cells in thymus is a result of apoptotic mediation.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Chromosome pattern is 47 XXY; 'b' i.e., Mental retardation is present; `c' i.e., Hypogonadism occursKLINEFELTER SYNDROME Klinefelter syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder associated with male hypogonadism and infeility.It is defined classically by a 47, XXY karyotype with variants demonstrating additional X and Y chromosomes. (Other variants can have 48 XXXY, rarely 49 XXXXY or mosaics can be there with some cells containing normal 46, XY and others 47, XXY).o Classically, it results from meiotic non-dysjunction of sex chromosomes (40% during spermatogenesis and 60% during oogenesis). Mostly, non-dysjunction occur during 1\" meiotic division.Pathophysiology:o The addition of more than 1 extra X or Y chromosome to a male karyotype results in variable physical and cognitiveabnormalities.In general, the extent of phenotypic abnormalities, including mental retardation, is related directly to the number ofsupernumerary X chromosomes.o As the number of X chromosomes increases, somatic and cognitive development are more likely to be affected.o Gonadal development is paicularly susceptible to each additional X chromosome, resulting in seminiferous tubule dysgenesis and infeility as well as hypoplastic and malformed genitalia.Moreover, mental capacity diminishes with additional X chromosomes. The intelligence quotient (IQ) is reduced by approximately 15 points for each supernumerary X chromosome.o All major areas of development, including expressive and receptive language and coordination, are affected by extra X chromosome material.Sex :Because of an additional X chromosome on an XY background, this condition is seen in males only.Age :Most males born with Klinefelter syndrome go through life without being diagnosed. Diagnosis, when made,usually occurs in adulthood. The most common indications for karyotyping are hypogonadism and infeility. PhysicalGrowtho Infants and children have normal heights, weights, and head circumferences. About 25% have clinodactyly. Height velocity is increased by age 5 years, and adult height usually is taller than average. Affected individuals also have dispropoionately long arms and legs.Some individuals with Klinefelter variant 49, XXXXY have sho stature.Central nervous systemMost 47, XXY males have normal intelligence. Family background influences IQ. Subnormal intelligence or mental retardation may be associated with the presence of a higher number of X chromosomes.o About 70% of patients have minor developmental and learning disabilities. These may include academic difficulties, delayed speech and language acquisition, diminished sho-term memory, decreased data retrieval skills, reading difficulties, dyslexia, and attention deficit disorder.o Patients may exhibit behavioral problems and psychological distress. This may be due to poor self esteem and psychosocial development or a decreased ability to deal with stress.Psychiatric disorders involving anxiety, depression, neurosis, and psychosis are seen more commonly in this group than in the general population.Sexual characteristicso Patients may lack secondary sexual characteristics because of a decrease in androgen production. This results in sparse facial/body/sexual hair, a high-pitched voice. They have eunuchoid body habitus. o By late pubey, 30-50% of boys with Klinefelter syndrome manifest gynecomastia, which is secondary to elevatedestradiol levels and increased estradiol/testosterone ratio. The risk of developing breast carcinoma is at least 20 times higher than normal.Testicular dysgenesis (small firm testis, testis size <10 mL) may be present in postpubeal patients. o Infeility/azoospermia may result from atrophy of the seminiferous tubules. Infeility is seen in practically allindividuals with a 47, XXY karyotype. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome mosaicism (46, XY/47, XXY) can be feile.o Patients may have an increased frequency of extragonadal germ cell tumors such as embryonal carcinoma, teratoma, and primary mediastinal germ cell tumor.Cardiac and circulatory problemso Mitral valve prolapse occurs in 55% of patients. o Varicose veins occur in 20-40% of patients.o The prevalence of venous ulcers is 10-20 times higher than normal, and the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is increased.Note ?o Plasma FSH and LH levels are elevated.",

        "question": "Invasive carcinoma differs from carcinoma in situ by:March 2005",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Breached basement membrane Carcinoma in situ (CIS) is an early form of carcinoma. When dysplastic changes are marked and involves the entire thickness of the epithelium but the leasion remains confined by the basement membrane, it is referred to as carcinoma in situ. Once the tumour cells breach the basement membrane, the tumour is said to be invasive.For example, carcinoma in situ of the skin, also called Bowen's disease, is the accumulation of neoplastic epidermal cells within the epidermis only.For this reason, CIS will usually not form a tumour. Rather, the lesion is flat (in the skin, cervix, etc) or follows the existing architecture of the organ (in the breast, lung, etc). Some CIS, however, form tumours, for example colon polyps or papillary cancer of the bladder as well as some CIS of the breast (more properly called Ductal Carcinoma in situ). Many forms of invasive carcinoma originate from a CIS lesion.Therefore, CIS is considered a precursor or incipient form of cancer that may, if left untreated long enough, transform into a malignant neoplasm.These terms are related since they represent the three steps of the progression toward cancer:Dysplasia is the earliest form of pre-cancerous lesion recognizable in a biopsyDysplasia can be low grade or high grade. The risk of low-grade dysplasia transforming into cancer is low.Carcinoma in situ is synonymous with high-grade dysplasia in most organs. The risk of transforming into cancer is high.Invasive carcinoma, commonly called cancer, is the final step in this sequence.",

Which of the following is the MOST likely pathogenetic mechanism of this patient's anemia?",
        "exp": "Autoimmune gastritis is characterized by atrophy and chronic inflammation of mucosa of the fundus and body of the stomach. This form of gastritis is due to an autoimmune response mediated by autoantibodies against intrinsic factor (IF). Most such autoantibodies block binding of vitamin B12 to IF (\"blocking\" antibodies), thus preventing absorption of vitamin B12. The resultant picture is megaloblastic anemia, with abnormally large (macrocytic) erythrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils.Also know:Chronic blood loss and deficient iron absorption cause iron deficiency anemia, with the former being the most common etiology in industrialized countries. Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by small (microcytic) erythrocytes (mean corpuscular volume < 80 mm3). H. pylori infection is an impoant pathogenetic factor in chronic gastritis affecting the antral mucosa in isolation, or in association with involvement of the body of the stomach. Chronic inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration of the mucosa is found on biopsy, and H. pylori can be demonstrated by appropriate silver staining. H. pylori-associated chronic gastritis is usually asymptomatic or manifests with mild and nonspecific upper abdominal discomfo. There is a strong association between H. pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease. H. pylori is also suspected to play an etiologic role in gastric lymphoma and carcinoma.

This pooling of saliva causes a\u00a0 pressure build-up and dilates the duct of the minor salivary gland. This dilated ductal epithelium forms a lining around the saliva and mimics a cyst-like lesion.\nRanula is the clinical term for a mucocele occurring on the floor of the mouth after trauma to components of the sublingual glands. Two varieties of ranula exist: cystic (mucus retention cyst) and pseudocystic (mucus retention phenomenon or mucocele). In the cystic type, there is partial obstruction of the distal end of a sublingual gland duct that results in a small epithelial lined cyst usually less than 1 cm in diameter. However, the pseudocystic type, which is more common, forms as a result of extravasation of mucus into the fibrous connective tissue after a tear in a sublingual gland duct and, as in the case of a mucocele, arises as a result of the escape of mucus into the adjacent connective tissue. The clinical term 'plunging ranula' is used when extravasated mucus dissects through the mylohyoid muscle and along the fascial planes of the neck, producing a swelling evident in the floor of the mouth.\u00a0\nKey concept:\nRanula is specifically for this mucocele occurring on the floor of the mouth after trauma to components of the sublingual glands.\nJohn S.

On section, they reveal a thin wall lined by an opaque, grey-white, wrinkled, apparent epidermis.\nGenerally, in one area of the cyst wall, a solid prominence is seen known as Rokitansky's protuberance where tissue elements such as tooth, bone, cartilage & various other odd tissues are present.\nOn histologic examination, the cyst wall is composed of stratified squamous epithelium with underlying sebaceous glands, hair shafts, and other skin adnexal structures. In most cases, structures from other germ layers can be identified, such as cartilage, bone, thyroid tissue, and other organoid formations.\nDermoid cysts are sometimes incorporated within the wall of a mucinous cystadenoma.\nAbout 1% of the dermoids undergo malignant transformation of any one of the component elements ( but most commonly, squamous cell carcinoma).\n\n(2) Monodermal or Specialized Teratomas\n\nThe rare group of tumors, the most common of which are struma ovarii and carcinoid.\nThey are always unilateral, although a contralateral teratoma may be present.\nStruma ovarii is composed entirely of mature thyroid tissue. Interestingly, these thyroidal neoplasms may hyperfunction, causing hyperthyroidism.\nThe ovarian carcinoid, which presumably arises from intestinal epithelium in a teratoma, might, in fact, be functioning, particularly in large tumors, producing 5-hydroxytryptamine and the carcinoid syndrome.\n\n(3) Immature Malignant Teratomas\n\nThese are rare tumors that differ from benign teratomas in that the component tissue resembles that observed in the fetus or embryo rather than in the adult.\nThe tumor is found chiefly in prepubertal adolescents and young women.\nThese grow rapidly and frequently penetrate the capsule with local spread or metastases.\nOn microscopy, there are varying amounts of immature tissue differentiating toward cartilage, glands, bone, muscle, nerve, and others.\nAn important risk for the subsequent extraovarian spread is the histologic grade of tumor, which is based on the proportion of tissue containing immature neuroepithelium.",

        "exp": "Atherosclerosis of coronary aeries is the underlying pathologic change in the great majority of cases of ischemic hea disease. Ischemic hea disease may manifest with several clinical syndromes depending on distribution and morphology of atherosclerotic changes and rate of progression. A slowly progressive increase in luminal stenosis in all major coronary vessels results in diffuse ischemia of the myocardium and dropout of scattered myocytes throughout the ventricular walls. Eventually, such a reduction in myocardial mass will lead to decreased contractility and hea failure. Patients with this chronic ischemic hea disease often come to clinical attention with signs and symptoms of congestive hea failure, sometimes without any history of chest pain or arrhythmias.Myocardial infarction may be clinically silent (ie, without pain), although it is usually associated with severe chest pain. If the infarct is extensive, cardiogenic shock ensues. All forms of angina can be easily ruled out as correct choices since angina indicates, by definition, paroxysmal chest pain due to reversible myocardial ischemia. Prinzmetal angina is an uncommon form of angina occurring at rest and caused by vasospasm. Stable angina refers to chest pain with a predictable pattern of onset, usually after physical effos, emotional excitement, or any cause of increased cardiac load.

A: Fundal glands of intestineCalcification refers to the deposition of calcium salts in vital or dying/ dead tissues.The two classical types of calcification are dystrophic and metastatic.Dystrophic calcification refers to the deposition of calcium salts in dead or dying tissues.It occurs principally in areas of coagulative, liquefactive, caseous and/or fat necrosis that persist for rather long periods of time.Dystrophic calcification occurs in the presence of normal levels of serum calcium (around 10 mg/100 ml) and in the absence of derangement in calcium metabolism.The exact form that the calcium accumulates in is hydroxyapatite.Calcification in dead tissue:- Caseous necrosis in T.B. is most common site of dystrophic calcification.Liquefactive necrosis in chronic abscesses may get calcified.Fat necrosis following acute pancreatitis or traumatic fat necrosis in breasts results in deposition of calcium soaps.Infarcts may undergo D.C.Thrombi, esp. in veins, may produce phleoboliths.Haematomas in the vicinity of bones may undergo D.C.Dead parasites like schistostoma eggs show D.C.Congenital toxoplasmosis involving CNS visualised by calcification in infarct brain.Calcification in the degenerated tissueDense scars may undergo hyalinedegeneration and calcification.Atheroma in aoa and coronaries frequently undergo calcification.Cysts can show calcifcation.Calcinosis cutis is condition in which there are irregular nodular deposits of calcium salts in skin and subcutaneous tissue.Senile degenerative changes may be accompanied by calcification.Metastatic calcification refers to the deposition of calcium salts in vital tissues in association with a defect in calcium metabolism that is characterized by hypercalcemia. The usual causes of the hypercalcemia include Hyperparathyroidism, either primary or secondary,Vitamin-D intoxication,Deficiency of magnesium andHypercalcemia of malignancy.Metastatic calcification may occur widely throughout the body, but it is found principally in interstitial tissue of blood vessels, kidneys, lungs and gastric mucosa.Calcinosis is a term sometimes used to describe extensive metastatic calcification.Calciphylaxis is the process whereby calcium precipitates in tissues in response to a challenging agent such as iron.",

Clinically the most widely used method is indirect immunofluorescence. The pattern of fluorescence suggests the type of antibody present in the patient's serum.ANA screening yields positive results in many connective tissue disorders and other autoimmune diseases, and may occur in normal individuals.Subtypes of antinuclear antibodies include anti-Smith and anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies (which are linked to SLE) and anti-histone antibodies (which are linked to drug-induced lupus).Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE; they are present in 70% of cases, whereas they appear in only 0.5% of people without SLE.The anti-dsDNA antibody titers also tend to reflect disease activity, although not in all cases.",

C: Histological features are different from alcoholic steatohepatitis Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes simple hepatic steatosis, steatosis accompanied by minor, non-specific inflammation, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH is a common, often \"silent\" liver disease. NASH is usually first suspected in a person who is found to have elevations in liver tests that are included in routine blood test panels, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspaate aminotransferase (AST). When fuher evaluation shows no apparent reason for liver disease (such as medications, viral hepatitis, or excessive use of alcohol) and when x-rays or imaging studies of the liver show fat, NASH is suspected. The only means of proving a diagnosis of NASH and separating it from simple fatty liver is a liver biopsy. NASH is diagnosed when examination of the tissue with a microscope shows fat along with inflammation and damage to liver cells. If the tissue shows fat without inflammation and damage, simple fatty liver or NAFLD is diagnosed. NASH is characterized by steatosis and multifocal parenchymal inflammation, mainly neutrophils, Mallory bodies, hepatocyte death (both ballooning degeneration and apoptosis), and sinusoidal fibrosis. Fibrosis also occurs within poal tracts and around terminal hepatic venules. These histological features are similar to those of alcoholic steatohepatitis.",

Phosphatidyl serine on the outer leaflet is available to bind labelled annexin V providing the basis for a simple staining assay. All of the annexin proteins share the propey of binding calcium and phospholipids. Annexin V is a cause of syndrome called antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Annexin V normally forms a shield around ceain phospholipid molecules that blocks their entry into coagulation (clotting) reactions.

A: Pancreatic carcinoma CA 19-9 is tumour marker for colon cancer and pancreatic cancer CA19-9/ Carbohydrate antigen 19-9/ Cancer antigen 19-9/ Sialylated Lewis (a) antigen It was discovered in patients with colon cancer and pancreatic cancer in 1981. Increased levels of CA19-9 are also found in non-malignant conditions, such as Mirizzi's syndrome and diseases of the bile ducts and liver. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology discourage the use of CA19-9 as a test for cancer, paicularly pancreatic cancer. The reason is that the test may be falsely normal (false negative) in many cases, or abnormally elevated in people who have no cancer at all (false positive). The main use of CA19-9 is therefore to see whether a pancreatic tumor is secreting it; if that is the case, then the levels should fall when the tumor is treated, and they may rise again if the disease recurs. In patients who lack the Lewis antigen (a blood type protein on red blood cells), which is about 5% of the population, CA19-9 is not elevated in pancreatic cancer even with large tumors because they have a deficiency of a fucosyltransferase enzyme that is needed to produce CA19-9 as well as the Lewis antigen",

Both CD4+ and CD8+\u00a0T cells recognize and attack host tissues.\nIn clinical practice,\u00a0GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between HLA\u00a0matched donor and recipient.\n\nPathological changes in GVH diseases\n\nThere are three principal target tissues\u00a0affected in GVHD: Skin, liver, and gut.

Denudation\u00a0of epidermis (separation\u00a0of epidermis from dermis),\n2. Gut\n\nThe primary clinical manifestation\u00a0of gut GVHD is diarrhoea and abdominal pain. There is\u00a0lymphocytic\u00a0infiltrate at the crypts with accompanied necrosis and drop out of crypt cells.\n\n3. Liver\n\nLymphocytic\u00a0infiltrates in the interlobular and marginal bile ducts are characteristic\u00a0histopathologic findings. This results in hepatitis\u00a0with necrosis of hepatocytes and bites duct\u00a0epithelial cells. There is inflammation\u00a0of the parenchyma and portal tracts. These findings\u00a0lead to a clinically identifiable cholestatic\u00a0picture.\n\nB) Chronic GVHD\n\nIt occurs after 100 days of bone marrow transplantation. Manifestations\u00a0are:-\n\n1. Skin\n\nExtensive cutaneous injury, with the destruction of skin appendages and fibrosis of the dermis.\n\n2. Gut\n\nDamage to GIT may result in necrosis, ulceration\u00a0fibrosis and strictures.\n\n3.

        "exp": "Autoimmune destruction of parietal cells would lead to decreased secretion of gastric acid and intrinsic factor. The diminished availability of intrinsic factor would result in poor absorption of dietary vitamin B12. Over time, the vitamin B12 deficiency could lead to pernicious anemia, which is characterized by increased production of macrocytes (megaloblasts) by the bone marrow. Because of the decrease in gastric acid secretion, luminal bacteria would most likely exhibit increased (not decreased) growth. One of the functions of HCl secreted by the parietal cells is to sterilize the gastric lumen. Patients with Type A gastritis have an increased likelihood of developing gastric carcinoma (not decreased,). A decrease in acid secretion leads to increased secretion of gastrin (not decreased) by antral G cells. This is because low gastric pH (less than 3) inhibits gastrin secretion paracrine release of somatostatin from cells in the gastric mucosa that can sense the acidity. With decreased parietal cells, the pH of the gastric lumen would rise and remove this inhibitory component. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J.F., Moos P.J., Mackey D.C., Brown T.G. (2008). Chapter 14.

        "question": "Hypocalcemia is seen with which of the following:September 2008",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Acute pancreatitisHypoalbuminemia is the most common cause of hypocalcemia and is due to cirrhosis, nephrosis, malnutrition, burns, chronic illness, and sepsis.Hypomagnesemia causes end-organ resistance to PTH and inhibits the hypocalcemic feedback loop through unceain mechanisms. Causes of hypomagnesemia include pancreatitis, aminoglycoside treatment, amphotericin B, loop diuretics, alcoholism, and malnutrition.Hyperphosphatemia may be seen in critical illness and in patients who have ingested phosphate-containing enemas. Phosphate binds calcium avidly, causing acute hypocalcemia.Multifactorial causes are probably the most clinically relevant hypocalcemic emergencies include the following:- Acute pancreatitis: Free fatty acids chelate calcium, causing saponification in the retroperitoneum.- Rhabdomyolysis: Increased phosphates from creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and other anions (i.e., lactate, bicarbonate) chelate calcium.- Sepsis can cause hypocalcemia through many mechanisms.- Toxic shock syndrome can cause hypocalcemia.High calcitonin levels cause low calcium.- Malignancy: Osteoblastic metastases (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer) and tumor lysis syndrome may cause hypocalcemia (by differing mechanisms).- Hepatic or renal insufficiency: Calciuresis, hypomagnesemia, hypoalbuminemia, and low active vitamin D levels may contribute to poor calcium homeostasis.- Infiltrative disease: Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and hemochromatosis may infiltrate the parathyroids, causing dysfunction.-- Toxicologic causes include hydrofluoric acid burn or ingestion.Enhanced protein binding and anion chelation- Protein binding is enhanced by elevated pH and free fatty acid release in high catecholamine states.Anion chelation is seen in high phosphate states (e.g., renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, mesenteric ischemia, oraladministration of phosphate-containing enemas); high citrate states (e.g., massive blood transfusion, radiocontrastdyes); and high bicarbonate, lactate, and oxalate levels.Medication effects- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid production resulting in reduced calcium absorption.- Selective serotonin inhibitors can have a calcium antagonistic effect on smooth muscle, paicularly vascular endothelium.- Calcitonin and bisphosphonates cause chelation and end-organ inhibition.- Phenobarbital and phenytoin enhance vitamin D catabolism and decrease calcium resorption in the gut.Foscarnet complexes with calcium.Fluoride, paicularly hydrofluoric acid, chelates calcium avidly and causes profound hypocalcemia. Ethylene glycol complexes with calcium.Estrogen inhibits bone resorption.Cimetidine decreases gastric pH, slowing fat breakdown, which is necessary to complex calcium for gut absorption.Aluminum and alcohol suppress PTH.Gadolinium-based contrast material can falsely lower serum calcium levels and should be considered if levels are drawn sholy after magnetic resonance imaging.Postsurgical effectsParathyroid adenoma resection causes a transient hypocalcemia due to end-organ PTH resistance in the first postoperative day.Pancreatectomy prevents calcium absorption in the duodenum and the jejunum by eliminating necessary enzymes.Small bowel syndrome causes hypocalcemia by reducing the surface available to absorb fatty acids and calcium.PTH deficiency/resistanceInfiltrative diseases include Wilson disease and metastatic cancer.Pseudohypoparathyroidism is due to PTH resistance and has many forms, most notably Albright disease. Renal failure can result in a variety of endocrine disorders, occasionally including hypocalcemia.Vitamin D deficiency/resistance- Rickets may be due to lack of vitamin D or end-organ receptor resistance.- Hepatorenal disease: The liver and the kidney provide intermediary enzymes to form active 1,25 (OH)2 D.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Liver Amebic liver abscess is the most frequent extraintestinal manifestation of Entamoeba histolytica infection. This infection is caused by the protozoa E histolytica, which ascends the poal venous system. Amebic liver abscess is an impoant cause of space-occupying lesions of the liver, mainly in developing countries E histolytica exists in 2 forms. The cyst stage is the infective form, and the trophozoite stage causes invasive disease. People who chronically carry E histolytica shed cysts in their feces; these cysts are transmitted primarily by food and water contamination. Cysts are resistant to gastric acid, but the wall is broken down by trypsin in the small intestine. Trophozoites are released and colonize the cecum. To initiate symptomatic infection, E histolytica trophozoites present in the lumen must adhere to the underlying mucosa and penetrate the mucosal layer. Liver involvement occurs following invasion of E histolytica into mesenteric venules. Amebae then enter the poal circulation and travel to the liver where they typically form large abscesses. The abscess contains acellular proteinaceous debris, which is thought to be a consequence of induced apoptosis and is surrounded by a rim of amebic trophozoites invading the tissue. The right lobe of the liver is more commonly affected than the left lobe. This has been attributed to the fact that the right lobe poal laminar blood flow is supplied predominantly by the superior mesenteric vein, whereas the left lobe poal blood flow is supplied by the splenic vein.",

        "exp": "Cytochrome C activation A large number of agents cause genetic damage and can induce neoplastic transformation. They include - Chemical carcinogens - Radiant energy - Oncogenic viruses Chemical carcinogens Chemical have long been associated with cancers. Chemical carcinogens are extremely diverse structure. They fall into mainly two categories:- i) Direct acting compounds - They dot not require chemical transformation in the body for their carcinogenicity. ii) Indirect acting compounds -They require metabolic conversion in vivo to produce ultimate carcinogens capable of transforming cells. - Carcinogens can also be inactivated in the body through ceain metabolic pathways. - Thus the carcinogenic potency of a chemical is determined not only by the inherent reactivity of its electrophile derivatives but also by the balance between activation and inactivation reactions. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process: -Initiation During this process a carcinogen (initiator) initiates a cell into carcinogenesis. After a sufficient exposure to the carcinogen, the cell undergoes alteration. All initiating chemical carcinogens are highly reactive electrophiles (have electron deficient atoms) that can react with nucleophiles (electron rich) sites in the cell. Their targets are DNA, RNA and proteins - An initiator cell causes unrepaired alteration in the DNA. - Unrepaired alteration in the DNA is the essential first step in the process of initiation. For the change to be heritable the damged DNA template must be replicated. - Thus for initiation to occur, carcinogen altered cells must undergo at least one cycle of proliferation so that the changes in DNA becomes fixed. Promotion Initiation alone is not sufficient for tumor formation the altered initiator cell has to undergo promotion. Promoters can induce tumors in initiated cells but they are nontumorigenic by themselves. In contrast to the effect of initiators, cellular changes resulting from application of promoters do not affect the DNA directly and are reversible. Fuher more, tumours do not result when the promoting agent is applied before rather than after the initiating agent. The promoters lead to proliferation and clonal expansion of initiated (mutated cells). - When initiator cells proliferate under the influence of promoters they undergo additional mutations developing eventually into a malignant cell. General scheme of events in chemical carcinogenesis Benzopyrine is a polycyclic Aromatic hydrocarbon - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are one of the most potent carcinogens known. - They are of paicular interest as carcinogens because they are produced in the combustion of tobacco paicularly with cigarette smoking. Benzopyrene is ,found in coaltar, automobile exhaust fumes, smoke from combustion of organic material and in charbroiled. food. It requires metabolic conversion in the body to exe its biological effect like most of the known carcinoma it is metabolized by p450 dependent mono-oxygenase - About 10% of white population has a highly inducible form of one of p450 enzyme (CYPIA1). - This enzyme is induced by Benzopyrene present in cigarette smoke and leads to cancer. First step Cytochrome P450 (cYP 1A1) catalyzes the initial epoxidation. Second step Epoxide hydrolase catalyzes the formation dihydrodiols. Third step Dihydrodiols is fuher metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP 1A1) to form vicinal-dioL-epoxide. Fouh step The highly unstable vicinal-diol-epoxide opens spontaneously to .form carhocation. It gives a highly reactive carbonium ion that can form a covalent addition product (i.e., adduct) with cellular macromolecules including DNA and leads to carcinogenesis. Benzopyrene is metabolized bycytochrome p450 and epoxide hydrolase to from ultimate carcinogen -->benzopyrene-7,8 diol 9,10 epoxide-2.

Alcohol is one of the most frequent causes of liver steatosis. At least in pa, the mechanism of alcohol-induced steatosis is due to acetaldehyde formation, which disrupts microtubules and increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio. Fatty change of the macrovesicular type is entirely reversible if the noxious stimulus (in this case, excessive alcohol intake) is removed. Acute hepatitis results from acute insults to the liver. Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by hepatocyte necrosis, intracytoplasmic hyaline bodies (Mallory bodies), and neutrophilic infiltration. Usually, alcoholic hepatitis develops after a bout of heavy alcohol consumption. Fatty change may be superimposed on histologic signs of hepatitis, but steatosis does not evolve into hepatitis if alcohol intake is discontinued. Chronic hepatitis may result from long-term heavy alcohol consumption and is characterized by chronic inflammation of poal spaces and progressive fibrosis. Steatosis is usually associated with chronic hepatitis due to alcohol. Hyperplastic nodules represent a morphologic component of cirrhosis.

The mutant RAS protein can bind to GAP but their GTPase activity fails to be augumented. Therefore the mutant RAS\u00a0proteins are trapped in their excited GTP bound form.

A very large variety of other systemic and primary glomerular disease may occasionally cause rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, but this is usually not the typical presentation for these diseases. Diabetic nephropathy typically begins with microalbuminuria and hypeension and progresses over a 10 to 20 year period to renal failure. Hypeensive nephropathy due to essential hypeension typically presents with slowly rising BUN and creatinine; hypeensive nephropathy due to malignant hypeension presents with more rapidly rising BUN and creatinine. Lupus nephritis can have many presentations, but the most typical is proteinuria, which may be severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome.

Biopsy specimens from enlarged lymph nodes in the early stages of HIV infection reveal a marked follicular hyperplasia Patients of CLL are often asymptomatic at diagnosis. When symptoms appear, they are nonspecific and include easy fatiguability, weight loss, and anorexia. Generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are present in 5060% of symptomatic patients. Proliferation centres (on microscopy) are pathognomic for CLL/ Small lymphocytic lymphoma. Smudge cells may be seen Hodgkins lymphoma most commonly presents as painless lymphadenopathy. Patients with disseminated disease (stage III-IV) or the mixed cellularity or lymphocyte depletion subtypes are more likely to have constitutional symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Identification of Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants is essential for the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma Systemic symptoms in localized secondary TB, often appear early in the course and include malaise, anorexia, weight loss, and fever. Commonly the fever is low grade and remittent (appearing late each afternoon and then subsiding), and night sweats occur. Regional lymph nodes are less prominently involved early in secondary disease than they are in primary disease. Histologically, sites of active involvement are marked by a characteristic granulomatous inflammatory reaction that forms both caseating and non-caseating tubercles.",

Gene mutationso The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations.o These may of different types depending whether it involves complete gene or single base ?(a) Point mutationA single nucleotide base is subustituted by a different base.When a pyrimidine base is subustituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine ---> Transition.When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa --> Transversion.This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i.e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product.Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation. o Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in 13-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine.Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon.o Example is13-thalassemia in which CAG codon in f3-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation.(b) Deletion and inseionsDeletion or inseion of one or two base lead to alterations in the reading frame of the DNA strand frame shift mutation.If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three framshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized.(c) Trinucleotide repeat mutationo Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide.In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain.o For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG.2.Chromosome mutationo Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome.3.Genome mutationo Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e.g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",

Polyps tend to form at pubey with the average age of diagnosis around 25 years of age. In almost all patients, polyps will progress to malignancy, resulting in colorectal cancer so that timely detection is essential. Clinical features of Gardner syndrome can be divided into two types, cutaneous and non-cutaneous. The most noticeable cutaneous feature of Gardner syndrome is the appearance of epidermoid cysts. These cysts can be differentiated from ordinary epidermoid cysts by the following factors: - Epidermoid cysts of Gardner syndrome occur at an earlier age (around pubey) than ordinary cysts - Epidermoid cysts occur in less common locations such as the face, scalp and extremities compared to ordinary cysts - Cysts tend to be multiple in over half of the patients with Gardner syndrome As with ordinary epidermoid cysts, cysts in Gardner syndrome are usually asymptomatic (without symptoms), however in some cases they may be pruritic (itchy) and/or inflamed, and they may rupture. Other cutaneous features include fibromas, lipomas, leiomyomas, neurofibromas and pigmented skin lesions. Non-cutaneous features include: - Gastrointestinal polyps that nearly always transform into colonic adenocarcinomas (colon cancer). - Osteomas - these benign bone tumours are essential in making the diagnosis of Gardner syndrome. They occur most commonly in the mandible (jawbone) but may also grow in the skull and long bones. - Dental abnormalities - as well as osteomas in the jaw there may be other dental abnormalities such as unerupted extra teeth and caries - Multifocal pigmented lesions of the fundus in the eye - seen in 80% of patients.

        "exp": "Neurofibromatosis type 1, or von Recklinghausen disease, is an autosomal dominant disorder with high penetrance, but variable expressivity. The disease has three major features: (1) multiple neural tumors anywhere on or in the body (2) numerous pigmented cutaneous lesions (cafe au lait spots); and (3) pigmented iris hamaomas (Lisch nodules). Electron micrographic studies show that the tumors are the result of the proliferation of fibroblasts or Schwann cells in the peripheral nerves, possibly due to ras inactivation. There is no treatment, except for surgical resection of symptomatic tumors. Ependymoma can occur wherever ependymal cells are found. They are more common in children, and most often originate in the fouh ventricle. They are the most common intramedullary glioma of the spinal cord. Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by severe degeneration of the caudate nucleus along with degenerative changes in the putamen and coex. In addition to chorea, these patients frequently suffer from athetoid movements, progressive dementia, and behavioral disorders. Marfan syndrome is due to a defect in the gene for fibrillin. The major clinical findings involve the skeleton, cardiovascular system, and the eye. Affected individuals tend to be tall with long extremities and long, tapering appendages. Mitral valve prolapse and dilatation of the aoic valve ring or aoic dissection due to cystic medial degeneration are common.",

This produces the principal physical finding of mitral valve prolapse on cardiac auscultation i.e. o The midsystolic click a hipth pitched sound of sho duration. The midsystolic click may be loud or soft and varies in its timing according to left ventricular loading and contractility It is caused by the sudden tensing of the mitral valve apparatus as the leaflets billow into the left atrium during systole. Multiple systolic clicks may be generated by different poions of the mitral leaflets prolapsing at different times during systole. The midsystolic click is frequently followed by a late systolic murmur usually medium to high pitched and loudest at the apex. The murmur is produced by systolic leak of small amount of blood through the defective mitral valve during systole (mitral regurgitation murmur).",

When this gene is mutated to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic changes.The first tumor-suppressor protein discovered was the Retinoblastoma protein (pRb/RB1) in human retinoblastoma. Another impoant tumor suppressor is the p53 tumor-suppressor protein encoded by the TP53 gene.Homozygous loss of p53 is found in 70% of colon cancers, 30-50% of breast cancers, and 50% of lung cancers. Mutated p53 is also involved in the pathophysiology of leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas, and neurogenic tumors. Abnormalities of the p53 gene can be inherited in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which increases the risk of developing various types of cancers. PTEN acts by opposing the action of PI3K, which is essential for anti-apoptotic, pro-tumorogenic Akt activation.NFl somatic mutations is associated with neuroblastomas and neurofibromatosis type 1 is associated with inherited mutations of NFl.Other examples of tumor suppressors include APC, SMAD2, SMAD4 and ST14.",

        "question": "True about metastatic calcification aEUR'",
        "exp": "Calcification stas in mitochondria Calcification The deposition of mineral salts of calcium is a normal process in the formation of bone and cailage. Calcium entry into dead or dying cells is usual, owing to the inability of such cells to maintain a steep calcium gradient. Pathological calcification Pathological calcification is the abnormal deposition of calcium salts in soft tissue. It is of two types A) Metastatic Metastatic calcification reflects deranged calcium metabolism. Its a change associated with an increased calcium concentration in the serum. In general almost any disorder that increases the serum calcium level can lead to calcification in locations as the alveolar septa of the lung, renal tubules and blood vessels. The fundamental abnormality is the pathological entry of large amount of ionic calcium into the cell organelle, chiefly the mitochondria (it is suggested that mitochondria are the organelles firvt involved in the pathogenesis of metastatic calcification). Sites of metastatic calcification - Basement membrane & tubular lamina of kidney - Alveolar wall of lungs (most common site) - Interstitial tissue of gastric mucosa - Systemic aeries - Pulmonary veins - Cornea & conjunctiva - Synovium of the joint - Tendons These sites are prone to calcification because these tissues loose acid and therefore have alkaline internal environment. Alkaline pH ours precipitation of calcium salts. B) Dystrophic calcification Dystrophic calcification refers to the macroscopic deposition of calcium salts in injured tissues. This type of calcification does not simply reflect an accumulation of calcium derived from the bodies of dead cells, but rather represents an extracellular deposition of calcium from the circulation or interstitial fluid. Denatured proteins in dead or irreversible damaged tissue preferentially bind phosphate ions. Phosphate ions react with calcium ions to form a precipitate or calcium phosphate. Thus necrotic tissue serve as calcium sink. In many locations such as in a case of tuberculous caseous necrosis in the lung or lymph nodes, calcification has no functional consequences. Dystrophic calcification may also occur in crucial locations such as in mitral or aoic valves after rheumatic fever. In such instances calcification leads to impeded blood flow because it produces inflexible valve leaflets and narrowed valve orifice (mitral and aoic stenosis). Dystrophic calcification in atherosclerotic coronary aery contributes to narrowing of vessels. Dystrophic calcification also plays a role in diagnostic radiography. - Mammography is based principally on the detection of calcification in breast cancers. - Diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis and infection involving the central nervous system is suggested by visualization of calcification in the infant brain.",

        "exp": "At least 10% to 15% of normally feilized and implanted ova are lost in the first trimester of pregnancy because of spontaneous aboion. Studies using immunoassay of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for early diagnosis of pregnancy suggest that the percentage of feilized ova lost in the first trimester might be even higher. The great majority of these cases are attributable to chromosomal abnormalities. Chromosomal studies are not routinely performed in such cases, but they are recommended when a malformed fetus has been identified or when habitual or recurrent aboions occur. Abruptio placentae, a complication of the third trimester, occurs when the placenta detaches prematurely from its implantation site. Retroplacental hemorrhage develops within the space between placenta and uterine wall, leading to interruption or severe reduction in the blood supply to the fetus. Chorioamnionitis, a complication of the second and third trimesters, results from ascending infections through the vaginal canal. Infection of chorioamniotic membranes may lead to premature rupture of membranes and aboion or premature labor. Placenta pre is a placenta implanted in the lower segment of the uterus. When dilatation of this segment begins in late pregnancy, a placenta pre may cause severe bleeding and lead to premature labor. Ref: Kipps T.J. (2010). Chapter 94.
