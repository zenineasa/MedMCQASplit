Because of the increase in calcific aortic stenosis and the reduced frequency of RHD. rheumatic aortic stenosis now accounts for less than 10% of cases of acquired aortic stenosis.Fibrous bridging across the valvular commissures and calcification create \"fish mouth\" or \"buttonhole\" stenoses.With tight mitral stenosis, the left atrium progressively dilates and may harbor mural thrombi in the appendage or along the wall, either of which can embolize.Microscopically, in the mitral leaflets there is organization of the acute inflammation and 'subsequent diffuse fibrosis and neovascularization that obliterate the originally layered and avascular leaflet architecture.",

The exceptions are chorea and indolent carditis, which may follow prolonged latent periods lasting up to 6 months. Syndenham's Chorea - commonly occurs in the absence of other manifestations, follows a prolonged latent period after group A streptococcal infection, and is found mainly in females.
