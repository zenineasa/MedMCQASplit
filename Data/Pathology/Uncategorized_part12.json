Type I - severe- II Type mild Classic EDS --> Involvement of both joints & skin. Type III - Hypermobile EDS --> Joints > skin Type IV - Vascular EDS --> Vascular and intestinal intAolvement. Type V --> Similar to classic Type VI - Occular scliotic EDS --> Eye and spine involvement. Type VII - Dermatosparactic EDS --> Dysmorphic features Type VIII --> Perodontal EDS --> Dental involvement.o EDS shows all patterns of mendelian inheritance ?Type I, II, III, IV, VII A & B, VIII Autosomal dominant.Type IV & VII C ----> Autosomal recessiveType V X-linked recessive.o Clinical manifestations 1.

Oxygen deprivation causes shift of calcium from mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Increased level of calcium in the cytosol activates endogenous phospholipases from ischaemic tissue which degrade membrane phospholipids progressively which are the main constituent of the lipid bilayer membrane.
