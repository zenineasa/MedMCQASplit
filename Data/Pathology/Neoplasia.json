This allow time for DNA repair.b) DNA repair: p-53 also helps in DNA repair directly by inducing transcription of GADD 45 (growth arrest and DNA damage). GADD 45 encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair.* If DNA damage is repaired successfully, p53 activate MDM-3 and this MDM-3 induce degradation of p-53 - Relieve in cell cycle block. If DNA damage cannot be successfully repaired, p53 induces apoptosis by inducing the activation of apoptosis inducing gene BAX. So p-53 prevents replication of cell with defective DNA - p53 functions as a critical gatekeeper against formation of cancer. Mutation in p53 leads to carcinogenesis because of loss of above protective mechanism.",

Neurologic abnormalities may occur in local tumor growth impinging on nerves, but dull constant pain is the most likely abnormality in malignant neoplasms that invade nerves.

They may also cause mutations in the gene into which they insert or alter the expression of nearby genes.* In contrast to plasmids or bacterial viruses, transposons cannot replicate independently of the recipient DNA. More than one transposon can be located in the DNA for example, resistance genes. Thus, transposons can jump from:# The host genomic DNA to a plasmid# One plasmid to another# A plasmid to genomic DNA.* An insertion sequence is a short DNA sequence that acts as a simple transposable element. Insertion sequences have two major characteristics: they are small relative to other transposable elements (generally around 700 to 2500bp in length) and only code for proteins implicated in the transposition activity (they are thus different from other transposons, which also carry accessory genes such as antibiotic resistance genes.",

Knudson's hypothesis refers specifically to the heterozygosity of tumor suppressor genes.* RB gene is a tumor suppressor gene & typical example of this hypothesis.* Knudson noted that inherited retinoblastoma occurs at a younger age than the sporadic disease. In addition, the children with inherited retinoblastoma often developed the tumor in both eyes, suggesting an underlying predisposition & he suggested that multiple \"hits\" to DNA were necessary to cause cancer.* Retinoblastoma develops when both the normal alleles of the RB genes are inactive or altered. In Hereditary retinoblastoma first genetic change (first hit) in RB gene is inherited from an affected parent, where as second mutation (second hit) occurs in postnatal life and both alleles are lost. In non- hereditary retinoblastoma, both mutations (first and second hits) occur postnataly.",

        "exp": "Ans. D. None of the above. (Ref. Robbin's 8th/pg. 1159).Robbins pathology 8th/ pg. 1159.......\"Both capsular and vascular invasion may be encountered in benign lesions, and the presence of mitotic figures per se does not imply malignancy. Therefore, the definitive diagnosis of malignancy in pheochromocytomas is based exclusively on the presence of metastases. These may involve regional lymph nodes as well as more distant sites, including liver, lung, and bone.\"PHEOCHROMOCYTOMAPheochromocytomas are neoplasms composed of chromaffin cells, which, like their non-neoplastic counterparts, synthesize and release catecholamines and, in some cases, other peptide hormones. These tumors are of special importance because, although uncommon, they (like aldosterone-secreting adenomas) give rise to a surgically correctable form of hypertension.Pheochromocytomas = \"rule of 10s\":# 10% = familial .# 10% = extra-adrenal, occurring most commonly at the organ of Zuckerkandl.# 10% = bilateral.# 10% = malignant: Frank malignancy is somewhat more common in tumors arising in extra-adrenal sites.Histopathology:# Microscopically, pheochromocytomas are composed of polygonal to spindle-shaped chromaffin cells and their sup- porting cells, compartmentalized into small nests, or \"Zellballen,\" by a rich vascular network.6# Electron microscopy reveals variable numbers of membrane-bound, electron-dense granules, representing catechola- mines and sometimes other peptides. The nuclei of the neoplastic cells are often quite pleomorphic.# Both capsular and vascular invasion may be encountered in benign lesions, and the presence of mitotic figures per se does not imply malignancy.# Therefore, the definitive diagnosis of malignancy in pheochromocytomas is based exclusively on the presence of metastases. These may involve regional lymph nodes as well as more distant sites, including liver, lung, and bone.Clinical features:# The dominant clinical manifestation of pheochromocytoma is episodic hypertension. 6# Classically, this is described as an abrupt, precipitous elevation in blood pressure, associated with tachycardia, palpitations, headache, sweating, tremor, and a sense of apprehension. Such episodes may also be associated with pain in the abdomen or chest, nausea, and vomiting.# In practice, isolated, paroxysmal episodes of hypertension occur in fewer than half of individuals with pheochro- mocytoma.# Sudden cardiac death may occur.Biochemical Tests:# Unclear which is the best test, although most patients will have clearly abnormal values.# 24h urine metanephrines, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and free catecholamines: Most feel this is the first best test, as the values are usually elevated. Urine metanephrines: >1.2mg/d. Can see falsely elevated levels if patient is on labetolol or buspirone (metabolite of buspirone mistakenly read as metanephrine).6# Plasma catecholamines: Must be drawn under strict guidelines including patient fasting, supine for 30 minutes, and needle inserted at least 20 minutes prior to blood draw. Norepinephrine >2000pg/ml or epinephrine >200pg/ml is 95% specific and 85% sensitive. Metanephrine and normetanephrine plasma measurement are probably the most sensitive because these metabolites released directly from adrenals (>90% and 24-40%, respectively).# Clonidine suppression test: indicated if urine and plasma studies non-diagnostic and history still suggestive. Biopsy: contraindicated. 6Radiologic tests:# CT scan: 87% sensitive because it may miss tumors < 1cm which means in MEN-2 can miss up to 25%.# MRI: 98-100% sensitive, bonus ability to differentiate an adrenal pheo from other adrenal masses by T2 weighted images showing hyperintensity of pheos.6# I131-MIBG scan: scan detect tumors missed by CT or MRI and is excellent for evaluation of metastasis. Patients should not be on phenoxybenzamine prior to scan.6# DOPA-PET scan: can detect tumors in unusual locations most sensitively and specifically. 6# Adrenal Vein sampling; only needed when work up is inconclusive .Rx:# Surgical removal is Rx of choice and are now being successfully removed laparoscopically.# Pre-operative Rx: Treat hypertension and volume contraction.# Hypertensive Rx:- Alpha blockade with phenoxybenzamine, a long acting alpha pre and post-synaptic adrenergic antagonist. 10mg BID and increase to 0.5mg/kg daily in divided doses as needed to control HTN for 2-3weeks prior to surgery. Hold the morning of surgery.Prazosin may be used but requires more frequent dosing. Phenoxybenzamine can be used as definitive therapy for inoperable and malignant tumours.- Beta blockade can be added to treat tachycardia after adequate alpha blockade has been started. Labetolol best with its alpha 1 and beta-adrenergic antagonist activity.- Metyrosine (alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine) inhibits catecholamine synthesis.- Calcium channel blockers may be used if beta-blocker not tolerated.# Highest risk periods are during anesthesia induction and when tumor is manipulated. Nitroprusside should be available. Post-operatively hypotension and shock may occur. Hypoglycemia may develop in 10-15% secondary to release of suppression of insulin by excess catecholamines. Catecholamine secretion should return to normal in about one week.Prognosis:# Can be cured with surgery, although recurrence rate 14% in one series, with half of those being malignant. Risk of recurrence highest in familial disorders. Pain from metastatic bone lesions can be relieved with radiation therapy +/- chemotherapy.
