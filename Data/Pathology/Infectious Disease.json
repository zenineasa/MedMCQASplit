The patient has a history of recurrent pulmonary disease and respiratory distress. What microorganism recovered from the lungs of this child is virtually diagnostic of cystic fibrosis?",
        "exp": "Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in the white population. The disease is characterized by (1) chronic pulmonary disease, (2) deficient exocrine pancreatic function, and (3) other complications of inspissated mucus in a number of organs, including the small intestine, the liver, and the reproductive tract. It results from abnormal electrolyte transport caused by impaired function of the chloride channel of epithelial cells. The pulmonary symptoms of CF begin with cough, which eventually becomes productive of large amounts of tenacious and purulent sputum. Episodes of infectious bronchitis and bronchopneumonia become progressively more frequent, and eventually shortness of breath develops. Respiratory failure and the cardiac complications of pulmonary hypertension (cor pulmonale) are late sequelae. The most common organisms that infect the respiratory tract in CF are Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas species. As the disease advances, Pseudomonas may be the only organism cultured from the lung. In fact, the recovery of Pseudomonas sp., particularly the mucoid variety, from the lungs of a child with chronic pulmonary disease is virtually diagnostic of CF.Diagnosis: Cystic fibrosis",

Primary tuberculosis consists of lesions in the lower lobes and subpleural space, referred to as the Ghon focus. The infection then drains to hilar lymph nodes. The combination of Ghon focus and hilar lymphadenopathy is known as \"Ghon complex.\" The typical lesion of tuberculosis is a caseous granuloma, with a soft core surrounded by epithelioid macrophages, Langhans giant cells, lymphocytes, and peripheral fibrosis.

(Ref Robbin, Pathology, 7th ed., 137)PATHOGENESIS OF RABIES# The first event in rabies is the inoculation of virus through the skin, usually through a bite that delivers virus-laden saliva.# Initial viral replication appears to occur within striated muscle cells at the site of inoculation.# The peripheral nervous system is exposed at the neuromuscular and/or neurotendinous spindles of unmyelinated sensory nerve cell endings, with neurotransmitter receptors such as acetylcholine implicated in viral attachment and internalization.# The virus then spreads centripetally up the nerve to the CNS, probably via peripheral nerve axoplasm, at a rate of 3 mm/ h.# Once the virus reaches the CNS, it replicates almost exclusively within the gray matter and then passes centrifugally alone autonomic nerves to other tissues--- The salivary glands,Adrenal medulla,Kidneys,Lungs,- Liver,Skeletal muscles,Skin, andHeart.# The incubation period of rabies is exceedingly variable, from 7 days to 1 year (mean, 1 to 2 months)/# Rates of infection and mortality are highest from bites on the face, intermediate from bites on the hands and arms, and lowest from bites on the legs.# The neuropathology of rabies resembles that of other viral diseases of the CNS:- Hyperemia,- Varying degrees of chromatolysis,- Nuclear pyknosis, and- Neuronophagia of the nerve cells;- Infiltration by lymphocytes and plasma cells of the Virchow-Robin space;- Microglial infiltration; and- Parenchymal areas of nerve cell destruction.# The most characteristic pathologic finding of rabies is the eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions called Negri bodies within neurons. Each measures 10 nm and is made up of fibrillar matrix and virus particles.# Negri bodies are distributed throughout the brain, particularly in:- Ammon's horn,- Brainstem,- Hypothalamus, and- Purkinje cells of the cerebellumCerebellar,cerebral cortex,Dorsal spinal ganglia.# Negri bodies are not demonstrated in at least 20% of cases of rabies, and their absence from brain material does not rule out the diagnosis.RFFIT is valuable test to diagnose rabies.",

It arises from the glomus bodies, therefore named Glomus tumor. It is well recognised that glomus tumors arise from paraganglions, which are normally occurring structures usually found in close association with sympathetic ganglions along the aorta and its main branches. The chiefcells (paraganglionic cells (PGI90)) of the paraganglions are of neural crest origin and are components of the diffuse neuroendocrine system (DIVES). These paraganglionic cells are derived from embryonic neuroepithelium (neural crest). Glomus tumors are also referred to as chemodectomas or nonchromaffin (PGI04) paragangliomas. There are two types of glomus tumorsGlomus jugulareThese glomus tumors arise from the dome of the internal jugular vein in the hypotympanum (DPG10) and jugular foramen. In jugular foramen they can invade IX to XII cranial nerves.Glomus tympanicumThey arise from the promontory of the middle ear along the course of the tympanic branch of the IXth cranial nerve,o The glomus tumor is a rare and benign vascular neoplasm that arises from the neuroarterial structure called a glomus body. The normal glomus body is located in the dermis throughout the body, but is more concentrated in the digits. They are believed to function in thermal regulation,o The most common site of glomus tumors is subungual and 75% of the lesions occur in the hand,o The lesions present most frequently during the fourth and fifth decade of life although they can be found in any age and at any site.o The subungual tumors affect women three times more commonly then men.o The lesions are usually solitav but mulifocal tumors are also seen.o Clinically, glomus tumors are characterized by a triad ofsensitivity to cold,Localized tenderness andserve intermittent pain.The pain can be excruciating and is described as a burning or bursting.o Grossly, the tumors are usually less than one cm. in size, and appear as small red-blue nodules. The lesion appears as a localized dark red or blue lesion beneath the finger nail, but the subungual lesions can be difficult to detect on clinical examination.o Two usefull tests for diagnosing glomus tumors, particularly solitary painful glomus tumors (especially those under a nail) are the following :disappearance of pain after application of a tourniquet proximal ly on the arm.eliciting pain by applying pressure to a precise area with the tip of a pencil.# Treatment of glomus tumors consists of surgical excision.",

Investigators determined that the infection is acquired through cercariae that penetrate the skin. The cercariae are released from snails living in the irrigation canals. Infected individuals develop progressive ascites. Which of the following pathologic findings is most likely to be present in these infected individuals as a consequence of the infection?",
        "exp": "These farmers are infected with either Schistosoma mansoni or Schistosoma japonicum. Female worms reside in the portal venous system and release eggs that cut their way into the liver and incite a granulomatous inflammatory reaction. With time, the portal granulomas undergo fibrosis, compressing the portal veins. This gives rise to severe portal hypertension, splenomegaly, and ascites. A dilated cardiomyopathy may occur with Chagas disease, in which the Trypanosoma cruzi organisms are transmitted through the reduviid (triatomid) bug. Elephantiasis is a complication of filariasis, which is transmitted via mosquitoes. Mucocutaneous ulcers may be seen in Leishmania braziliensis infection, which is transmitted via sand flies.
