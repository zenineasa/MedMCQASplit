        "question": "All are true regarding kaposi sarcoma except one :",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' ie Occurs in AIDS pt. only There are at least 4 distinct epidemiological forms of Kaposi's sarcoma, only one form is associated with AIDS.The 4 distinct forms are -The classic form - that occurs in older men of predominantly Mediterranean or Eastern European, Jewish backgrounds.Equatorial African form - that occurs in all ages.The form associated with organ transplantationThe form associated with HIV-I infection.Kaposi 's sarcoma (K.S.)Kaposi's sarcoma is a multicentric neoplasm consisting of multiple vascular nodules appearing in the skin, mucous memb and lymph nodes, lung, GIT etc.Lesions often appear in sun-exposed areas, particularly the tip of the nose, and have a propensity to occur in areas of trauma (Koebner phenomenon)Course ranges from indolent with only minor skin or lymph node involvement to fulminant with extensive cutaneous and visceral involvement.AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma occurs predominantly in homosexual men (96%)K.S. does not result from a neoplastic transformation of cells in the classic sense and so is not truly a sarcoma. It is a manifestation of excessive proliferation of spindle cells that are believed to be of vascular origin, it is more a consequence of disordered cytokine regulation of cell growth than a true cancer. Generally speaking the tumor respects tissue planes and is rarely invasive. Disseminated K.S. is believed to be d/t occurrence of multiple neoplasm all over the body rather than to metastasis.Though K.S. is an opportunistic ds in HIV-infected individuals but unlike opportunistic infection, its occurrence is not strictly related to the level of depression of CD4+T cells counts. It may be seen at any stage of HIV inf. even in the presence of normal CD4+T cell count.Human Herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) is universally present in all forms of KS (in all the 4 types)In contrast to most malignancies, in which lymph node involvement implies metastatic spread and a poor prognosis, lymph node involvement may be seen very early in K.S. and is of no clinical significance.Management of KS associated with HIVIn the majority of cases, effective ARV therapy is quite helpful in achieving control. Spontaneous regressions have been reported in the setting of HAART.For patients in whom tumor persists or in whom control of HIV replication is not possible options exist.Treatment is indicated under two main circumstances.For a single lesion or a limited number of lesions causing significant discomfort or cosmetic problemslocalized radiation,intralesional vinblastine, orcryotherapyFor large number of lesions or visceral involvementSystemic therapies, either IFN- or chemotherapy is consideredInterferon- IFN provides an added advantage of having ARV activity; thus, it may be the appropriate first choice for single-agent systemic therapy for early patients with disseminated disease.Chemotherapy- Three of the chemotherapeutic agent that have been approved by the FDA for KS are:liposomal daunorubicin,liposomal doxorubicin, andpaclitaxelLiposomal daunorubicin is approved as first-line therapy for patients with advanced KS.The single most important determinant of response appears to be the CD4+ T cell count.Management of AIDS Associated Kaposi's SarcomaAntiretroviral therapySingle or limited number of lesionsLocalized radiationIntralesional vinblastineCryotherapyExtensive diseaseInitial therapyInterferon- (if CD4+ T cells >150/L)Liposomal daunorubicinSubsequent therapyLiposomal doxorubicinPaclitaxelCombination chemotherapy with low-dose doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine (ABV)Radiation treatment So the option (C) is not totally correct but option (D) is absolutely wrong.",

Today following genetic counselling, APC gene testing may be used to screen family members providing an APC mutation has been identified in a family member.\"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a dominantly inherited colon cancer syndrome due to germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 5.Patients with this syndrome develop hundreds to thousands of adenomas in the colon which if left untreated will eventually develop into colon cancer.Each of the FAP adenomas has lost the normal remaining allele of APC gene but has not yet accumulated the required additional mutations to generate fully malignant cells. In due course of time many of these adenomas acquire further genetic abnormalities and develop into fully malignant cancers. APC gene is thus considered to be a gatekeeper for colon tumorigenesis.The detection of APC gene mutation in family members of a FAP patient helps in making a definitive diagnosis before the development of polyps.So APC gene testing is used to screen family members",

Thus it is also known as Gleason sum.o If the entire specimen has only one pattern present, then both the primary and sencondary grades are reported as the same grade.o As Gleason grades range from 1 to 5, Gleason score thus range from 2 to 10. o The Gleason score is used to help evaluate the prognosis of men with prostate cancer. Together with other parameters, the Gleason score is incorporated into a strategy of prostate cancer staging which predicts prognosis and helps guide therapy.o A point of importance is that the primary Gleason grade is most important with respect to placing patients in prognostic groups. For example in patients with a Gleason score 7, a Gleason 4+3 is a more aggressive cancer than a Gleason 3+4.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Wide excision o Desmoid tumors, also known as \"aggressive fibromatosis,\" are soft tissue lesions that behave similarly to other truncal soft tissue sarcomas but have unique characteristics. These tumors, like other soft tissue sarcomas, present as slow-growing, indolent masses (sometimes can be aggressive). Unlike typical sarcomas however, these tumors rarely metastasize.o Desmoids are diffusely infiltrative and tend to recur locally, even after complete resection.o Most desmoid tumors arise sporadically, but a small percentage (~5%) occurs in association with FAP syndromeo Desmoids are classified as either abdominal or extra-abdominal. Abdominal desmoids are categorized further as superficial or intra-abdominal tumors . The superficial disease, also known as Dupuytren's fibromatosis, is slow growing, is small in size, and rarely involves deeper structures.Most of the intra-abdominal lesions are seen in association with FAP. These lesions are associated with mutations in the APC gene that are found in patients who have FAP. These tumors usually are found in the mesentery, and their growth and compression of neighboring structures can lead to significant morbidity and sometimes even death in these patientso Sporadic abdominal wall desmoid tumors have been found to be associated with pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use has also been associated with the occurrence of these tumors. These associations, combined with the detection of estrogen receptors within the tumor, suggest a regulatory role for estrogen in this disease. Tissue injury, such as trauma and/or surgery, also has been implicated in tumor developmento The natural history of desmoid lesions is unpredictable. Although most are indolent and slow growing, some lesions are aggressive. There are some reports of spontaneous regression, but such occurrences are mainly in women and are associated with chemical or surgical menopause. Most lesions are indolent and have benign- appearing histology, but local growth and compression have caused significant morbidity. Involvement of abdominal vessels and organs often complicates management.o Patients with desmoid tumors present with a painless enlarging mass. Local symptoms may arise from compression of adjacent organs or neurovascular structureso MRI is done to define the extent of disease and its relationship with other structureso Incisional biopsy or a core needle biopsy is done to confirm the diagnosis.Management:# Surgery with wide negative margins is the best treatment. Unfortunately, even with complete resection, the local recurrence rate is as high as 40%. Surgery is also the tit of choice for recurrences.# For tumors where vital visceral organs and local infiltration often make achieving negative margins difficult, other therapeutic modalities have been suggested.o Antiproliferative agents and cytotoxic chemotherapy have been used to palliate these tumors with variable results. The two most widely used groups of noncytotoxic drugs are NSAIDs (such as sulindac and indomethacin) and antiestrogens (such as tamoxifen).o Chemotherapy has generally been reserved for unresectable, symptomatic, and clinically aggressive disease. Partial responses have been observed after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin C, dacarbazine, or carboplatin, although toxicity has been relatively high.o Radiotherapy-\"The role of radiation therapy in the management of these tumors, either as an adjunct to surgery or as primary treatment, continues to be defined.\" - Sabiston",

This should be only rarely indicated in soft tissue sarcoma because limb-sparing operations are possible in at least 90% of patients.Amputation should be reserved for tumors not able to be resected by any other means, without evidence of metastatic disease and the potential for good long-term functional rehabilitation.",
