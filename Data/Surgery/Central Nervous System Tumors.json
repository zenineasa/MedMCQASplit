This is followed in patients < 60 years with radiotherapy.The mainstay of definitive therapy is chemotherapy.A single dose of rituximab is generally administered prior to cytotoxic chemotherapyChemotherapy includes high-dose methotrexate, but multi agent chemotherapy, usually adding vincristine and procarbazine, appears to be more effective than methotrexate alone.Chemotherapy is followed in patients <60 years with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT).Despite aggressive therapy >90% of patients develop recurrent CNS disease.",

Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (Ref: Osborn 3/e p 583-571, 562, 432: Wolfgang 7/e p 334)Most probable diagnosis in a child with raised ICT, lesion around foramen of Monroe and multiple periventricular calcific foci on CT scan is subependymal giant cell astrocytoma.\"Foramen of Monro (FM) is a Y-shaped structure that connects the two lateral ventricles with the third ventricle. FM masses are uncommon in young children. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SGCA) occurs in older children and young adults with tuberous sclerosis. Pilocytic astrocytoma also occurs in this age group. Subependymoma and central neurocytoma occurs in adults.

Decision to take the patient for surgery depends on CT findings.MRI BrainIt is used in elective situation for diagnosis of brain tumors.MRI is very helpful in identifying tumors in the posterior fossa (including acoustic neuromas), hemorrhagic lesions.MRI is also investigation of choice for diagnosing Brain Metastasis.PET-ImagingMetabolic imaging tool that is able to distinguish between benign and malignant tumours.18 FDG-PET and HMPAO-SPECT are used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and fibrosis at the site of operation. This has to be done in an elective situation.Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a nuclear medicine tomographic imaging technique using gamma rays.The gamma-emitting tracer used in functional brain imaging is99mTc-HMPAO (hexamethylpropylene amine oxime).Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is used in PET scan.
