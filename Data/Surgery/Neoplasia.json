Superficial : 9-11%;- Cystic: 4-8%; Pigmented: 6%; Morpheic : 2%.# Treatment:- Surgical excision -- the treatment of choice with cure rates between 85 and 95%.- Electrodessication and curettage -- commonly used for small superficial lesions (2--5 mm in diameter) gives cure rates between 85 and 100%.- Radiotherapy -- BCC is very radiosensitive and has an overall response of 92 % in selected patients. This is reserved for elderly patients who are not suitable for surgery or for specialised anatomical sites.- Moh's micrographic surgery (chemosurgery) --involving serial horizontal excision and mapping of the tumour. Usually reserved for recurrent lesions, tumours in difficult areas or those with indistinct borders (morphea-form).- Following complete excision it is unnecessary routinely to follow-up these patients unless they have a familial disposition for BCC formation (Gorlin's syndrome).",

During this initial stage the tumor cells seem to lack the capacity to metastasize.* Tumors in radial growth phase fall into several clinicopathologic classes, including:1) Lentigo maligna, usually presenting as an indolent lesion on the face of older men that may remain in the radial growth phase for several decades;2) Superficial spreading, the most common type of melanoma, usually involving sun-exposed skin; and3) Acral entiginous, these are mucosal lesions of melanoma and are unrelated to sun exposure.* After a variable (and unpredictable) period of time, melanoma shifts from the radial phase to a vertical growth phase, during which the tumor cells invade downward into the deeper dermal layers as an expansile mass. The vertical growth phase is often heralded by the appearance of a nodule and correlates with the emergence of a tumor subclone with metastatic potential.* Unlike melanocytic nevi, \"neurotization\" is absent from the deep invasive portion of melanoma.* The probability of metastasis in such lesions correlates with the depth of invasion, which by convention is the distance from the superficial epidermal granular cell layer to the deepest intradermal tumor cells; this measurement is known as the Breslow thickness.",

GRAWITZ'S TUMOR)# This is an adenocarcinoma.# It is the most common neoplasm (75 per cent) of the kidney.# It arises from renal tubular cells.# most commonly the upper pole.# Spread : The tumor is prone to grow into the renal vein.# Highly vascular metastases may pulsate.# If the tumour extends beyond the renal capsule it is liable to metastasise via the lymph nodes in the hilum of the kidney to the para-aortic nodes and beyond.# CF: M:F = 2:1.# Hematuria is the most common symptom.# In men, a rapidly developing varicocele is a rare but impressive sign, occurring most often on the left side because the left gonadal vein is obstructed where it joins the left renal vein.# Atypical C/f: Hyperpyrexia, Extreme anemia, or Polycythemia (occurs in 4%of cases), Hypercalcemia, Nephrotic synd.# Investigation: US is generally initial or screening too of choice, while CECT demonstrate the extent of the lesion more clearly and will show whether there is hilar lymphadenopathy or renal vein involvement. MRV remains the best choice for detecting renal vein invasion.# Treatment- If the tumor is confined to the kidney, treatment is nephrectomy with removal of the perinephric fat.- Nephrectomy can be performed through a loin or a transverse or oblique upper abdominal incision. The transab- dominal approach has the advantage that the renal pedicle and the IVC can be widely exposed.- The vascular pedicle should be ligated before the kidney is mobilised because handling the tumor may cause malignant cells to be released into the circulation.- Adenocarcinoma of the kidney does not respond well to radiotherapy or conventional chemotherapy. There have been early promising results from clinical trials of the cytokine interleukin-2 in this condition.- Conventional surgical treatment is by nephroureterectomy.- Percutaneous resection of these cancers is controversial.Also know:WILMS' TUMOR (Syn. NEPHROBLASTOMA)# This is a mixed tumor containing epithelial and connective tissue elements arising from embryonic nephrogenic tissue.# The tumors are usually discovered during the first 4 years of life.# Abdominal tumor. An abdominal tumor appears which grows rapidly while the general well being of the child deteriorates.# Pyrexia, which is a feature in half of these patients, disappears when the tumor is removed.# Initial Imaging is by ultrasonography,however CECT is best for evaluation.# Metastasis occurs early, mainly to the lungs. Liver and bone metastases are rare; and brain metastases even more so.# Lymphatic spread is uncommon.# The presence of bone secondaries favours a diagnosis of nephroblastoma, another renal tumor of childhood.# Rx: Nephrectomy should be performed as soon as possible and followed by radiotherapy with or without chemo- therapy.- Partial nephrectomy may be possible in patients with bilateral disease.# Prognosis- Under 1 year of age 80 per cent survive for 5 years, but the prognosis is less good in older children.- Recurrences usually occur within a year, so a child surviving for 18 months or more is probably cured.- NATIONAL WILMS' TUMOR STUDY GROUP (NWTS) STAGING SYSTEM (post-chemotheraphy based staging system in Wilms tumor).

        "question": "Which of the following conditions shows susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma in skin?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., All the above Squamous Cell Carcinoma:* Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common tumor arising on sunexposed sites in older people, exceeded only by basal cell carcinoma.* Except for lesions on the lower legs, these tumors have a higher incidence in men than in women.* Invasive squamous cell carcinomas are usually discovered while they are small and resectable.* Less than 5% of these tumors metastasize to regional nodes; these lesions are generally deeply invasive and involve the subcutis.* The most important cause of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is DNA damage induced by exposure to UV light.* Tumor incidence is proportional to the degree of lifetime sun exposure.* A second common association is with immunosuppression, most notably chronic immunosuppression as a result of chemotherapy or organ transplantation.* Immunosuppression may contribute to carcinogenesis by reducing host surveillance and increasing the susceptibility of keratinocytes to infection and transformation by oncogenic viruses, particularly human papilloma virus (HPV) subtypes 5 and 8. These same HP Vs have been implicated in tumors arising in patients with a rare autosomal recessive condition, epidermodysplasia verruciformis, which is marked by a high susceptibility to cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas.* In addition to its damaging effect on DNA, sunlight, through uncertain mechanisms, seems to cause a transient defect in cutaneous innate immunity that may diminish immunemediated elimination of sun-damaged cells.* Other risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma include industrial carcinogens (tars and oils), chronic ulcers and draining osteomyelitis, old burn scars, ingestion of arsenicals, ionizing radiation, and (in the oral cavity) tobacco and betel nut chewing.* Most studies on the genetics of squamous cell carcinoma have focused on acquired defects in sporadic tumors and their precursors (actinic keratoses), and the relationships between these defects and sun-exposure.* The patients patients with xeroderma pigmentosum show remarkable susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma.* As with all other forms of cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma stems from multiple driver mutations.* In addition to defects in p53, mutations that increase RAS signaling and decrease Notch signaling are common and are also likely to contribute to the transformation process.",
