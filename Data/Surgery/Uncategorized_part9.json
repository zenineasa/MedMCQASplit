        "question": "Rx of choice in postoperative lung collapse is -",
        "exp": "\"The most common postoperative respiratory complication is atelectasis. As a result of the anaesthetic, abdominal incision, and postoperative narcotics, the alveoli in the periphery collapse and a pulmonary shunt may occur. If appropriate attention is not directed to the aggressive pulmonary toilet with the initial symptoms, the alveoli remain collapsed and a buildup of secretions occurs and becomes secondarily infected with bacteria. The risk appears to be particularly high in patients who are heavy smokers, are obese, and have copious pulmonary secretions.\nPneumonia may develop early (i.e., 2-5 days after admission to the hospital) or late (i.e., >5 days) and is referred to as health care\u2014related pneumonia. Aspiration of oropharyngeal and gastric contents is the leading cause of health care\u2014related pneumonia.\nPresentation and Management\nThe most common cause of a postoperative fever in the first 48 hours after the procedure is atelectasis. The patients have a low-grade fever, malaise, and diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields. Very often the patient is uncomfortable from the fever but has no other overt pulmonary symptoms. Atelectasis is so common postoperatively that a formal workup is not usually required. However, if not aggressively managed, frank development of pneumonia is likely. A patient with pneumonia, on the other hand, will have a high fever, occasionally mental confusion, and the production of a thick secretion with coughing, leukocytosis, and a chest radiograph that reveals infiltrates. If the condition is not expeditiously diagnosed and treated, the patient may rapidly progress to respiratory failure and require intubation.\nPrevention of atelectasis and pneumonia is associated with pain control, which allows the patient to take deep breaths and cough. A patient-controlled analgesia device seems to be associated with better pulmonary toilet, as does the use of an epidural infusion catheter, particularly in patients with epigastric incisions. Respiratory care, otherwise, begins preoperatively. The patient must be instructed in the use of the incentive spirometer and be held accountable by nurses and physicians during rounds.\nEncouraging the patient to cough while applying counter pressure with a pillow on the abdominal incision site is most helpful. Rarely, other modalities such as intermittent positive pressure breathing and chest physiotherapy may be required. Encouraging the patient to breathe deeply and cough is the single most valuable management approach in preventing and resolving atelectasis and pneumonia.\nPatients in whom pneumonia develops in the postoperative period are managed with aggressive pulmonary toilet, induced sputum for culture and sensitivity testing, and empirical broad-spectrum IV antibiotic therapy while awaiting culture results. Once the organisms are cultured from sputum, a specific antibiotic must be used as indicated.\"",

        "exp": "* The uncomplicated acid-base disorders, which may be of metabolic or respiratory origin, are classified as being metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, or respiratory alkalosis.The pH (normal 7.38 to 7.44) determines whether the primary process is an acidemia (pH < 7.38) or an alkalemia (PH > 7.44). (Note that compensation for an alkalosis is always acidosis, while compensation for acidosis is always alkalosis, but in either case, compensation does not bring the pH into the normal range.) * Bicarbonate levels in metabolic acidosis are <21 mM, while those in metabolic alkalosis are >28 mM. Similarly, with respiratory disorders, examine the Pac02 (normal PC02 is 35 to 40 mmHg aerial, 40 to 45 mmHg venous). in patient with respiratory alkalosis the Pac02 is <35, while with respiratory acidosis the Pac02 is >40. * Patients with metabolic alkalosis lose acid, and this causes an increase in the blood pH the body compensates for - this increased pH by decreasing the respiratory rate, which increases blood CO2 levels (hypercapnia) and increases the renal excretion of bicarbonate. Causes of metabolic alkalosis include vomiting (losing gastric acid), increased aldosterone secretion (which causes increased excretion by the kidneys), and ceain diuretics. * In contrast, metabolic acidosis increases serum acid (increased hydrogen ion concentration), which decreases serum pH and decreases serum bicarbonate concentration. The causes of metabolic acidosis are broken down clinically into two groups: those with a normal anion gap and those with an increased anion gap. (The serum anion gap is found by taking the serum sodium concentration and subtracting the concentration of two anions, namely chloride and bicarbonate. * Normally, the anion gap is between 10 and 16 meq/L.) Increased anion gaps result from increased unmeasured anions, such as may occur in the following clinical situations: ketoacidosis (increased beta- hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid, seen with diabetic ketoacidosis); lactic acidosis (hypoxic conditions); chronic renal failure (uremia); and ingestion of ceain substances such as salicylates, ethylene glycol, methanol, and formaldehyde. * A normal anion gap metabolic acidosis may result from either loss of bicarbonate (diarrhea) or loss of renal regeneration of bicarbonate, seen with renal tubular acidosis type 1 (decreased excretion of titratable acid, i.e., NH and renal tubular acidosis type 4. * In a patient with metabolic acidosis, the body tries to combat the decreased pH by increasing the respiratory rate (tachypnea), which helps to raise the pH by blowing off CO2 and decreasing the serum CO2 (hypocapnia). The body also compensates through renal mechanisms that increase H excretion and increase bicarbonate reabsorption.",

The disease may begin as a minor flu-like illness that rapidly escalates into a fulminant infection. It is most common in the first two years after splenectomy but may occur decades later. Splenectomy may be followed by severe systemic infection because such surgery removes the splenic macrophages that filter and phagocytose bacteria and other bloodborne pathogens. Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) is uncommon but has high moality. Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection is usually caused by the encapsulated bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis and more than half of those infected die. Other pathogens in such infection may include bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Capnocytophagia canimorsus, group B streptococci, Enterococcus spp, Ehrlichia spp, and protozoa such as the Plasmodium spp. leading to malaria.",

        "exp": "The description of this case is classic for retinoblastoma, the most common malignant eye tumor of childhood. Retinoblastoma presents as in the question, and microscopically is composed of neuroepithelial cells that form characteristic rosettes (Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes). Familial retinoblastoma is often bilateral or multifocal, as in this case. A pre existing mutation of a tumor suppressor gene, Rb, located on chromosome 13 (13q14) is present, but causes no symptoms. A second, somatic mutation in a retinal cell leads to loss of a nuclear protein that prevents the retinal cell from exiting G1, allowing development of the tumor. In cases of sporadic retinoblastoma, mutations must occur in both chromosomes 13 of a somatic cell, a rare event, hence sporadic retinoblastoma is always unifocal and unilateral.

Campbell's urology states \"Best time for surgery for hypospadias is between 6-12 months of age.\" Hypospadias: This is a condition in which the external meatus of the urethra is situated at some point on the undersurface of the penis or perineum. Besides the abnormal position of external urethral meatus the other associated abnormalities are a) In the penile variety the urethra and corpus spongiosum distal to the ectopic opening are absent, Instead a fibrous cord is present. Due to contracture of this fibrous cord, the penis is curved ventrally (in a downward direction) this is known as chordee. So the more proximal the ectopic opening is placed the greater is the chance of chordee. This curved penis causes problem in intercourse as well as micturition. b) In all cases, inferior aspect of the prepuce is poorly developed. While the superior aspect is normally developed. This causes prepuce to take the form of hood and is called hooded prepuce. Complications of hypospadias ? a) Difficulty in directing the urinary stream. b) Due to presence of chordee, erection is difficult and painful and the intercourse may be difficult or impossible. c) Infeility can occur (usually associated with posterior type), T/T of Hypospadias: T/T of hypospadias is very complex. Here are some impoant points. Treatment is not required in anterior variety. In this variety the patient is usually functional both for micturition and procreation and repair is done primarily for cosmetic reasons. In case of other varieties, a plastic operation is performed to bring the external urethral meatus to its normal position, and remove the chordee to straighten the curvature. Operation can be done in one stage or two stage surgeries. Now days one stage surgeries are more popular. - Indication for 2 stage operation - Scrotal or perineal variety - Even sever proximal types have been treated in single stage repair with success. - Circumcision is not done in patients with hypospadias as the prepuce can later be used in surgical repair.",

        "exp": "The plasma membranes of intestinal epithelial cells contain a sodium gradient that drives the active transpo of glucose. The rate and amount of glucose transpoed depend upon the sodium gradient maintained across the plasma membrane. Sodium ions entering the cell in the company of glucose are pumped out again by Na+,K+-ATPase. Once in the cytosol of the intestinal cell, the glucose moves across the cell and diffuses out of the cell into the interstitial fluid of the submucosa and then into the plasma of the capillaries underlying the intestinal epithelium. This occurs for the following reason: while glucose is maintained in blood plasma at an approximately constant level, it is always slowly moving out of the plasma into the cells of tissue that use it. Given that the diffusion from the intestinal cells into the plasma is passive, the intestinal cells and the plasma try to maintain an equilibrium. Thus, plasma glucose levels are always approximately equal to or slightly less than levels in the intestinal cells. Due to the passive maintenance of this equilibrium, it is highly unlikely that the concentration of glucose in the plasma can get much higher than that in the intestinal cell cytosol. It is also unlikely that the levels of glucose in other tissues of the body (for example, muscle) will have any bearing on those found in the intestinal cells",

D: Mediastinal shift A flail chest occurs when multiple adjacent ribs are broken in multiple places,i.e. three or more ribs fractured in two or more places, separating a segment, so a pa of the chest wall moves independently. Flail chest is invariably accompanied by pulmonary contusion, that can interfere with blood oxygenation. Often, it is the contusion, not the flail segment, that is the main cause of respiratory failure. The characteristic paradoxical motion of the flail segment occurs due to pressure changes associated with respiration that the rib cage normally resists: During normal inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and intercostal muscles push the rib cage out. Pressure in the thorax decreases below atmospheric pressure, and air rushes in through the trachea. However, a flail segment will not resist the decreased pressure and will appear to push in while the rest of the rib cage expands. During normal expiration, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, allowing the abdominal organs to push air upwards and out of the thorax. However, a flail segment will also be pushed out while the rest of the rib cage contracts. The constant motion of the ribs in the flail segment at the site of the fracture is incredibly painful, and, untreated, the sharp broken edges of the ribs are likely to eventually puncture the pleural sac and lung, possibly causing a pneumothorax.",

In both, mesenchymal connective tissue is replaced by bone but by different mechanics. Endochondral ossification This type of ossification involves the replacement of a cailaginous model by bone. Bone formation takes place in pre-existing cailage. Mesenchymal tissue first forms cailage which is latter ossified to become bone. Most of the longs bones develop by endochondral ossification. Other bones are veebrae, pelvis, skull base bones. Interstitial growth of long bone at epiphyseal cailage occurs by endochondral ossification. Intramembranous ossification Mesenchymal cells give rise to osteogenic cells which develop into osteoblasts. steoblasts begin to lay down osteoid which latter mineralised to form bone Thus, there is direct formation of bone from mesenchymal tissue (with no cailage formation as occurs in Endochondral ossification). This type of ossification transforms membrane into bone. The bone formation occurs at the periphery with layers of bone being laid down analogous to the ring-like diameter of a tree. This type of growth is called appositional growth. Skull vault, maxilla, most of the mandible and clavicle are formed by intramembranous ossification.",

        "exp": "In most patients (85-90%) with acute pancreatitis, the disease is self-limited and subsides spontaneously, usually within three to seven days after treatment is instituted. Conventional measures includes *Analgesics for pain *IV fluids and colloids to maintain normal intravascular volume *No oral alimentation. Once it is clear that a patient will not be able to tolerate oral feeding (a determination that can usually be made within 48-72 hours), enteral nutrition should be considered since it maintains gut barrier integrity, thereby preventing bacterial translocation, is less expensive, and has fewer complications than TPN. The route through which enteral feeding is administered is under debate. Nasogastric access is easier to establish and may be as safe as nasojejunal enteral nutrition. However, enteral nutrition that bypasses the stomach and duodenum stimulates pancreatic secretions less and this rationale theoretically suppos the use of the nasojejunal route. It has not been demonstrated whether either route is superior in altering morbidity and moality. When patients with necrotizing pancreatitis begin oral intake of food, consideration should also be given to the addition of pancreatic enzyme supplementation and proton pump inhibitor therapy to assist with fat digestion and reduce gastric acid. About oral antibiotics harrisson states that: \"There is currently no role for prophylactic antibiotics in either interstitial or necrotizing pancreatitis. Although several early studies suggested a role for prophylactic antibiotics in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis, two recent double-blind, randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate a reduction in pancreatic infection with use of antibiotic prophylaxis\". Percutaneous aspiration of necrosis with Gram stain and culture should generally not be performed until at least 7-10 days after establishing a diagnosis of necrotizing pancreatitis and only if there are ongoing signs of possible pancreatic infection such as sustained leukocytosis, fever, or organ failure. Once a diagnosis of infected necrosis is established, appropriate antibiotics should be instituted and surgical debridement should be undeaken",

There is relative absence of inflammatory cells Surgical Pathology & Cytopathology writes - \"There may be crypt architectural distoion and branching similar to that evident in idiopathic irritable bowel syndrome (IBD), but without the dense lamina propria inflammation.\" Solitary Rectal Ulcer Syndrome The pathogenesis of mucosa/ prolapse syndrome or solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is unclear. It has been postulated that there is a dysfunction of the neuromuscular control of defecation. This necessitates an increase in intraabdominal pressure to achieve expulsion of the stool. The pressure then forces a rectal mucosal fold to prolapse into the anal canal. Localized ischemia of the prolapsed mucosa as a result of local vascular compromise then produces the characteristic histological change of SRUS. SRUS affects both sexes, over a wide range, but is most common in women 20-40 years of age. Most lesions occur on the anterior or anterolateral rectal wall, but SRUS may involve the bowel anywhere from the sigmoid to the anorectal junction. Despite the designation solitary rectal ulcer, in 10 to 15% of cases multiple ulcers may be present within a single patch of diseased mucosa. Endoscopically only about half of the patients with SRUS have an actual ulcer. The remaining patients have an area of mucosal erythema, mucosal nodules, or frank polyps, which may or may not have surface ulceration. The histological features can be correlated to the underlying pathogenesis of the disorder. Prolapsed mucosa becomes ischemic due to compression of the vascular supply, paicularly the small veins. This leads to detachment of the surface epithelium and withering of the superficial poion of the crypts, similar to ischemia from any cause. Since the prolapse is typically intermittent, during intervals of normal blood flow regrowth of the mucosa is stimulated, resulting in mucosa' hyperplasia due to elongation of the crypts. As an additional response to the ischemic injury, fibrosis of the lamina propria occurs. There may be crypt architectural distoion and branching similar to that evident in idiopathic irritable bowel syndrome, but without the dense lamina propria inflammation. The muscularis mucosa also becomes thickened and disorganized and tongues of muscle extend upwards from the muscularis mucosa to the surface epithelium. In some cases the ischemia is severe enough to lead to erosion or ulceration, often with a scanty overlying pseudomembrane. The cells show enlarged, hyperchronzatic nuclei, excess mitotic activity, and mucin-depleted goblet cells",

Investigation used are Mammography - can show any underlying suspicious lesion Cytological examination - this may identify malignant cells, but a negative finding does not rule out cancer. Galoctography/Ductography The primary indication for ductography is nipple discharge, paicularly when bloody. Ductography though helpful in reaching a diagnosis is not essential, since excision of bloody duct system is indicated regardless of finding. In this study, a contrast medium is injected into the discharging duct and a mammogram taken. The injected may show a intraductal papilloma as a filling defect surrounded by contrast. Cancers may appear as irregular masses or as multiple intraluminal filling defects, or abrupt obstruction. Duct ectasia or fibrocystic disease may appear as dilated cystic structures Ultrasound - may show presence of an underlying mass or duct ectasia. The final diagnosis is made by excising the involved duct (Microdochotomy) and any underlying mass if present and subjecting them for a histopathological diagnosis.

When the IAP exceeds 15 cm F120, serious physiological changes begin to occur. The lungs are compressed by the upward displacement of the diaphragm. This causes a decrease in functional residual capacity, increased airway pressure, and ultimately hypoxia. a) - Cardiac output decreases due to diminished venous return to the hea and increased afterload. - Both venous return and aerial perfusion of every intraabdominal organ especially kidneys are severely compromised. This leads to oliguria which may progress to anuria. As IAP exceeds 25 to 30 cm of H2O life threatening hypoxia and anuric renal failure occurs. Physiological Consequences of Increased Infra-abdominal Pressure Decreased Increased Cardiac Output Cardiac rate Central Venous Return Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure Visceral blood flow Peak inspiratory pressure Renal blood flow Central venous pressure Glomerular filteration Intrapleural pressure Systemic vascular resistance Management The diagnosis is made by measuring bladder pressure (through Foley catheter). It represents the intraabdoinal pressure. Abdominal compament syndrome is a surgical emergency and treatment includes rapid decompression of the elevated intraabdominal pressure by opening the abdominal wound and performing a temporary closure of the abdominal wall with mesh or a plastic bag. Permanent closure is done 5 to 7 days later when the condition resolves. IAP pressures less than 15 mm of 1120 do not require decompression.",

Underlying pathology is neuromuscular incoordination in this region Zenker's diveiculum is a pulsion diveiculum Esophageal Diveicula are of two types: pulsion & traction - In pulsion diveiculum, increased intraluminal pressures (secondary to abnormal esophageal motility) push the mucosa and submucosa through a muscular defect in the wall of the esophagus creating a pulsion diveiculum. It's not true diveicula (not containing all the layers of the esophageal wall) In traction diveicula extraluminal forces (like inflammed & scarred peribronchial & mediastinal lymph nodes) pull the full thickness of the esophagus out, creating a true diveicula. Zenker's is the most common esophageal diveicula. The diveicula arises posteriorly in the midline of neck. The mouth of the diveicula is in the midline but the sac projects laterally (usually left laterally) Zenker's diveicula are rarely seen below 30 yrs of age, most patients are over 50. Dysphagia is the most common symptom. Undigested food is regurgitated into the mouth, especially when the patient is in the recumbent position. Swelling of the neck, gurgling noises after eating, halitosis (bad mouth odour) and a sour metallic taste in the mouth are common symptoms. Barium swallow is diagnostic Management (Maingot's 11/e chapter 8; Sabiston 18/e p1062; Schwaz 9/e p848) Surgical therapy is the treatment of choice. Methods used are: a) Cricopharyngeal myotomy - a myotomy alone is usually sufficient for small diveicula (<2cm). b) Myotomy with Diveiculopexy - larger diveiculum may be sutured in the inveed position to the preveebral fascia using a permanent suture (i.e., diveiculopexy). - diveiculopexy avoids the complication of infection due to leak from a resected diveiculum (diveiculectomy) c) Myotomy with excision of sac - done for large (> 5 cm) diveicula - If the diveiculum is excessively large so that it would be redundant if suspended a diveiculectomy should be performed. d) Diveiculo-esophagostomy using a linear cutting staple gun the septum between the esophagus and the diveicula is divided also known as Dohlman procedure advantage is that it takes less time to complete, does not require an incision, and therefore may have less morbidity. This is an impoant consideration since this disease most commonly presents in the elderly. - This procedure is effective for diveicula >2 cm, and may be impossible to perform for the small diveiculum. Sabiston writes- \" For these reasons, this technique has gained or and is advocated in patients with diveicula between 2 and 5 cm.\" Also know Cervical webs are seen associated in 50% of patients with Zenker's diveicula and can cause dysphagia postoperatively if not treated.",

        "question": "All of the following statements are true about repair of groin hernias except -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., In shouldice repair, non absorbable mesh is used Shouldice repair is a method of hernia repair in which the inguinal floor is strengthened by just approximation of tissue using non-absorbable sutures. No mesh is used. Management of Groin hernias (mainly inguinal hernia) There are 2 objectives of t/t : 1) Treatment of the hernial sac In Indirect hernias, the sac is dissected free from the cord structures and cremastric fibres. The sac is opened and the herniated contents are reduced. Then the sac is ligated at the internal inguinal ring. Alternatively the hernial sac may be invaginated back into the abdomen without ligation. Direct sacs are usually too broad based for ligation and should not be opened but instead are simply inveed into the peritoneal cavity. 2) Inguinal floor reconstruction -Management of the hernial sac is sufficient for children and young adults, but some method of reconstruction (repair or strengthening) of the inguinal floor is necessary in all adult hernias to prevent recurrance. 3 broad categories of repair are available a) Primary tissue repair b) Anterior tension free mesh repairs c) Preperitoneal repairs - open & the laparoscopic approach a) Primary tissue repair In this method the post wall of inguinal canal is strengthened by just approximation of tissues with sutures. There is no use of any prosthetic material. Primary repairs without mesh were the mainstay of hernia surgery for decades. The advantages are simplicity of the repair and absence of any foreign body in the groin. Disadvantages include higher recurrence rates due to tension on the repair and a slower return to unrestricted physical activity. Consequently, tension free mesh repairs have now become the dominant method of inguinal hernia repair. Commonly performed primary tissue repairs are i) Bassini repair ii) Halsted repair iii) McVay (Cooper ligament) repair iv) Shouldice repair v) Darn repair - Darn repair gets its name from the way a long nylon suture repeatedly passed between the tissues to create a weave that one might consider similar to mesh. b) Anterior tension-free mesh repair - Recognizing that tension in a repair is the principal cause of recurrence, current practices in hernia management employ a synthetic mesh prosthesis to bridge the defect Recurrence rate is quite low with these techniques - Common employed techniques are i) Lichtenstein repair - In Lichtenstein repair a piece of polypropylene mesh is used to reconstruct the inguinal floor. - The mesh is sutured to the abdominal fascia. - Recurrence rate is quite low ii) Patch and plug technique - In this method a plug of mesh is inseed into the hernial defect (i.e. internal ring in Indirect hernia) and sutured in place. Then another piece of mesh is placed over the inguinal floor which may or may not be sutured to the fascia. c) Laparoscopic and Preperitoneal repairs The laparoscopic hernia repair is based on the technique of 'Stoppa', who used an open preperitoneal approach to reduce the hernia and placed a large piece of mesh to cover the entire inguinal floor and myopectineal orifice. Preperitoneal hernia repairs may also be performed without mesh, but its rarely used now. In Laparoscopic hernia repair, the preperitoneal space is reached by either transabdominal laparoscopy (TAPP) or by a totally extraperitoneal repair (TEP) Both techniques are similar in actual repair but differ in the manner by which the preperitoneal space is accessed. i) TAPP (Trans-abdominal pre-peritoneal) - in the TAPP repair, the peritoneal space is entered by conventional laparoscopy and then the preperitoneum overlying the inguinal floor is dissected away as a flap. ii) TEP (totally extraperitoneal repair) - in TEP repair the preperitoneal space is accessed without entering the peritoneal cavity. Choice of Anesthesia Here there is difference of opinion b/w Schwaz Surgery (8/e, p 1368) & Washington Manual of Surgery (4/e, p 511) According to Washington Manual of Surgery - local anesthesia is the preferred anesthetic for elective open repair. - Laparoscopic hernia repair have been carried out under local or regional anesthesia, but is more commonly done under General anesthesia. According to Schwaz Surgery - General anesthesia is the preferred choice for open as well as laparoscopic repair.",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Valgus Stress Test Tests to Detect Ligament Injury Lachman Test - The Lachman test is the best test to diagnose an ACL tear. - With the patient lying flat and relaxed, the examiner bend the knee slightly, about 20 degrees. The examiner then stabilizes the thigh while pulling the shin forward. - Both the amount of translation (shifting) as well as the feel of the endpoint offer information about the ACL. Anterior Drawer Test - The anterior drawer test is also performed with the patient lying flat. The knee is bent 90 degrees and the shin is pulled forward to check the stability of the ACL. - An intact ACL will only allow the shin to come forward slightly. - A torn ACL will allow the shin to move fuher forward. Pivot Shift Test - The pivot shift test is a difficult maneuver to perform on a patient who is not under anesthesia. This test places a stress on the knee joint that forces a subluxation (paial dislocation) in patients who do not have an ACL. - This test recreates the type of instability that caused the ACL injury. Posterior Drawer Test - The posterior drawer is performed similarly to the anterior drawer test. - This test detects injury to the PCL. - By pushing the shin backward, the integrity of the PCL is tested. - Excessive movement of the shin backwards is a sign of PCL injury. Varus and Valgus Instability - Varus and valgus instability tests check the LCL (lateral collateral ligament) and MCL (medial collateral ligament), respectively. - With the patient lying flat, and the knee held at about 30 degrees of flexion, gentle adduction and abduction force is applied. - Insufficiency of the LCL or MCL will allow the knee to \"open up\" excessively. - The test is repeated with the leg straight. If the knee still opens up excessively, then more than just the LCL or MCL was torn.",

With the advent of CT scanning, nonoperative management of solid organ injuries has replaced routine operative exploration. Those patients who do require operation may be treated with less radical resection techniques such as splenorrhaphy or paial nephrectomy. Colonic injuries, previously mandating colostomy, are now repaired primarily in viually all cases. Additionally, the type of anastomosis has shifted from a double-layer closure to a continuous running single-layer closure; this method is technically equivalent to and faster than the interrupted multilayer techniques. Adoption of damage control surgical techniques in physiologically deranged patients has resulted in limited initial operative time, with definitive injury repair delayed until after resuscitation in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) with physiologic restoration. Abdominal drains, once considered mandatory for parenchymal injuries and some anastomoses, have disappeared; fluid collections are managed by percutaneous techniques.\"",

The values generated by the test can then be compared to both: Young adult population : called a \"T score\", this test measures the variance between the patient and the young adult baseline. A score above -1 is considered normal; a score between -1 and -2.5 is considered osteopenia; and a score below -2.5 is considered osteoporosis. For each -1 standard detion in T score there is a 3 times increased risk of hip fracture and a 2.5 times risk of spine fracture. Age-and gender-matched control groups : a \"Z score\" measures the variance between the patient's and control groups' amount of bone.

The pulse strikes the palpating finger with a rapid, forcefid jerk and quickly disappears. It is best felt in the radial aery with the patients arm elevated. It is seen in Aoic regurgitation. Pathophysiology of water hammer pulse In Aoic regurgitation the stroke volume is high, so the systolic pressure is high and this is responsible for sharp rise in the pulse. The stroke volume is high because the left ventricle gets blood from two sources during the diastole i.e. blood leaking from the Aoa and the blood it receives from left atria. The collapse occurs because Diastolic leak of blood into the left ventricle from the Aoa Rapid run off to the periphery as a result of low systemic vascular resistance (the increased cardiac output stimulates the baroreceptors in the aoic arch and the result is reflex vasodilatation of the peripheral vessels into which the blood flows rapidly). Wiry are arms elevated in the examination ? When the arm is raised there is fall of blood column resulting in vasodilation and thus helps to reduce the diastolic pressure more, so the pulse pressure widens. It may be so that the aery palpated becomes more in the line of Aoa after elevation of the arm and thus allows the direct systolic ejection and diastolic backward flow.",

A: MRI Scan Avascular necrosis/ osteonecrosis/ aseptic (bone) necrosis/ ischemic bone necrosis is a disease resulting from the temporary or permanent loss of the blood supply to the bones. Without blood, the bone tissue dies and causes the bone to collapse. There are many causes of avascular necrosis such as: Alcoholism Excessive steroid use Post trauma Caisson disease (decompression sickness) Vascular compression Vasculitis Thrombosis Damage from radiation Bisphosphonates (paicularly the mandible) Sickle cell anaemia Gaucher's Disease Idiopathic (no cause is found). Rheumatoid ahritis and lupus are also common causes of AVN. Avascular necrosis most commonly affects the head of femur. Other common sites include the talus, scaphoid and the jaw. Avascular necrosis usually affects people between 30 and 50 years of age. When it occurs in children at the femoral head, it is known as Legg-Calve-Pehes syndrome. It is most oftenly diagnose clinically. Because early X-rays are usually normal in the early stage of the disease, bone scintigraphy and MRI are the diagnostic modality of choice since both can detect minimal changes at early stages of the disease.

Shock is an acute dramatic syndrome characterized by the inadequate\ncirculatory supply of oxygen so that the metabolic demands of vital organs and tissues are not met. Shock has been categorized into a series of the recognizable stage: -\nCompensated Uncompensated Irreversible An initial insult triggers shock, thus disrupting blood flow to end organs leading to inadequate tissue perfusion.\nThe body9s compensatory mechanism is initiated to maintain perfusion to vital organs. If treatment is not introduced during this period,\ndecompensated shock develops causing tissue damage that leads to multisystem organ dysfunction and death. Compensatory shock\n\nIn the early phases of shock, multiple compensatory physiologic mechanisms act to maintain blood pressure and preserve tissue perfusion.\n\nBlood pressure remains normal, initially, because of peripheral vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance.\nThus hypotension occurs late and is more a characteristic of the uncompensated stage of shock Patients in compensated shock have relatively normal cardiac output and normal blood\npressures but they have an alteration in microcirculation that increases flow to some organs and reduce flow to other.\nIn infants, compensatory increases in cardiac output are achieved primarily by \u201ctachycardia\u201d rather than by an increase in stroke volume.\nHeart rates of 190-210/min are common in infants with compensated shock.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Naloxone Pharmacologic Management of Post op paralytic ileus (P01): Minimizing the sympathetic inhibition of gastrointestinal motility, decreasing inflammation and stimulation of gastrointestinal 11-opioid receptors are the ultimate goals of pharmacologic management. A) Minimizing sympathetic inhibition Both propranolol, a nonspecific 13-receptor antagonist, and dihydroergotamine, an a-receptor antagonist, have been investigated for treatment of POI. Neostigmine is an acetylcholinsterase inhibitor that causes an increase in cholinergic (parasympathetic) activity in the gut wall, which is believed to thereby stimulate colonic motility. Use of edrophonium chloride and bethanechol chloride, which competitively inhibit acetylcholine on the binding site of acetylcholinesterase, has been repoed to show improvement of POI. Cisapride is a serotonin (5-HT)4 receptor antagonist that promotes acetylcholine release from postganglionic nerve endings in the myenteric plexus and is thought to indirectly improve gastrointestinal motility. Metocloprimide is suspected to enhance gastrointestinal motility without stimulating gastric secretion, but its use has not been substantiated for POI. B) Decreasing inflammation Decreasing inflammation may be indicated in patients who are about to undergo major intestinal surgery, as this is thought to be an impoant contributing factor to POI. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) agents can be used in conjunction with opioid analgesics for their dual effects on pain control and inflammatory inhibition. C) Stimulation of gastrointestinal iii-opioid receptors Stimulation of gastrointestinal .1-opioid receptors can theoretically influence gastrointestinal motility directly; therefore, blocking the peripheral gastrointestinal effects of centrally acting opioids used for analgesia may help prevent POI. Two novel drugs are being investigated for this reason: alvimopan and methylnaltrexone. Both drugs are If-opioid receptor antagonists, and both appear to offer promising results for preventing prolonged POI. Opioid therapy for postoperative or chronic pain is frequently associated with adverse effects, the most common being dose-limiting and debilitating bowel dysfunction, so alvimopan and methylnaltrexone may also be useful in the treatment of chronic opioid bowel dysfunction. The currently available opioid antagonists such as naloxone are of limited use because they also act at central opioid receptors to reverse analgesia and elicit opioid withdrawal. Alvimopan and methylnaltrexone are peripherally acting if-opioid receptor antagonists that have been studied in patients undergoing abdominal and pelvic surgery and have been shown in several studies to significantly accelerate gastrointestinal recovery. Alvimopan received FDA approval for the treatment of POI on May 20, 2008. D) Alternative medications Bisacodyl administration versus placebo twice daily staing on postoperative day 1, patients who received bisacodyl had significantly earlier bowel movements than those who received placebo (25 h v. 56 h), but fuher studies are needed to assess the effect of laxatives on POI.",

Abnormalities involving any of these normal metabolic pathways may lead to the accumulation of triglycerides within the hepatocytes. This accumulation of triglycerides is called fatty change or steatosis. Examples of abnormalities that produce hepatic steatosis include diseases that cause excess delivery of free fatty acids to the liver or diseases that cause impaired lipoprotein synthesis. Excess delivery of free fatty acids occurs in conditions that increase lipolysis of adipose tissue, such as starvation, diabetes mellitus, and coicosteroid use. Increased formation of triglycerides can result from alcohol use, as alcohol causes excess NADH formation (high NADH/NAD ratio), increases fatty acid synthesis, and decreases fatty acid oxidation. Impaired apoprotein synthesis occurs with carbon tetrachloride poisoning, phosphorous poisoning, and protein malnutrition. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity is the mechanism of lovastatin, which indirectly increases liver LDL receptors and increases LDL clearance from the blood.",

Prior to this, the standard definitive treatment for carcinoma of the anal canal was abdominal-perineal resection, which necessitated a permanent colostomy.

Surgery should also be recommended for patients with upper tract dilation, renal insufficiency secondary to BPH, or bladder stones.\"- Schwaz 8/e p1530About other options:Prostate Size: Treatment of BPH is primarily dictated by patient's symptoms and not by the prostate size. However the size of prostate can decide whether to go for endoscopic method of treatment or open surgical procedure. Open surgery is more effective than endoscopic methods for prostates weighing >100gm (ref: Schwaz 9/e p1471; Smith's Urology 17/e p354)UTI: Recurrent episodes of UTI (and not a single episode) are an absolute indication for surgery of prostate. Hypeension: Alpha blockers which are first line medical therapy for BPH lower the blood pressure and thus are helpful in hypeensive persons.Management of BPH Management is primarily directed by symptoms. Mild symptoms can be managed with watchful waiting. More severe symptomatic patients are treated with medicines (alpha blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors or combination of both). Surgery is recommended if the paient is having problems despite medical therapy. Absolute indications for surgery as listed in Smith's Urology is given below.Absolute indications for surgical treatment of BPH1) Refractory urine retention (failing at least one attempt at catheter removal)2) Recurrent UTI from BPH3) Bladder stones d/t BPH4) Renal insufficiency d/t BPH5) Large bladder diveicula secondary to BPH6) Recurrent gross hematuria from BPHUpper tract dilatation is an indication for surgery according to Schwaz.Medical therapyAlpha-blockers (terazosin, doxazosin, and tamsulosin)Alpha-blockers help is reducing the symptoms of BPH by blocking the alpha 1 adrenoreceptors present in human prostate and bladder base.5-Alpha-reductase inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride) ?5-alpha-reductase inhibitors block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. This thus results in reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptoms (after several months of use).SurgerySurgery for BPH is most commonly performed endoscopically; however, if the prostate gland is quite large (approx >100 g), an open prostatectomy should be performed.The standard endoscopic procedure for BPH is a transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate.Conventional surgical methods:Transurethral resection of the prostate (most commonly used method)Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP)Open simple prostatectomy (simple suprapubic prostatectomy, simple retropubic prostatectomy) ?- When the prostate is too large to be removed endoscopically, an open enucleation is necessary. What constitutes\"too large\" is subjective and varies depending upon the surgeon's experience with TURP. Glands >100 g areusually considered for open enucleation. Open prostatectomy may also be initiated when concomitant bladderdiveiculum or a bladder stone is present or if dorsal lithotomy positioning is not possible.- Open prostatectomies can be done with either a suprapubic or retropubic approach. A simple suprapubic prostatectomy is performed transvesically and is the operation of choice in dealing with concomitant bladder pathology.Minimally invasive methods:1. Laser therapy (Nd:YAG and holmium:YAG )Transurethral electrovaporization of the prostateMicrowave HypehermiaTransurethral needle ablation of the prostate?High-intensity focused ultrasound for thermal tissue ablationIntraurethral stents--stents are endoscopically placed in the prostatic fossa and are designed to keep the prostatic urethra patent.

Patients with fluid on FAST examination, considered a positive FAST', who do not have immediate indications. for laparotomy and are hemodynamically stable undergo CT scanning to quantify their injuries.\" Sabiston v,rites - Hemodynamically stable patients sustaining blunt trauma are adequately evaluated by abdominal ultrasound or CT. unless other severe injuries take priority and the patient needs to go to the operating room before the objective abdominal evaluation. In such instances, DPL or. focussed abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) is usually performed in the operating room to rule out intra-abdominal bleeding requiring immediate surgical exploration. The main decision in an abdominal injury is to decide whether an exploratory laparotomy is necessary or not. Physical examination though may help sometimes, has significant limitations and may be unreliable. The diagnostic approach to penetrating (Gunshot and Stab wounds) and blunt abdominal trauma differs substantially. Gunshot abdominal wounds: Chances of internal injury is very high in gunshot wounds thus little preoperative evaluation is required and laparotomy is mandatory. Stab wounds to abdomen: In contrast to GSWs, SWs are less likely to injure intra-abdominal organs. Patients with isolated penetrating abdominal wound if hypotensive, or in shock or showing peritoneal signs go for exploratory laparotomy. Management of stable patients is debatable and controversial. Various methods are used to determine whether laparotomy is necessary or not. Anterior stab wound- In ant. stab wounds local wound exploration can be performed to determine if there is any penetration of the peritoneal cavity. If the tract terminates without entering the peritoneum, the injury can be managed as a deep laceration and laparotomy is not needed. Otherwise, penetration of the peritoneum is assumed, and significant injury must be excluded by fuher diagnostic evaluations. Options include diagnostic peritoneal lavage, laparoscopy, CT, FAST, and admission with observation. Flank and back wounds- There is more debate over the management of stab wounds to the flank and back. These injuries are special because of the risks associated with retroperitoneal organ injury-colon, kidneys and ureter. Triple contrast CT (i.e. oral, IV, and rectal contrast) is advised to detect colon and retroperitoneal injuries and the need for laparotomy. Other methods like DPL, laparoscopy arc also advised. Blunt abdominal injury: Hemodynamically stable patients sustaining blunt trauma are adequately evaluated by abdominal ultrasound or CT (CT in selected cases to refine the diagnosis) unless other severe injuries take priority and the patient needs to go to the operating room before the objective abdominal evaluation. In such instances, DPL or focussed abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) is usually performed in the operating room to rule out infra-abdominal bleeding requiring immediate exploratory laparotomy. US has largely replaced DPL. Management of hemodynamically unstable pt: a hemodynamically unstable pt is evaluated by FAST and if infra-abdominal fluid detected, undergoes laparotomy.",

Chest x-ray demonstrates notching of his ribs. Which of the following undiagnosed congenital defects may be responsible for these findings?",
        "exp": "Coarctation of the aoa occurs in two patterns. In the infantile type, the stenosis is proximal to the inseion of the ductus aeriosus (preductal); this pattern is associated with Turner's syndrome. In the adult form, the stenosis is distal to the ductus aeriosus (postductal) and is associated with notching of the ribs (secondary to continued pressure from the aoa on them), hypeension in the upper extremities, and weak pulses in the lower extremities. Headache, cold extremities, and lower extremity claudication with exercise are typical if the patient is symptomatic (many adults with mild distal coarctation may remain asymptomatic for years). Upper extremity hypeension with weak pulses in the lower extremities, and a midsystolic (or continuous) murmur over the chest or back may be the only obvious signs in some. Note that the chronic cough is probably related to the man's smoking, and is not caused by the coarctation. Eisenmenger's syndrome is a shift from a left-to-right shunt to a right-to-left shunt secondary to pulmonary hypeension. Tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of great aeries cause cyanosis and are usually diagnosed in infancy. Ref: Karamlou T.B., Welke K.F., Ungerleider R.M. (2010). Chapter 20. Congenital Hea Disease.

It can be used for osteolytic spinal metastes, multiple myleoma, aggressive hemangiomas, osteoporotic veebral compression fractures. Its use has been recommended for patients with sho life expectancy or in salvage cases. It is contraindicated in infection eg TB, osteomyelitis, discitis etcQ. Veebroplasty & Kyphoplasty Veebroplasty is percutaneous placement of large spinal needles into the fractured / compressed veebral body through a channel made in the pedicle and injecting bone cement into th fractured bone. It requires high pressure injection b/o structure of the trabeculae and the high viscosity of the bone cement as it hardens. Veebroplasty was designed to decrease pain and strengthen the bone to prevent fuher collapse of a wedge compression fracture (that result from failure of anterior column by forward flexion forces). It does not restore veebral body height or prevent spinal deformity. Balloon Kyphoplasty is the next step in treatment of veebral compression fractures. This percutaneous minimally invasive procedure involves reduction & fixation performed through small instruments inseed into the veebral body through the pedicle. A small balloon is inflated to restore the height of collapsed veebral body and create a cavity inside. The balloon is deflated & withdrawn, and the remaining cavity is filled under low pressur with the surgeon's choice of material. This procedure restores veebral height & spinal alignment , which is impoant in preventing long term morbidity & moality that ariss from veebral compression fractures & spinal deformity (d/ t cardio-respiatory compromise) . It stabilities veebrae internally, facilitates pain relief and restores function rapidly. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement is controlled injected in paste like consistency with fluoroscopic monitoring. 5g of barium sulfate and 2g of tungeston powder is mixed with each kit of PMMA cement to make it radiopaque enough to be visualized adqquately. Potential complications include extrusion of cement into the spinal canal, resulting in neurological compromise, infection, hematoma, pulmonary embolus, failure to relieve pain, and incomplete deformity correction. Pulmonary embolism was correlated with paraveebral venous cement leak, but not with the number of veebral bodies treated or the type of procedure (vetebroplasty or kyphoplasty).

Muir-Torre syndrome Muir-Tone syndrome is an autosomal-dominant familial cancer syndrome. The hallmark of Muir-Tone syndrome is presence of numerous sebaceous gland neoplasms, including carcinomas that may precede, follow, or coexist with visceral cancers. Visceral cancers associated with MTS are - GI tract adenocarcinoma of the colon or genitourinary tract, or lymphoma. The defining feature of this syndrome is the combination of sebaceous gland tumours and at least one visceral cancer. Typical skin tumours associated with this syndrome include sebaceous adenomas, epitheliomas and carcinomas. Keratoacanthomas and basal cell carcinomas with sebaceous differentiation also occur. All these sebaceous gland tumours are rare in the general population; the finding of such a tumour is a marker for MTS. Early recognition of the syndrome in patients with sebaceous gland tumours should facilitate early detection of subsequent malignancies if the patient is entered into appropriate screening programmes. Colorectal cancer is the commonest visceral neoplasm to occur in MTS. Cutaneous neoplasms Visceral malignancies * Sebaceous adenomas * GIT malignancies most Muir Torre * sebaceous epitheliomas commonly colorectal ca syndrome * sebaceous carcinomas * Genitourinary ca * Keratocanthoma * Basal cell carcinoma Other options: Cowden's disease or multiple hamaoma syndrome is an autosomal-dominant syndrome with numerous tumors of the hair follicles called tricholemmomas located on the face. These patients have very high risk of breast and thyroid carcinomas. Bilateral mastectomies may be recommended. Mammography and other exposure of the breast tissue to 0 radiation is contraindicated. Multiple Hamaomatous polyps occur anywhere in the GI tract. Gardner's syndrome is a variant of FAP; familial adenomatous polyposis, a colorectal cancer syndrome characterized by hundreds of adenomatous colorectal polyps, with an inevitable progression to colorectal cancer by age 40. Cutaneous manifestations may be the presenting sign and include numerous epidermal cysts and soft tissue tumors. Osteomas of mandible and skull are the most common facial lesions in Gardner syndrome. Gardner syndrome is characterized by: - Colorectal polyposis - Epidermoid cysts - Desmoid tumors - Osteomas - Thyroid neoplasms, and - Congenital hyperophy of the retinal pigment epithelium Turcot's syndrome is also a variant of FAP characterized by: - Colorectal polyposis - Brain tumors (Medulloblastoma, Glioblastoma multiforme) Also Know: Gorlin-Goltz syndrome or Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is characterized by the presence of multiple basal cell carcinomas, numerous bony abnormalities, and a strong predisposition for malignancy.

It usually affects children and adolescents. It commonly involves diaphysis of long bones, paicularly in the proximal humerus. Patients usually presents with pain with nocturnal exacerbations. It is usually relieved with NSAIDS. On X ray it appears as dense coical sclerosis surrounding a radiolucent nidus. Ewing's sarcoma affects long bones such as femur, tibia or humerus in young and affects flat bones in young patients. In the long bones, tumor almost always affects the metaphysis or diaphysis. X ray shows onion peel appearance due to alternate layers of reactive new bone formation and the tumor tissue. Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant bone tumor, it affects metaphysis of long bones.

If the ulcer persists for more than 3 months despite eradication of H. pylori and maintenance antisecretory therapy or the ulcer is associated with perforation, bleeding, or obstruction, the operation is indicated.\nThe choice of operation for recurrent postoperative ulcer depends on the indication for initial operation & the operation performed previously. Since these ulcers have recurred despite prior peptic ulcer disease surgery and maximal medical therapy, surgery should be appropriately aggressive.\nTruncal vagotomy with antrectomy is the operation of choice. This is the procedure with the least recurrence rate.\n\nRecurrence after prior treatment by medications:\n\nIf at all surgery is needed an operation with least morbidity is advised i.e. Highly selective vagotomy.\n\nRecurrent gastric ulcer:\u00a0\n\nNon-healing gastric ulcers despite antibiotics and antisecretory drugs should be viewed with suspicion for malignancy (Duodenal ulcers have no risk of malignancy) and thus distal gastrectomy is the recommended operation. Other surgical options are wedge resection with HSV. (Note HSV is of no use in Type I and Type IV ulcers as these are associated with acid hyposecretion)",

Each segment has its own vascular inflow, outflow and biliary drainage. In the centre of each segment there is a branch of the poal vein, hepatic aery and bile duct. In the periphery of each segment there is vascular outflow through the hepatic veins. Right hepatic vein divides the right lobe into anterior and posterior segments. Middle hepatic vein divides the liver into right and left lobes (or right and left hemiliver). This plane runs from the inferior vena cava to the gallbladder fossa. Left hepatic vein divides the left lobe into a medial and lateral pa. Poal vein divides the liver into upper and lower segments. The left and right poal veins branch superiorly and inferiorly to project into the center of each segment. Because of this division into self-contained units, each segment can be resected without damaging those remaining. For the liver to remain ble, resections must proceed along the vessels that define the peripheries of these segments. This means, that resection-lines parallel the hepatic veins. The centrally located poal veins, bile ducts, and hepatic aeries are preserved",

But Osteomyelitis can also be put in d/d. Only point which goes against osteomyelitis is the location i.e. the mid-shaft of femur. Osteomyelitis is commonly seen at metaphysis, although diaphysis can be rarely involved. Grainger writes-\"The differential diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma includes osteomyelitis, other lyric bone lesions, osteosarcorna and metastases from another primary tumour. The routine imaging algorithm of these patients includes plain radiography and MRI of the primary lesion, bone scintigraphy of the skeleton looking for metastatic bone spread and plain radiography and CT for chest evaluation of metastases.\" \"When a large soft-tissue mass is present it can still be difficult to differentiate between tumour and infection, even with Gadolinium enhancement. The diagnosis is made by biopsy.\" In this case X ray has already been done. Next investigation should be MRI (or CT; MR is better). MRI is ideally suited for evaluating the soft tissues, the intramedullary extent of disease, and adjacent soft-tissue involvement of the primary lesion and is an essential pa of the evaluation of a patient with Ewing's sarcoma. Biopsy is done to confirm the diagnosis and rule out osteomyelitis and other bone tumors.Bone scintigraphy is done to look for bone metastases.CT chest is done to look for any lung metastasis. Ewing's sarcoma: Ewing's sarcoma of bone is a highly anaplastic, small, round cell tumor of neuroectodermal origin. It is an aggressive malignancy with a high local recurrence and metastatic rate. Ewing sarcoma is the second most common primary malignancy of bone (after osteosarcoma) in patients younger than 30 years of age and the most common in patients younger than 10 years of age. The most common locations include the metaphyses of long bones (often with extension into the diaphysis) and the flat bones of the shoulder and pelvic girdles. Ewing sarcoma is exceedingly rare in individuals of African descent. Clinical findings: Pain is an almost universal complaint of patients with Ewing sarcoma. Usually the onset is insidious, and the pain may be of long duration before the patient seeks medical attention, The pain may be only mild and intermittent initially and may respond to initial conservative treatment. In addition to pain, patients also may have fever, erythema, and swelling suggesting osteomyelitis. Diagnosis: Laboratory studies may reveal an increased white blood cell count, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and an elevated C-reactive protein. Ewing sarcoma appears radiographically as a central lytic tumor of the diaphyseal-metaphyseal bone. It creates extensive permeative destruction of coical bone, and as it breaks through under the periosteum, it takes on a typical onionskin, multilaminated appearance; however, this is not pathognomonic for Ewing's sarcoma. Radiating spicules of new bone in a sunburst pattern (sun-ray appearance) can also occur, making radiographic differentiation from osteosarcoma difficult. Saucer-shaped destruction of the exterior coex is a fairly characteristic feature. Regardless of the location, MRI of the entire bone should be ordered to evaluate the full extent of the lesion, which typically extends beyond the abnormality apparent on plain films. MRI also is useful to evaluate the extent of the soft-tissue mass, which often is very large. All patients should have a baseline radiograph and a CT scan of the chest because the lung is the most common site of metastases. A bone scan should be performed because bone is the second most common site of metastases. Histologically, Ewing sarcoma consists of small blue cells with very little intercellular matrix. Cytogenetic or immunohistochemical studies often are required to differentiate Ewing sarcoma from other small blue cell tumors. The t(11;22)(q24;q12) is the most common translocation diagnostic of Ewing sarcoma and is present in greater than 90% of cases. Immunohistochemical staining for the MIC2 gene product has been repoed to be specific for Ewing sarcoma. In addition, Ewing sarcomas usually are periodic acid-Schiff positive (owing to intracellular glycogen) and reticulin negative. This is in contrast to lymphomas, which are periodic acid-Schiff negative and reticulin positive. Treatment The prognosis is always poor and surgery alone does little to improve it. Radiotherapy has a dramatic effect on the tumor but overall survival is not much enhanced. Chemotherapy is much more effective. The best results are obtained by a combination of all three methods: a course of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy; then wide excision if the tumor is in a ourable site, or radiotherapy. .followed by local excision if it is less accessible,. and then a. fuher course of chemotherapy.for 1 year. Postoperative radiotherapy may be added if the resected specimen is found not to have a sufficiently wide margin of normal tissue.",
