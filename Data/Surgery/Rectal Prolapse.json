        "exp": "Ans. (a) Digital positioningRef: Bailey & Love 2&h ed. /1220* Patients who present with a prolapsed rectum should undergo manual reduction. Conservative management is appropriate in selected patients. Treatment should be directed to the underlying cause. After treating the underlying cause, conservative management is usually successful. Cases of difficult reduction and patients with recurrent episodes are less likely to respond to conservative measures.* The prolapsed bowel may be grasped with lubricated gloved fingers and pushed back in with gentle steady pressure. If the bowel has become edematous, firm steady pressure for several minutes may be necessary to reduce the swelling and allow for reduction. If the prolapse immediately recurs, it may be reduced again and the buttocks taped together for several hours.* However, if the prolapse persists after an adequate trial of medical therapy (usually a period of months), surgical intervention may be required. Pain, excoriations, and rectal bleeding are considered indications for surgical treatment.",
