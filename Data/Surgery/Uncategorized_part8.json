Other bacteria identified definitively as triggers of ReA include several Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Clinical Features The clinical manifestations of ReA constitute a spectrum that ranges from an isolated, transient monahritis to severe multisystem disease. The joints of the lower extremities, especially the knee, ankle, and subtalar, metatarsophalangeal, and toe interphalangeal joints, are the most common sites of involvement, Dactylitis, or \"sausage digit,\" a diffuse swelling of a solitary finger or toe, is a distinctive feature of ReA. Tendinitis and fasciitis are paicularly characteristic lesions Urogenital lesions: In males: urethritis may be marked or relatively asymptomatic. Prostatitis is also common. In Females: cervicitis or salpingitis Ocular: transient, asymptomatic conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis Mucocutaneous lesions: Oral ulcers, the characteristic skin lesions- keratoderma blenorrhagica, consist of vesicles that become hyperkeratotic, ultimately forming a crust before disappearing. They are most common on the palms and soles, Lesions on the glans penis, termed circinate balanitis, are common Management: Most patients with ReA benefit to some degree from NSAIDs, although acute symptoms are rarely completely ameliorated, and some patients fail to respond at all. Indomethacin, 75-150 mg/d in divided doses, is the initial treatment of choice, but other NSAIDs may be tried. Prompt, appropriate antibiotic treatment of acute chlamydial urethritis or enteric infection may prevent the emergence of ReA. However, several controlled trials have failed to demonstrate any benefit for antibiotic therapy that is initiated after onset of ahritis",

        "exp": "Acute fulminant liver failure for any cause Following arc the types of liver transplantation: Cadaver donor transplantation: The donor liver is obtained from a person who is diagnosed as brain dead whose family volunteers to donate the organ for transplantation. Living donor transplant: A healthy family member or a volunteer donates pa of his liver for transplantation. Ohotropic liver transplant: it involves the replacement of the patient's diseased liver with the donor's liver. Auxiliary liver transplant Auxiliary transplantation (A-OLTX): Here the patient's liver is not removed. Pa of the liver of a healthy adult donor (living or cadaver) is transplanted into the recipient, alongside pa of the patient's own liver. Auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation is theoretically attractive because it leaves the recipient's liver in place. The surgical trauma of hepatectomy is avoided, and failure of the graft does not necessarily lead to the death of the patient or a second, emergency transplantation. Another advantage is that matching the body sizes of the donor and the recipient is not mandatory, which increases the number of possible donors The following aicle-\"Auxiliary Paial Ohotopic Living Donor Liver Transplantation: Kyoto University Experience\" (at the .following website latp://www.inedscape.combiewaicle/500102) mentions four indications for auxiliary paial ohotopic liver transplantation: reversible fulminant hepatic failure non-cirrhotic metabolic liver disease snzall-for-size grafts for ABO-incompatibility Fultninant hepatic failure: Total ohotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) is a lifesaving therapeutic option for patients with FI-1F, but requires lifelong immunosuppression to maintain the graft. Auxiliary paial ohotopic liver transplantation whereby only a poion of the native liver is removed, and the remainder of the native liver is left in situ, provides temporary suppo until the native liver recovers and then immunosuppression can be withdrawn. The advantage claimed for APOLT in non-cirrhotic metabolic liver disease (most commonly Crigler-Najjar syndrome) is that it can compensate for enzyme deficiencies without complete removal of the native liver, which may have to aid the recipient in case of potential graft failure. The remaining native liver could benefit in the future from potential success in gene treatment Transplants of ABO-incompatible grafts are often unavoidable due to the limited number of potential donor candidates. A high incidence of early graft failure with a high rate of binary and vascular complications in ABOincompatible liver transplantation was repoed. The remnant native liver could sustain a patient's life if the anticipated graft failure occurred in an ABO-incompatible case. The rationale of APOLT for a small-for-size graft is that the remnant native liver is expected to suppo the function of the implanted graft during the early post-operative period. The graft liver expands its function in propoion to volume growth. After the graft liver has grown sufficiently, it can be expected to meet the hepatic functional demands of the recipient. The following aicle \"Auxiliary paial liver transplantation for end-stage chronic liver disease\" in The New England Journal of Medicine Volume 319:1507-1511December 8, 1988Nutnber 23 (at the following website gi/content/abstract/319/23/1507) mentions another indication for A-OLTX - End-stage chronic liver disease who are high-risk patients. These patients are not accepted for ohotopic liver transplantation because of massive ascites, deficient clotting function, cachexia, or poor pulmonary reserve. So we see that all the options except 'b' are indications for A-OLTX We have chosen acute liver ds. as the answer as it's the probably the most common indication as evident by maximum number of aicles on the net describing A-OLTX for acute liver failure. This book -\"Atlas of Upper Gastrointestinal and Hepato-Pancrato-Biliary surgery- publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg \" mentions only acute liver failure as an indication for A-OLTX.",

        "exp": "Bone hemangiomas are benign, malformed vascular lesion, overall constituting less than 1% of all primary bone neoplasm. They occur most frequently in the veebral column (30-50%) and skull (20%), whereas involvement of other sites (including the long bones, sho tubular bones, and ribs) is extremely rare. Peak incidence occur in the 50s. Hemangiomas are largely asymptomatic, and thus most are never discovered, leading some to describe these lesions as \"rare\". Veebral hemangiomas can cause neurological symptoms if they extend into the epidural space. Appearance on X-ray is depend on the location. The lesions are often poorly defined,appearing as a somewhat localized area of abundant, dilated vessels, some of which may on the surface of the bone, within the coex of the bone, or extend into the medullary cavity. However, the radiographic hallmark of bone hemangiomas is a prominent trabecular pattern. Despite the added diagnostic information available with CT scanning and MRI, the angiomatous nature of many extraspinal lesions can be confirmed only by histologic analysis. On gross examination, hemangiomas look like a disorganised collection of veins or vascular spaces. Grossly there are cystic, dark red cavities. The lytic areas are sharply defined and there is trabecular thickening. Under the microscope, there are four type of hemangiomas : capillary, cavernous, aeriovenous, and venous. Capillary and cavernous lesions are most common in bone. Treatment of hemangiomas is unnecessary unless the lesion is symptomatic. Hemangiomas: Most bonafide hemangiomas in bone are solitary lesions. Comprises less than 1.5 % of the total series. Female preponderance in a ratio of 3 : 2. Hemangiomas are usually found in adults. Many of the hemangiomas are asymptomatic. Hemangiomas that expands the bone and produce new bone may cause notable swelling. Local pain is sometimes a feature. There may be fracture, including compression fracture of veebra, Rarely, spinal cord compression may occur. Hemangiomas in veebrae characteristically cause polka-dot appearance on computed tomograms. Hemangiomas usually respond well to conservative procedures. Radiation may be required for lesions that ar in inaccessible sites. Massive hemangiomas, especially with involvement of soft tissues, may require amputation.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Non-union A. CoIle's fracture is usually produced by a FOOSH (fall on an outstretched handy mechanism with the wrist in dorsiflexion. The fracture is dorsally displaced and may be comminuted. The fracture pattern is often described as a silver or dinner-fork deformity. Two classification systems are used: The Association for Osteosynthesis (AO) system The Frykman system. Complications of the Colles fracture include: Post-traumatic stiffness Mal-union Subluxation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint Acute carpal tunnel syndrome Sudeck's osteodystrophy. Rupture of the extensor pollicis longus tendon B. An impact to the dorsum of the hand or a hyperflexion or hypersupination injury results in Smith's fracture. A Smith fracture is usually called a reverse Colles fracture because the distal fragment is displaced volarly. It is often described as a garden-spade deformity. C. Baon fractures are classified as dorsal or palmar (always intra-aicular), and they always involve carpal subluxation. The volar Baon fracture is thought to occur with the same mechanism as the Smith fracture, with more force and loading on the wrist. The dorsal Baon fracture is caused by a fall on an extended and pronated wrist, increasing carpal compression force on the dorsal rim. The salient feature is a subluxation of the wrist. By definition, this fracture has some degree of carpal displacement, which distinguishes it from a Colles or Smith fracture. The palmar variety is more common than the dorsal type. D. The chauffeur's fracture derives its name from injuries that were acquired, in the days when motor vehicles were cranked, when a vehicle backfired. The force is described as a direct axial compression of the scaphoid into the radial facet. The radial styloid is fractured, with associated avulsion of the radial collateral ligament. A chauffeur's fracture represents an avulsion related to the attachment sites of the radiocarpal ligaments or of the radial collateral ligament. E. Galeazzi fracture results from a FOOSH mechanism with the forearm hyperpronated or from a direct impact to the dorsal radial wrist. The radial diaphysis at the distal and middle third junction is fractured, with associated subluxation of the distal radioulnar joint. On PA views, the radius is shoened and the radioulnar joint is disrupted. On the lateral view, the distal radius is angulated either volarly or radially as a result of the pull of the brachioradialis muscle with more than 3 mm of ulnar displacement. F. The Essex-Lopresti fracture consists of a comminuted and displaced radial head fracture along with disruption of the distal radioulnar joint and interosseous membrane.",

Once again make it clear \"FEV, expressed as percentage (FEV,%) is actually FEV ,/ FVC.\" If the individual being tested displays a low FEV, and the FEV,% is also low, then the clinician should suspect the presence of obstructive pathologies. In patients with restrictive lung diseases - FVC low - FEV, is also low, (hut there is less reduction in comparison to FVC). Since both of these values may be equally affected in restrictive lung disease the %FEV, is normal or sometimes it is increased because the decrease in FEV, is less compared to decrease in FVC. Hence when % FEV, is between 85% - 100% of the normal and if both FEV, and PVC are low then you should suspect the patient of having restrictive lung disease. Major clues given in the question are :? Decreased DLCO --> (Normal predicted range is 75-120%) Normal FEV1IFVC --> (Normal predicted range is 88% - 90%) Normal FVC (FVC > 80% is considered normal) Beside these patient is having decrease in oxygen saturation on exercise. These abnormalities suggest primary pulmonary hypeension. Interstitial lung disease can be ruled out because of nonnal ITC (FVC is reduced in restrictive lung disease).

Possible cells of origin include the epidermal MC, a dermal MC equivalent, a neural-crest- derived cell of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) system, and a residual epidermal stem cell. oCytogenetic abnormalities are present in 30-47% of MCCs. The most frequent change is loss of heterozygosity due to translocations or deletions of chromosome 1; specifically, 2 distinct regions in the most distal band 1 p36 on the sho arm of chromosome 1are implicated in MCC. Similar abnormalities near this site occur in several neuro cystic tumors, including melanoma, neuroblastoma, and pheochromocytoma. Other abnormalities described in MCC include losses at chromosomes 3, 13, and 22 and paial trisomy 01 chromosomes 1, 11, 18, and X. Unlike neuroendocrine (small cell) carcinoma of the lung, gene amplifications are rare in cutaneous MCC. oCytokeratin 20 is expressed in a dot like paranuclear or crescentic pattern; other low molecular weight (MW) cytokeratin antibodies (E.g., CAM5.2, MNF116), white less specific, react in a similar localization pattern. oElectron microscopic findings are char9- cteristic, revealing a lobulated nucleus that may contain rodlets. The cytoplasm is electron- lucent and contains a prominent Golgi apparatus and numerous ribosomes. Intermediate filaments are numerous and often assume a parallel or whorled arrangement near the nucleus, accounting for the dot like pattern of cytokeratin distribution visualized by immunohistochemistry.

The hernia is bilateral in 12% of cases. In boys, differentiating between a hernia and a hydrocele is not always easy. Transillumination has been advocated as a means of distinguishing between the presence of a sac filled with fluid in the scrotum (hydrocele) and the presence of bowel in the scrotal sac. However, in cases of inguinal hernia incarceration, transillumination may not be beneficial because any viscera that is distended and fluid-filled in the scrotum of a young infant may also transilluminate. A rectal examination may be helpful if intestine can be felt descending through the internal ring. * Silk sign: When the hernia sac is palpated over the cord structures, the sensation may be similar to that of rubbing 2 layers of silk together. This finding is known as the silk sign and is highly suggestive of an inguinal hernia. The silk sign is paicularly impoant in young children and infants, in whom palpation of the external inguinal ring and inguinal canal is difficult because the patients' small size. Operation is the treatment of choice. The basic operation is inguinal herniotomy, which entails dissecting out and opening the hernia sac, reducing any contents and then transfixing the neck of the sac and removing the remainder.",

The type of temporal bone fracture the patient has?",
        "exp": "Longitudinal Middle cranial Fossa is involved in 60%-80% of fracture of skull base. Types of Temporal bone fracture include Longitudinal, Transverse. Mixed, Oblique and Unusual. a. Longitudinal : * The longitudinal is one where fracture line runs parallel to the Petrous ridge, that is longitudinal axis of the bone. it constitutes 85% of all the Temporal Bone . 23% are bilateral. Fracture begins in Squamous Temporal Bone & continues towards the Petrous apex, coursing around the dense Otic capsule bone. Hearing loss is common after the injury; it is usually mixed hearing loss. * These invariably results in laceration of the roof of the External Auditory Canal and often the tympanic membrane blood from the middle ear appears in the of External Auditory Canal, leading to a-dictum, that bloody Otorhea after head injury usually represents a longitudinal temporal bone until proved otherwise. If the Dura is disrupte CSF may leak through a disrupted Tegmen Tympani, resulting in CSF Otorrhea. * Spontaneous Nystagmus is Rare. * Facial N. is usually spared * Most extends along the Fallopian Canal rather than across it. Facial weakness after this is usually incomplete and is most often delayed, secondary. to the edema rather than disruption of the nerve. b. Transverse : * This runs right angle to the longitudinal axis of the Petrous bone. * Caused by: - Blow on the Occipul or less commonly a direct frontal blow. Transverse has a higher moality than longitudinal and greater force is required to generate them. * The \"Classical' Transverse begins in Posterior Cranial Fossa, usually in the region of Foramen Lacerum or Foramen Spinosum. * The hearing loss in transverse is usually Sensorineural, caused by disruption of the integrity of the labrynth or the neurovascular bundle in the internal auditory canal. Veigo with spontaneous Nystagmus & post traumatic common after it.Facial n. paresis is also common (50%), it is immediate and greater intensity than longitudinal . Mixed : Involves a combination of several of the routes, described. Oblique : a recent study (not confirmed) shows that these types of are actually the most common (75%).

D: Hernia occurring at the level of arcuate line Spigelian hernia is an acquired ventral hernia through the linea semilunaris, the line where the sheaths of the lateral abdominal muscles fuse to form the lateral rectus sheath, at the level of arcuate line. Spigelian hernias are nearly always found above the level of the inferior epigastric vessels. Commonly, the patient is over the age of 50 years. Men and women are equally affected. The patient presents with pain that is localised to the hernial site and is aggravated by any movement that raises intraabdominal pressure. Later, the pain becomes more dull, constant, and diffuse. A soft, reducible mass may be present in the lower abdominal area which disappears on pressure. When the mass is reduced, the hernial orifice can usually be palpated. Diagnosis is more difficult when the hernia dissects within the layers of the abdominal wall - internal and external obliques - or may be located at a distance from the linea semilunaris. Ultrasound and CT scan may help to confirm the diagnosis.",

Chest X rays are taken to assess the presence and extent of pleural cavity collection (blood or simple plural fluid) - a supine position with horizontal x-ray beam (k/a decubitus position) is better than an erect film, as about 400-500 ml of blood may be hidden by diaphragm on upright chest x-ray. Management of hemothorax Most of the hemothorax can be t/t effectively with a large bore chest tube drainage and in most of the cases the bleeding stops as the lungs re-expands. A small number of cases will require thoracotomy - continued bleeding - a significant blood clot has formed. Currently, most hemothoraces requiring more than simple tube drainage can be managed with Videothoracoscopy. Thoracotomy may be needed only if more extensive exposure is needed to manage an active source of bleeding or if extensive decoication of the lung is necessary. About the option 'a' i.e. seen on choriocarcinoma - I am not sure. Well, Choriocarcinoma is quite a malignant tumor with propensity for vascular invasion and also metastasizes most commonly to the lung. I would personally go for the option, as tumors are a known cause of hemothorax.",

The bursa develops within the first years of life as a result of mechanical pressure and friction, and it serves the purpose of reducing friction on underlying structures and allowing maximal range of motion in the knee.

Normally are equal in size, round and briskly reactive to light. Brain injury and pressure on the nerves leading to pupils can produce change in pupil size, shape and reacting to light and movement. These changes can be correlated with the severity and type of brain injury. A sudden enlargement (Dilation) of one pupil (anisocoria) is an ominous sighn that require immediate intervention. This typically signals increased pressure on one side of the brain, causing the brain to shift downwards in the skull cavity (uncal or tonsillar herniation). \"While decoicate posturing is still an ominous sign of severe brain damage, decerebrate posturing is usually indicative of more severe damage as the rubrospinal tract and hence, the red nucleus, is also involved indicating lesion lower in the brainstem\". Signs of brain injury: Loss of the normal autoregulation of blood pressure and pulse, called the cushing's reflex is a hallmark of severe brain injury or imminent crisis. This generally results in a sudden rise in blood pressure and a slowing of the pulse. A person with a moderate or severe TBI may have a headache that does not go away, repeated vomiting or nausea, convulsions, an inability to awaken, dilation of one or more pupils, slurred speech, aphasia (word- finding difficulties), dysahria (muscle weakness that causes disordered speech), weakness or numbness in the limbs, loss of coordination, confusion,restlessness, or agitation. When the pressure within the skull (intracranial pressure, abbreted ICP) rises too high, it can be deadly. Sign of Increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness on one side of the body, and a blown pupil, one that fail to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing's triad, a slow hea rate with high blood pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. Anisocoria, unequal pupil size is another sign of serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous.

Lesion at the elbowThe term cubital tunnel syndrome is often used for ulnar nerve compression at the elbow.Total paralysis of the nerve, including those branches of the nerve serving the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, causes wasting along medial side of forearm.Paralysis of the nerve also leads to weakness of flexion of fouh and fifth fingers; if proximal poions of these fingers are held steady, patient is unable to flex terminal phalanges.With paralysis of hypothenar muscles, abduction of fifth finger is impossible.Paralysis of interossei and medial two lumbricals causes 'claw hand' deformity, mainly seen in the ulnar fingers.There may be wasting of hypothenar muscles, interossei and medial pa of thenar eminence.Also there is weakness in movement of fingers and abduction to the extended thumb against the palm.There is sensory loss of the dorsal and palmar aspects of the medial side of the hand together with the medial one and a half fingers.With compression of the ulnar nerve, the ulnar nerve is often palpably enlarged in the ulnar groove and for a sho distance proximal to the elbow.II. Lesion at the wristCutaneous sensation of hand and fingers is often spared.If lesion is just proximal to the wrist, it causes impaired sensation on the palmar aspects of hand and the fouh and fifth fingers and muscle weakness, especially in the hypothenar eminence.Adductor pollicis will be injured in ulnar nerve injuries so patient will hold the book by using the flexor pollicis longus (supplied by median nerve).This is the basis of book test/froment sign.Positive Tinel's sign on percussion over ulnar nerve at wrist (light percussion over the nerve causes a sensation of \"pins and needles\" in the distribution of the nerve, i.e. ulnar side of hand and fouh and fifth fingers).

Other causes are\nneurogenic bladder leading to urinary stasis\na foreign body eg. Foley catheter and forgotten DJ stent, which serve as nidi for stones.\nbladder diverticula\nBladder stones are commonly seen in older men (>50 yrs.) usually because of bladder outlet obstruction\nIn the Western world bladder stones are rare in pediatric population but bladder stones are endemic in children in underdeveloped nations (in North Africa, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia i.e. found near the tropics). This is because of low-protein, high carbohydrate diet and chronic dehydration. These are usually ammonium urate stones.\nCommon vesical stones are\nUric acid stones &\nStruvite stones\nOther less common stone types are\nOxalate stones\nCystine stones\nStruvite stones are also known as 'Jack stones' because of their rough surface as against the smooth surface of uric acid stones.\nStruvite stones are composed of ammonium, magnesium and calcium phosphates and occurs in urine infected with urea-splitting organisms, eg.

But a 'cold' nodule does not necessarily mean malignant. Only 20% of cold nodules turn out to be malignant, and about 5% of hot nodules can be malignant. Thus routine isotope scanning is no longer used to distinguish benign from malignant.\nFNAC is the investigation of choice for a solitary thyroid nodule.\nThe finding of a malignant diagnosis on FNAC is associated with a high accuracy rate (-100%), but the false negative rate of FNAC is high (1-6%). Thus benign nodules should be kept under observation. An inconclusive FNA needs aggressive management. A repeat FNA is done. If still inconclusive, the pt. can be kept under observation if risk factors are low. Alternatively, if risk factors are high as in the present case, the pt. can undergo hemithyroidectomy to remove the nodule and sent for histopathology.

The lymph node status is the most impoant prognostic indicator for tumor localized to breast, as the presence of nodal metastasis implies systemic dissemination of cancer and hence a bad prognosis. But once a metastasis is discovered, the lymph node status is of little significance. Metastatic disease confers the breast tumor TNM stage IV status, with worst prognosis. Currently stage IV diseases are not curative. Schwaz 9/e writes - \"Treatment for stage IV breast cancer is not curative, but may prolong survival and enhance a women's quality of life. Hormonal therapies that are associated with minimal toxicity are preferred to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Appropriate candidates for initial hormonal therapy include women with hormone receptor-positive cancers; women with bone or soft tissue metastasis only; and women with limited and asymptomatic visceral metastasis. About hormone receptors, CSDT 11/e, p 329 writes - \"the presence or absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the cytoplasm of tumor cells is of paramount impoance in managing all patients with breast cancer, especially those with recurrent or metastatic disease. They are of proved value in determining adjuvant therapy and therapy for patients with advanced disease. Upto 60% of patients with metastatic breast cancer will respond to hormonal manipulation if their tumors contain estrogen receptors.

        "question": "In nonunion of scaphoid vescularized muscle pedicle graft is taken from.",
        "exp": "C i.e. Pronator quadrates Blood supply of scaphoid enters distally mainly through the dorsal ridge (spiral groove, narrow non aicular region in the waist) and proximal segment is supplied by retrograde intraosseous blood flow from distal to proximal. This unusual pattern of vascularity is responsible for higher probability of nonunion & avascular necrosis of proximal fragment in fractures of scaphoid. Therefore 0-1% of distal third, 20% of middle third, 40% of proximal third and 100% of proximal pole fractures result in AVN and nonunion. Scaphoid Fracture Functional Anatomy & Epidemiology Scaphoid is the most commonly fractured bone in the - carpusQ, in adult as well as children. However unlike in adults and adolescents, the fracture is rare in young children. (d/t cailagenous nature of carpal bones in children) Scaphoid fracture is seen most commonly in males between the ages of 15 and 30. (adolscents & adults)Q - Scaphoid may be divided into proximal, middle and distal thirds. The middle third is termed the waist. The scaphoid tubercle forms the distal volar prominence. Middle third (Waist) fractures are most commonQ accounting for - 70% of scaphoid fractures > proximal pole fracture (20%) > distal pole fracture (10%), in adults & adolescents. Investigation Distal pole avulsion type fracture is most common fracture type in children Q. Anteroposterior, lateral and oblique views are all essential; often a recent fracture shown only in the oblique viewQ. So a routine scaphoid x- ray series must include:- Radial and ulnar deton PA views with the wrist in about 30deg of extension (by asking to make a fist gently) True lateral view Radial oblique (supinated PA) view and ulnar oblique (pronated PA) view. Comparison view of opposite wrist. However it is common for the fracture not to be visible on the initial films. If doubt exists, the scaphoid should be immobilized in plaster and repeat radiograph obtained in 1421 days as the late films are usually positiveQ. Bone scan, trispiral tomography are other investigations ; occult scaphoid fractures can be reliably diagnosed by MRI & nucleotide scan. Vascularity, Nonunion & AVN Blood supply of scaphoid is precarious. It receives most of its blood supply from two major vascular pedicles (dorsal & volar branches) from the radial aery, both entering distallyQ. Volar (palmar) scaphoid branch of radial aery enters the scaphoid tubercle and supplies its distal 20-30%. Dorsal scaphoid branch of radial aery enters through numerous small foramina along the spiral groove & dorsal ridge and account for 80% of its blood supply. There is usually no or rarely a single perforater proximal to the waist of scaphoid. Hence vascularity of proximal fragment is maintained by retrograde intraosseous blood flow from distal to proximal; 7080% of which is provided by dorsal branch. The distal scaphoid has a dense vascular network whereas intraosseous vascular density declines proximally, leaving the proximal pole with sparse blood supply. Because of this unusual retrograde vascular supply to proximal segment, the scaphoid has a high risk of nonunion and AVN after fracture through waist and proximal pole. Because the scaphoid aiculates with four carpal bones & radius, most of its surface is composed of aicular cailage. Therefore, the vascular supply comes through -a narrow non aicular region in the waist. Most of the blood supply to the scaphoid enters distally, so blood supply of scaphoid diminishes proximallyQ. This accounts for the fact that 1% of distal third, 20% of middle third, 40% of proximal third and 100% of proximal pole fractures result in avascular necrosis or non union of the proximal fragment2. -Because it aiculates with distal radius, and with 4 of remaining 7 carpal bones, the scaphoid moves with nearly all carpal motions, especially volar flexion. Any alteration of its aicular surface through fracture, dislocation, or subluxation or any change of its stability by ligamentous rupture can cause severe secondary changes throughout the entire carpus. Management Stable and undisplaced fractures are treated by scaphoid cast immobilization (glass holding dorsal and radial flexion positionQ impacts the scaphoid fragments and minimises the shearing effects), for 4 - 8 weeks in distal third, 6 - 12 weeks in middle third and 12- 20 weeks in proximal third fractures. Scaphoid cast is applied from the upper forearm to just sho of meta carpophalyngeal joints of fingers, but incorporating proximal phalynx of thumb. The wrist is held dorsiflexed and the thumb forwards in \"glass holding position\" - A displaced fracture, by definition, is one with > 1 mm of step-off or >60degof scapholunate or >15deg of lunato- capitate angulation. The subtle signs of displacement or instability are - opening & obliquity of fracture line, angulation of distal fragment, and fore shoening of scaphoid image. Displaced- unstable fractures are treated by percutaneous screw fixation or OR & IF by k - wires, compression screw or Herbe screw. - Undisplaced ununited (nonunion) fractures may be treated by excavation of the scaphoid & placement of volar inlay coicocancellous bone graft (Matti Russe procedure). In most cases of stable nonunion cancellous bone graft from either the distal radius (for small defects) or the iliac crest (preferable because of its superior osteogenic and mechanical propeies) is packed into the defect. Dorsal cailage is not disturbed. This provides a hinge and facilitates assessment of scaphoid length. If fracture site is angulated or collapsed coico cancellous volar graft is employed to correct the deformity. If the proximal pole is avascular and no significant radiocarpal ahritis is present, revascularization of the scaphoid with a vascularized bone graft from dorsal radius or preferably pronator quadratus graftQ should be performed. Paial radial stylodectomy should be performed in all patients with radiological signs of stage I radioscaphoid ahritis limited to scaphoid and radial styloid. - Once degenerative ahritis is evident at the radio -carpal joint, salvage procedures includes proximal row carpectomy, scaphoid excision and mid carpal ahodesis or total wrist ahrodesis. Clinical Presentation - The patient is usually and adolescent boy or young adult who gives a h/o falling on outstretched hand usually during active spos. Commonly the injury is misinterpreted as \"just a sprain\". Like colle's it is a supination - dorsiflexion injury. - Fullness & tenderness in anatomical snuff boxQ. Radial side wrist pain; passive dorsiflexion to the radial side is painful, grip is weak and release of grip gives transitory pain, resisted pinch between the thumb and index finger is uncomfoable. Proximal pressure along the axis of the thumb may be painfulQ.",

        "exp": "Duodenotomy, with ligation of bleeding vessel, truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty. The surgical treatment for peptic ulcer disease has changed dramatically. The elective operations for peptic ulcer disease have been viually eliminated! Antibiotics have become primary anti-ulcer therapy with the realization that in most cased, peptic ulceration is an infectious disease. Operative interventions are now reserved for complications of the ulcer disease. 3 complications are most common: - hemorrhage - perforation - obstruction For gastric ulcers, surgical indications also include intractability or nonhealing of the ulcer because of the risk of cancer. Management of hemorrhage: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the intial diagnostic test if peptic ulcer is suspected, following resuscitation. Endoscopy is able to identify the site and source of bleeding in over 90 % of patients. First line of treatment for bleeding ulcer is endoscopic hemostasis. Methods of endoscopic therapy include: -Thermal coagulation by bipolar electrocoagulation or - Direct application of heat through a heater probe or - Injection of epinephrine into the base of the bleeding peptic ulcer Operative intervention is required when -The endoscopic treatment fails - There is massive hemorrhage leading to shock or cardiovascular instability - Prolonged blood loss requiring continuing transfusion - Recurrent hemorrhage requiring hospitalization Emergent operative therapy consists of duodenotomy with direct suture ligagtion of the bleeding vessel in the ulcer base. Post operatively patients are given antibiotic therapy against H. pylori. According to Maingot- role of acid reducing surgeries like vagotomy have decreased significantly. But steps like vagotomy combined with pyloroplasty or antrectomy are still being performed depending on individual preferences to cure the ulcer. Here this patient not controlled by endoscopic methods should undergo emergent surgery consisting of only duodenotomy and bleeding vessel ligation. But since this is not one of the options we would choose the one with the least morbidity. As mentioned above another indication for surgery in gastric ulcer is failure of a recurrent ulcer to respond to medical therapy. This is because of the risk of cancer in nonhealing gastric ulcer (there is no such risk in duodenal ulcer). For benign gastric ulcer, the elective operation of choice is usually a distal gastrectomy including the ulcer with either gastroduodenal (Billroth I) or gastrojejunal (Billroth 11) anastomosis.",

They are three to four times more frequent in women than men. The impoance of discrete swellings lies in the increased risk of neoplasia compared with other thyroid swellings. Some 15% of isolated swellings prove to be malignant, and an additional 3040% are follicular adenomas. The remainders are non-neoplastic. Isotope scan Isotope scanning used to be the mainstay of investigation of discrete thyroid swellings to determine the functional activity relative to the surrounding gland according to isotope uptake. On scanning, swellings are categorised as 'hot' (overactive), 'warm' (active) or 'cold' (underactive). About 80% of discrete swellings are cold. The risk of malignancy is higher in \"cold\" lesions (20%) compared to \"hot\" or \"warm\" lesions (<5%). FNAC is the investigation of choice in discrete thyroid swellings. But it is unable to distinguish between follicular adenoma from carcinoma. Treatment Approximately 50% of these nodules decrease in size in response to the TSH suppression, and others may not continue to grow, but it is most effective for nodules <3 cm The main indication for operation is the risk of neoplasia.

Ultrasound is often the first imaging investigation but CT is the best imaging investigation. Serum amylase is the most widely used laboratory test because of its simplicity. It lacks the specificity to pancreas and may be raised in a multitude of condition causing high false positive reactions. Moreover there can be cases of acute pancreatitis with normal serum amylase levels. Serum amylase level usually return to normal after 48 to 72 hrs of acute episode, fuher limiting its usefulness. Serum Lipase is now the single best enzyme to measure for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Its level remains elevated for much longer duration of time (7 to 14 days) Other specific serum markers for acute pancreatitis are: - pancreatic isoamylase - trypsinogen One more fact about serum amylase is woh mentioning - There is no significant correlation between the magnitude of serum amylase elevation and severity of pancreatitis, in fact, a milder form of acute pancreatitis is often associated with higher levels of serum amylase as compared with that in a more severe form of the disease. Surgical treatment is needed rarely in acute pancreatitis. The disease is self limited in -85% to 90% of patients and subsides within 3-7 days.

        "question": "Which of the following statement about volvulus is False:",
        "exp": "Ans is 'c'' i.e. Lower GI scopy is contraindicated in sigmoid volvulus Volvulus describes a condition in which there is rotation of a segment of the intestine on an axis formed by its mesentery resulting in paial or complete obstruction of the lumen and may be followed by circulatory impairment of the bowel. Most common site is colon, among which following are involved in descending order - Sigmoid volvulus (- 75%) - Cecal volvulus (< 25%) - Transverse colon - Splenic flexure - Sigmoid volvulus Most common site of volvulus Volvulus can occur in any segment of large bowel that is attached to a long and floppy mesentery that is fixed to the retroperitoneum by a narrow base of origin. The mesenteric anatomy is such that volvulus is most commonly seen in sigmoid colon. Associated predisposing factors are : - age : average age of presentation is 60-70 yrs. - chronic constipation - institutionalized or neurologically impaired or psychiatric patients (their medication may decrease intestinal motility, or they may fail to pass stool regularly, leading to fecal loaded large bowel predisposing to volvulus) - diet high in fibre and vegetables (as in third world countries) Signs and symptoms are those of acute or subacute intestinal obstruction. X-ray picture is dramatic - there is a markedly dilated sigmoid colon with the appearance of a bent inner tube or coffee bean appearance. Inferior convergence of the dilated loop points towards left side of pelvis. - contrast enema demonstrates the point of obstruction with the pathognomic 'birds beak' or 'bird of prey' or 'ace of spades' sign. Management of sigmoid volvulus Unless there are obvious signs of gangrene or peritonitis, the initial management is resuscitation followed by endoscopic decompression and detorsion. Decompression/detorsion can be achieved by placement of rectal tube through a proctoscope or the use of a colonoscope. If detorsion / decompression cannot be achieved with either the rectal tube or colonoscope, laprotomy with resections of the sigmoid colon is done. Even if detorsion of the sigmoid volvulus is successful, risk of recurrence is high (approx. 50%). Hence an effective sigmoid colectomy is indicated after the pt. has stabilized. Any evidence of bowel gangrene or perforation contraindicates non-operative decompression and an immediate surgical exploration is done. Cecal volvulus The condition commonly referred to as cecal volvulus is actually a cecocolic volvulus and consists of an axial rotation of the terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon. Cecal bascule - is a condition in which the cecum folds in a cephalad direction anteriorly over a fixed ascending colon. This causes intermittent bouts of abdominal pain because the mobile cecum causes intermittent episodes of Isolated cecal obstruction. It is relieved spontaneously as the cecum falls back into its normal position. Cecocolic volvulus is possible because of lack of fixation of the cecum to the retroperitoneum. Associate predisposing factors are: - previous surgery - pregnancy - malrotation - obstructing lesion of the left colon Cecocolic volvulus affects a younger age group (late 50s) than sigmoid volvulus (60s & 70s). X-ray picture - dilated cecum usually occupying the left upper quadrant. - haustral markings can be seen in the distended cecocolic segment and is a distinguishing feature from sigmoid colon in which generally there are no haustra. Management According to Schwaz Surgery - Cecal volvulus, unlike sigmoid volvulus can almost never be detorsed / decompressed endoscopically. As vascular compromise occurs early in the course of cecal volvulus, surgical exploration is necessary when the diagnosis is made. Right hemicolectomy is the procedure of choice. Sabiston surgery writes that - 'Although there have been repos of detorsion of cecocolic volvulus with a colonoscope most cases require operation to correct the volvulus and prevent ischemia.\" An aicle published in the journal 'Diseases of Colon and Rectum' - The management of Cecal Volvulus writes\"Non-operative decompression of cecal volvulus is rarely achievable\"",

        "exp": "The changes described are those of apoptosis, which is a form of programmed cell death. Apoptosis can be seen in a variety of settings. In this case, it is occurring in the context of graft-versus-host disease, which is mediated by CD8+ and CD4+ cells. Apoptosis also occurs during embryogenesis, during hormone-dependent involution in the adult (eg, during menstruation), during rapid proliferation of cell populations (eg, intestinal crypt epithelia), and in the immune system (e.g., in developing thymus). It can also occur after duct obstruction in organs such as pancreas and during some viral diseases. The hallmark of this programmed method of cell death is the fragmentation of the cell with formation of cytoplasmic blebs and apoptotic bodies that are phagocytized by other healthy cells. Caseous necrosis, such as is seen in tuberculosis, shows necrotic, amorphous granular debris surrounded by a granulomatous response. Coagulative necrosis, such as is seen in myocardial infarction, shows coagulated, anuclear cell \"ghosts.\" Gangrenous necrosis is a commonly used surgical term (eg, in diabetic feet) that does not have a precise pathologic counterpa.

However, even in a fast-induced hypoglycemic state a sulfonylurea will release insulin and drive blood glucose down even fuher. The elderly are paicularly susceptible to sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. Pa of this may relate to diet. However, expected age-related falls of renal and/or hepatic function can reduce elimination of these drugs, thereby increasing their serum levels and their effects unless dosages are reduced accordingly. This propensity for preprandial hypoglycemia is shared by the meglitinides, repaglinide and nateglinide because they, too, increase pancreatic insulin release. The thiazadolinediones (glitazones) seldom cause symptomatic hypoglycemia because they do not release insulin. The same applies to metformin, the biguanide; and acarbose (with, along with miglitol, is an aglucosidase inhibitor). Because of a longer half-life, compared with glipizide, a sulfonylurea is more likely to cause preprandial hypoglycemia. Glipizide is contraindicated in patients with liver disease because it is metabolized in the liver. Care should be taken in the elderly because of their propensity to develop hypoglycemia, which is perhaps due to decreased hepatic and renal function that is evident in this patient population. Metformin, acarbose, and pioglitazone do not produce serious hypoglycemic reactions.",

A: Frenkels LineIn rickets, the skeletal effects are due to lack of calcification of osteoid.The first changes of rickets appear in rapidly growing distal ends of ulna & radius (wrist & knee are commonly involved due to more use).Rarefaction of provisional zone of calcification with widening of epiphysis- diaphysis distance is first to appear. The most obvious change are at 'metaphysis'- where rapid growth is occurring.First change to appear is a 'loss of normal zone of provisional calcification' adjacent to metaphysis.This begins as an indistinctness of the metaphyseal margin, progressing to a 'frayed' appearance with widening of the growth plate, due to lack of calcification of metaphyseal bone.Weight bearing & stress on uncalcified bone gives rise to 'splaying' Sr 'cupping' of metaphysis.A similar but less marked effect occurs in subperiosteal layer, which may cause lack of distinctness of coical margin.Eventually a generalized reduction in bone density is seen.In the epiphysis - there may be some haziness of coical margin.Thus all findings in Rickets occur due to failure of calcification & abnormal demineralizationi. Skull changes- Pronounced calvarial demineralization- Basilar Invagination- Indistinct sutural margin- Delayed tooth eruption Premature craniostenosis- Craniotabes- Calvarial thickening following treatmentii.

Patients taking prednisone at a dose greater than 20 mg/day for three weeks or more, and patients with a Cushingoid appearance should be assumed to have HPA axis suppression and may need an increased dose of coicosteroids perioperatively.

Pleomorphic adenoma (mixed tumor): This is the commonest tumor of the major salivary gland and its marked feature id histological diversity. It is called mixed because beside epithelial element there is also myxoid, hyline, chondroid (cailaginous) and even osseous bone. About 90% of pleomorphic adenoma is seen in parotid gland ,7% is seen in submandibular gland. tail of the parotid is commonest location in the tail of parotid. Nature of tumor: It is basically a benign tumor. Recurrence rate, which is repoed to be high, was mostly due to fault in the surgical technique in the form of simple enucleation which was often used earlier. The incidence of malignant transformation increases with the duration of the tumor, being 2% for tumors present with less than 5 years duration and 10% for those of more than 15 years duration. Treatment: This tumor is radioresistant, so excision is treatment of choice. Superficial parotidectomy is the treatment of choice, this operation is known as patey's operation. In case of submandibular gland neoplasm, the whole gland is excised with paicular care to preserve the lingual and hypoglossal nerve.

Sho-bowel syndrome is a disorder clinically defined by malabsorption, diarrhea, steatorrhea, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and malnutrition. The oxalate is normally bound by calcium in the small bowel and thus is insoluble when it reaches the colon. After massive enterectomy, much of this calcium is bound by free intraluminal fats. Free oxalate is delivered to the colon, where it is absorbed. This can eventually lead to saturation of the urine with calcium oxalate crystals and result in stone formation. The most common causes of sho-bowel syndrome in adults include Crohn disease, radiation enteritis, mesenteric vascular accidents, trauma, and recurrent intestinal obstruction. In the pediatric population, necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal atresias, and intestinal volvulus are the most common etiologic factors.",

Most common age group affected is 5-8 years. Boys are affected more than girls. Left side is more common than right. Mechanism of injury Mostly it occurs due to hyperextension injury. Fracture is caused by a fall onto the outstretched hand with hyperextension at elbow. Types of supracondylar fracture Supracondylar fracture is broadly classified into extension type and flexion type. 1) Extension type It is the most common type (97 - 99%). Distal fragment is extended (tilted backward/posteriorly) in relation to proximal fragment. Occurs due to hyperextension injury after fall on outstretched hands. Generally, displacement of distal fragment may be : - i) Posteromedial (70-80%) ii) Posterolateral (20-30%) 2) Flexion type It is less common type (1-3 %) Distal fragment is flexed (tilted forward/anteriorly) in relation to proximal fragments. The mechanism of injury generally is believed to be a fall directly onto the elbow rather than a fall on outstretched hand. As the extension type fracture is more common (97 - 99%), the most common elbow injury in children is extension type of supracondylar fracture. Clinical features of supracondylar fracture Following a fall, the child is in pain and elbow is swollen. In extension type of injury, `S' shaped deformity of the elbow is obvious. There is loss of both active and passive movements of elbow. Symptoms relating to vascular and nerve injury may be seen. Unusual posterior prominence of the point of elbow (tip of olecrenon) because of backward tilt of the distal fragment. Three point bony relationship is maintained as the fracture is above the level of condyles. Dimple sign due to one of the spikes of proximal fragment penetrating the muscle and tethring the skin.",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Pseudohyperophied Duchenne muscular dystrophy is by far the most common childhood-onset muscular dystrophy, afflicting 1 in 3300 boys with an overall prevalence of 63 cases per million. One third of these cases are due to spontaneous mutations, while the rest are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Duchenne muscular dystrophy clinically manifests in patients aged 3-7 years, with development of lordosis, a waddling gait, and the Cowers sign. Calf pseudohyperophy follows 1-2 years later. Most patients are wheelchair bound by age 12 years. Diagnostic criteria include: Weakness with onset in the legs; Hyperlordosis with wide-based gait; Hyperophy of weak muscles; Progressive course over time; Reduced muscle contractility on electrical stimulation in advanced stages of the disease; and (6) absence of bladder or bowel dysfunction, sensory disturbance, or febrile illness. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is much more than a disease of skeletal muscles. Dystrophin is also found in the hea, brain, and smooth muscle. Late-stage cardiac fibrosis can lead to output failure and pulmonary congestion, a common cause of death. Additionally, cardiac fibrosis can include cardiomyopathy and conduction abnormalities, which can induce fatal arrhythmias.",

The peak age of onset of multiple myeloma is 65 to 70 years of age. Multiple myeloma affects slightly more men than women. A mnemonic sometimes used to remember the common tetrad of multiple myeloma is CRAB ? C = Calcium (elevated), R = Renal failure, A = Anemia, B = Bone lesions. Myeloma bone pain usually involves the spine and ribs, and worsens with activity. Myeloma bone disease is due to proliferation of tumor cells and release of IL-6, which stimulates osteoclasts to break down bone. The breakdown of bone also leads to release of calcium into the blood, leading to hypercalcemia and its associated symptoms. These bone lesions are lytic in nature and are best seen in plain radiographs, which may show \"punched-out\" resorptive lesions. The anemia found in myeloma is usually normocytic and normochromic. The presence of unexplained anemia, kidney dysfunction, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and a high serum protein (especially raised immunoglobulin) should raise the suspicion. Protein electrophoresis of the blood and urine may show the presence of a paraprotein (monoclonal protein, or M protein) band, with or without reduction of the other (normal) immunoglobulins (known as immune paresis). One type of paraprotein is the Bence Jones protein which is a urinary paraprotein composed of free light chains. Multiple myeloma can produce all classes of immunoglobulin, but IgG paraproteins are most common, followed by IgA and IgM. IgD and IgE myeloma are very rare. Myeloma activity sometimes appear as \"lytic lesions\" (with local disappearance of normal bone due to resorption), and on the skull X-ray as \"punched-out lesions\" (pepper pot skull).",

With the exception of pain or loss of sensation in the greater occipital nerve distribution neurological sequelae are uncommon and more likely to be related to associated injuries. It is most common type of atlas fractureQ. It is cause by axial compression forceQ (with or with out extension force), resulting from a fall on the head from a height or mass falling on head. This mechanism of injury results in a burst fracture of ring of atlas (C1) veebraeQ, that occurs secondary to the occipital condyles being driven into the interior poions of the ring of atlas and driving the lateral masses outwards. Lateral displacement of C1 lateral mass lateral the outer coex of the C2 lateral mass raises concerns for the structural integrity of the transverse atlantal ligament (TAL). The stability of atlas depends on TAL. Due to outward movement of lateral masses, there is no encroachment on the neural canal and, usually, no neurological damageQ. Classical Jafferson's fracture (as described by Jafferson in 1920) was four pa fracture of ring of atlasQ (2 pa of anterior ring & 2 pa of posterior ring). However more common are two pa or three pa fractures. It is tyically diagnosed on plain radiographs - pen mouth (odontoid) view may show asymmetry of the lateral masses of C1 on C2 with overhang. - A bilateral overhang > 6.9 mm suggest disruption of transverse ligament and potential late instability. - On lateral radiograph presumptive evidence of transverse ligament disruption is >4mm atlanto-dens interval. Coronal C T reformation provides the best method of evaluating impoant atlas fracture characteristicsQ. The treatment for isolated atlas injuries is typically nonoperative - Undisplaced stable injuries are managed by semi rigid cervical collar or halo- vest until fracture unites. - Unstable injury wit transverse ligament rupture (> 7mm displacement of lateral mass) is managed by halo traction f/b halovest immobilization for a total of 3 - 4 months. - If a late instability or nonunion is present, atlanto - axial (C1 - C2) ahodesis and atlanto - occipital (cervico- occipital) fusionQ. is done Fracture of atlas are associated with injury elsewhere in cervical spine in upto 50% of cases; odontoid fractures and hangman's fractures in paicular should be excluded.",

The unique characteristic of these thrombi is that they are primarily composed of plateletso with very little. fibrin in it. The consumption of platelet leads to thrombocytopenia and the presence of intravascular thrombi causes microangiopathic hemolytic anemiaQ and widespread organ dysfunction. You must have noticed that TTP and DIC share so many similar features such as 4icrovascular occulsion and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, But they are pathologically distinct. In TTP Activation of coagulation cascade is not of primary impoance. The thrombi present are essentially platelet thrombi, hence results of laboratory tests of coagulation such as PT and PTT are usually normal. In D.I.C. The main defect is activation of coagulation system there fore PT and PTT are abnormal. Patients with TTP are deficient in an enzyme called ADAMTSB. This enzyme is also known as vWf in etalloprotease. This enzyme normally degrades very high molecular weight multimers of von-Willebrand .factor. In the absence of this enzyme, these multimers of vWF accumulate in plasma and under some circumstances promote platelet macroaggregate.formation throughout the microcirculation leading to symptoms of TTP. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a thrombotic microangiopathy. The other disorders which is included in this group include H.

Obvious exceptions include patients who cannot tolerate an abdominal operation, and patients with overwhelming metastatic disease.\" Bailey writes \"It is impoant that patients with incurable disease are not subjected to radical surgery that cannot help them. Unequivocal evidence of incurability is hematogenous metastasis, involvement of distant peritoneum, N4 nodal disease and disease beyond the N4 nodes, and fixation to structures that cannot be removed. It is impoant to note that involvement of another organ per se does not imply incurability, provided that it can be removed\". About lymph nodes involvement and curability Schwaz writes ? \"It should be strongly emphasized that many patients with positive lymph nodes are cured by adequate surgery. It should be stressed that after lymphnodes that appear to be involved with tumor turn out to be benign or reactive on pathological examination. Therefore therapeutic nihilism should be avoided, and in the low risk patients an aggressive attempt to resect all tumors should be made. The primary tumor may be resected en bloc with adjacent involved organs (eg. distal pancreas, transverse colon or spleen) during the course of curative gastrectomy. Palliative gastrectomy may be indicated in some patients with obviously incurable disease, but most patients presenting with stage IV gastric cancer can he managed without major operation.\" Thus any lymph node involvement is no indication against operation (except Bailey's N4 node and beyond. We are sorry, we don't know what this Bailey's N4 node means, but know this that Japanese have classified lymphnodes only upto N3 (Ref: Schwaz 9/e p933 (8/e p979) A solitary metastatic nodule in liver is also no indication against curable resection Krunkenberg's tumor i.e. metastasis to b/1 ovaries is indication against curable resection.

In newborn infants, capillary refill can be measured by pressing on the sternum for five seconds with a finger or thumb, and noting the time needed for the colour to return once the pressure is released. The upper normal limit for capillary refill in newborns is 3 seconds. The capillary refill time (C) is a common indication of dehydration and decreased peripheral perfusion. It is very useful as suppoing evidence for a positive sign of poor perfusion to the extremities. The C test is often referred to as the Nail blanch test.

Dysplasia of the wing of the sphenoid bone, results in poor formation of the wall and/or floor of the orbit.

This condition is often seen in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders (such as lupus and leucocytoclastic vasculitis) lymphoproliferative malignancies and in as many as one half of cases HCV infection. Cryoglobulinemia may also be classified based on the association with an underlying disease : -Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia When the cryoglobulins are a mixture of various antibody types and forms for unknown reasons, the condition is called essential mixed cryoglobulinemia. However the discovery of a close association between hepatitis virus (HCV) and mixed cryoglobulinemia has tasted doubt on the existence of essential or idiopathic cryoglobulinemia. Current evidence suggests that in majority of cases essential mixed cryoglohulinemia occurs when an aberrant immune response to Hepatitis C infection leads to formation of immune complexes consisting of :-- Hepatitis C antigen - Polyclonal hepatitis C specific IgG - Monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor These immune complexes are thought to outstrip reticuloendohelial clearing activity.

Prevention of fuher bleeding is usually accomplished with repeated variceal band ligation until varices are obliterated.\" Maingot's writes- \"The current standard for endoscopic therapy for esophageal varices is endoscopic banding. This has largely replaced endoscopic sclerotherapy because it has fewer side effects, obliterates varices faster, and, with new technology, can be easily applied.- Also know: Cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding have a high risk of developing bacterial infections, which are associated with ro rebleeding and a higher moality rate.

LES comprises the lower 4 cm of esophagus, where resting pressure within the lumen normally exceeds the intragastric pressure. This high intraluminal pressure at LES prevents the GE reflux. The LES is a physiological entity rather than any anatomical structure. Factors contribute to the high intraluminal pressure of LES: Intrinsic musculature of distal esophagus: these muscles differ from those in the other area of the esophagus in that they are in a state of tonic contraction. They normally relax with initiation of the a swallow and then return to a state of tonic contraction. Sling fibres of cardia Crura of the diaphragm Intra Abdominal pressure: the intra abdominal pressure compresses the abdominal segment of the esophagus and is probably the most impoant factor in preventing the reflux. The gastroesophageal angle: the oblique entry of the esophagus has a valvular effect, in that it closes the esophagus when gastric fundus distends. Folds of the mucosa at the cardia : helps in closing the LES when intragastric pressure arises.

Given these facts, which of the following statements can be true at one time or another?",
        "exp": "The plasma membranes of intestinal epithelial cells contain a sodium gradient that drives the active transpo of glucose. The rate and amount of glucose transpoed depend upon the sodium gradient maintained across the plasma membrane. Sodium ions entering the cell in the company of glucose are pumped out again by Na+,K+-ATPase. Once in the cytosol of the intestinal cell, the glucose moves across the cell and diffuses out of the cell into the interstitial fluid of the submucosa and then into the plasma of the capillaries underlying the intestinal epithelium. This occurs for the following reason: while glucose is maintained in blood plasma at an approximately constant level, it is always slowly moving out of the plasma into the cells of tissue that use it. Given that the diffusion from the intestinal cells into the plasma is passive, the intestinal cells and the plasma try to maintain an equilibrium. Thus, plasma glucose levels are always approximately equal to or slightly less than levels in the intestinal cells. Due to the passive maintenance of this equilibrium, it is highly unlikely that the concentration of glucose in the plasma can get much higher than that in the intestinal cell cytosol. It is also unlikely that the levels of glucose in other tissues of the body (for example, muscle) will have any bearing on those found in the intestinal cells",

The translocation places the myc oncogene on chromosome 8 downstream of the very active heavy chain locus on chromosome 14, activating myc gene expression in B cells and their derivatives. The translocation is likely an aberrant form of the normal DNA rearrangements that generate unique heavy chain genes in each B cell. The translocation joins one chromosome 8 to one chromosome 14, leaving their homologues unaffected. The cause for the phenotype must therefore be trans-acting, since cis-acting effects would peain only to the translocated loci and not affect the homologous untranslocated loci. Activation of a tumor-promoting gene (oncogene) on chromosome 8 could produce an enlarged tonsil, while underactivity of immunoglobulin production due to one-half expression could decrease immune function but would not completely ablate the processes in choices a, b, d, and e. At the genetic level, trans-acting events are autosomal dominant in that one of the two homologous loci is abnormal and produces a phenotype.

Its primary function is to prevent anterior translation of the tibia in reference to the femur (or posterior displacement of the femur in reference to the tibia). The Lachman test is the most sensitive examination maneuver for evaluating a anterior cruciate ligament tear. The test is performed with the knee flexed to 30 degrees and the tibia is translated anteriorly with respect to the femur. It is positive if there is increased translation as compared to the opposite side, or more translation than normal. Note: The lateral collateral ligament originates on the lateral femoral epicondyle and inses on the head of the fibula. It functions to prevent varus instability of the knee. When a varus stress (adducted) is placed on the tibia, the lateral collateral ligament becomes taut and prevents displacement. The medial collateral ligament originates from the medial femoral epicondyle and inses on the medial proximal tibia. Its function is to prevent valgus instability of the knee. When a valgus stress is placed on the tibia, the medial collateral ligament is stressed and prevents displacement. The patellar ligament runs from the inferior pole of the patella to the tibial tubercle, and is commonly referred to as the patellar tendon. However, this structure connects bone to bone, which is the definition of a ligament, not a tendon. Ref: Textbook of Ohopaedics & Trauma Vol 1 Page 2940.",

        "exp": "\"All listed methods are used in the management of intra aicular fracture\" Intra aicular fracture Intra aicular fracture are those in which the break crosses into the surface of a joint. They always result in some degree of cailage damage. Ideally the joint surface should be restored to their original position and held there strongly enough that movement may be staed in the early postoperative period. some permanent loss of motion is to be expected and joint may develop degenerative ahritis as a result of the injury. Principles of intra aicular fracture Immobilization of intra aicular fracture results in joint stiffness Immobilization of aicular fracture, treated by open reduction and internal fixation, results in much greater stiffness. Depressed aicular fragments, which do not reduce as a result of closed manipulation and traction, are impacted and will not reduced by closed means. Major aicular depression do not fill with fibrocailage and the instability which results from their displacement, is permanent. Anatomical reduction and stable fixation of aicular fragment is necessary to restore joint congruity. Immediate motion is necessary to prevent joint stiffness and to ensure aicular healing and recovery. This require stable internal fixation. Radius fracture treatment ( of distal end i.e. intra aicular pa) K wire fixation may be helpful for smaller fragments. cast immobilization is indicated for nondisplaced fracture, displaced fractures with a stable fracture pattern. The cast should be worn approximately 6 weeks or until radiographic evidence of union has occured. Ahrodesis In this operation, fusion is achieved between the bones forming a joint so as to eliminate any motion at the joint. An ahrodesis is used most often for a painful, stiff joint. It is also performed for grossly unstable joints in polio etc. It is also used for grossly unstable joint due to trauma. Excision and aspiration of hematoma excision of damaged poion of bone and aspiration of intra aicular hematoma, are also included in management of intra aicular fracture.
