        "exp": "Ans. a (Middle meningeal artery). (Ref: B & L, Surgery, 25th/ 303).Extradural haematoma (EDH)# It is a neurosurgical emergency. An EDH is nearly always associated with a skull fracture and is more common in young male patients. The skull fracture is asso- ciated with tearing of a meningeal artery and a haematoma accumulates in the space between bone and dura. The most common site is temporal, as the pterion is not only the thinnest part of the skull but also overlies the largest meningeal artery - the middle meningeal.# An EDH may also occur in other regions such as frontal as well as in the posterior fossa. They are not always arte- rial: disruption of a major dural venous sinus can result in an EDH. The force required to sustain a skull fracture can be surprisingly small - a fall from standing or a single blow to the head.# The classical presentation of an EDH, occurring in less than one-third of cases, is initial injury followed by a lucid interval when the patient complains of a headache but is fully alert and orientated with no focal deficit. After minutes or hours a rapid deterioration occurs, with contralateral hemiparesis, reduced conscious level and ipsilateral pupillary dilatation as a result of brain compression and herniation.FEATUREEDH (EXTRADURAL HEMATOMA)SDH (SUBDURAL HEMATOMA)Incidence1-4%10-20%EtiologyLacerated middle meningeal artery/ dural sinus in 70 to 85% cases.Stretching, tearing of bridging cortical veins.AgeAnyOlder peoplefractureSeen in 85-95% cases-LocationBetween skull & dura.95% supratentorialCrosses dural attachments but not sutures.Between dura & arachnoid95% supratentorialCrosses suture but not dural attachmentBilateral5%15%CT- Biconvex (lentiform shape)- 2/3 hyperdense (- 1/3 mixed density)- Displace greywhite interfacea) Acute SDH: Crescentic & hyperdenseb) Subacute SDH: May be nearly isodense with cortex neo-membrane, underlying vessels may enhance.c) Chronic SDH: Hypodense with enhancing membrane.

The metabolic compensation to induced hypocapnia leads to normalization of the pH by loss of bicarbonate (metabolic acidosis), and over 8-24 h the beneficial effects of the hypocapnia will have been lost. The partial pressures of carbon dioxide should be allowed to slowly return to normal and should be held in reserve in case unanticipated increases in ICP require another pulse of short-term reduction.

The lesion appears as a hyperdense biconvex mass between the skull and brain on CT scan. Clinical presentation is highly variable and outcome largely depends on promptness of diagnosis and surgical evacuation. The typical history is one of head trauma followed by a momentary alteration in consciousness and then a lucid interval lasting for up to a few hours. This is followed by a loss of consciousness, dilation of the pupil on the side of the epidural hematoma, and then compromise of the brainstem and death. Treatment consists of temporal craniectomy, evaluation of the hemorrhage, and control of the bleeding vessel. The mortality of epidural hematoma is approximately 50%.",

Beta 2 transferrin is specific for CSF.> Analysis of the collected nasal fluid can be both problematic and useful. Analysis of nasal fluid is problematic because simple testing such as observing how the drainage dries on paper (Ring sign) or measuring the sugar content (reflecting the elevated glucose content of CSF) may not be valid.> Presence of the enzyme Beta2-transferrinase is only found in CSF, but requires the collection of several milliliters of fluid to be sent for highly specialized laboratory testing.> To confirm or further identify the route of CSF rhinorrhea, three forms of imaging are available.> Isotope cisternogram is the most sensitive, but least specific form of imaging. Nuclear medicine study consists of placing a low yield radioactive isotope in the subarachnoid space via a lumber puncture or spinal tap. Presence of isotope containing CSF in the nose is confirmed by measuring radioactivity within the nasal cavity or on cotton pledgets placed at probable sites of cerebral spinal fluid drainage from the cranial cavity. Contrast CT cisternography is a more specific, but a less sensitive form of imaging for CSF rhinorrhea. Requires an active leakage of CSF to the nose and involves the placement of an agent opaque to CT imaging within the subarachnoid space. Coronal CT scan is then performed to image the defect within the floor of the anterior or middle cranial fossa, and the route of drainage into the nose.> Magnetic resonance imaging is a non-radiographic procedure utilizing the detection of electromagnetic energy released from the hydrogen atom as the electron circling the nucleus descends to a lower energy level. Soft tissue contains various amounts of water and the physics of detecting changes in energy rather than density (as in the case of CT) significantly favor the former. MR imaging is the examination of choice tor visualizing potential brain anomalies, such as encephaloceles (herniation of brain into the nose or ear). MR also permits the identification of CSF draining into the nose without the use of contract, but does not visualize well bony detect in the skull base or currently lacks the detail provided by CT cisternography.",

Increased ICP compresses cerebral arteries, causing increased cerebrovascular resistance (CVR). FLOW Ranging from 20ml 100g-1 min-1 in white matter to 70ml 100g-1 min-1 in grey matter.> Autoregulation: Under normal circumstances a MAP between 60 to 160 mmHg and ICP about 10 mmHg (CPP of 50-150 mmHg) sufficient blood flow can be maintained with autoregulation. Although the classic 'autoregulation curve' suggests that CBF is fully stable between these blood pressure values (known also as the limits of autoregulation), CBF may vary as much as 10% below and above its average within this range. Outside of the limits of autoregulation, raising MAP raises CPP and raising ICP lowers it (this is one reason that increasing ICP in traumatic brain injury is potentially deadly). In trauma some recommend CPP not go below 70 mmHg. Recommendations in children is at least 60 mmHg. Within the autoregulatory range, as CPP falls there is, within seconds, vasodilatation of the cerebral resistance vessels, a fall in cerebrovascular resistance and a rise in cerebral-blood volume (CBV), and therefore CBF will return to baseline value within seconds. These adaptations to rapid changes in blood pressure (in contrast with changes that occur over periods of hours or days) are known as dynamic cerebral autoregulation.",

        "exp": "Subdural hematomas usually arise from tears in the veins bridging from the cerebral cortex to the dura or venous sinuses, often after only minor head injuries. They can become apparent several days after the initial injury. Treatment is with drainage of the hematoma through a burr hole; a formal craniotomy may be required if the fluid reaccumulates. Significant brain contusions due to blunt trauma are usually associated with at least transient loss of consciousness; similarly, epidural hematomas result in a period of unconsciousness, although a \"lucid interval\" may follow during which neurologic findings are minimal.Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the absence of antecedent trauma most commonly arises from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, which typically is found at the bifurcation of the major branches of the circle of Willis. Other less frequent causes include hypertensive hemorrhage, trauma, and bleeding from an arteriovenous malformation. Patients present with the sudden onset of an excruciating headache. Complaints of a stiff neck and photophobia are common. Loss of consciousness may be transient or evolve into frank coma. Cranial nerve palsies are seen as a consequence both of increased intracranial pressure due to hemorrhage and pressure of the aneurysm on adjacent cranial nerves. CT scans followed by cerebral arteriography help to confirm the diagnosis as well as to identify the location of the aneurysm. Treatment consists of surgical ligation of the aneurysm by placing a clip across its neck. Early surgical intervention (within 72 h of SAH) may prevent aneurysmal rebleeding and allow aggressive management of post hemorrhage vasospasm.",

He is unable to move his legs and complains of severe pain in his mid to lower back. On physical examination, he is found to have exquisite tenderness over some of the bony prominence of his lower back, but no gross physical deformity can be appreciated. On neurologic examination, flaccid paralysis of both lower extremities and complete anesthesia to all sensory modalities below approximately the L3 dermatome are noted. Catheterization of his bladder yields approximately 700 mL of urine. Plain radiographs of the spine reveal compression fracture in the body of L3 with greater than 50% of loss in its height. A computed tomography (CT) scan through this area reveals a burst fracture of the body of L3. There are large fragments of bone driven dorsally with an 80% canal compromise. What is the cause of weakness?",
        "exp": "This patient has suffered a traumatic fracture of L3 in which bony fragments were displaced dorsally to compress the cauda equina at that level. It is important to remember that the spinal cord does not extend along the entire length of the spine. The conus medullaris, the most caudal tip of the spinal cord, ends in 98% of people at or above L2 vertebrae.

The EEG may likely show the presence of seizure activity and even localize it to a particular region of the brain; it will not, however, answer the question of what pathologic process is responsible.

In the oral mucosa, they may be observed in the lips, dorsa of tongue, and palate. Dental pitting occurs in about 90% of patients.

White macules offer an excellent opportunity for early diagnosis because they may be found at birth or early infancy. The use of Wood lamp accentuates these macules. Color, even though described as white, lacks the depigmented white appearance of vitiligo. Careful examination is necessary before making any firm diagnosis because hypopigmented macules may be a normal finding in newborn babies. 3 or more white macules at birth should alert the clinician regarding the possibility of tuberous sclerosis.
