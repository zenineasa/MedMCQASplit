Most of the primary lymphomas (about 60%) arise in MALT (mucosa associated lymphoid tissue). MALT is usually associated with chronic H. pylori infection. So low-grade MALT lymphomas are thought to arise because of chronic H. pylori infection. These low grade lymphomas may later on degenerate to high grade lymphomas Immunodeficiency and H. pylori infection are risk factors for B cell lymphoma. Most common site of involvement (like that of adenocarcinoma) is gastric antrum. Secondary gastric lymphoma Stomach is the most common extranodal site of systemic lymphoma. Almost all of them are Non-Hodgkins types Treatment The role of gastric resection is controversial. Recent studies have shown similar disease free 5 year survival rates in patients treated with surgery+chemotherapy+radiotherapy and patients treated with chemotherapy+ radiation therapy alone. (Most patients with high grade gastric lymphomas are now treated with chemoradiation alone, without surgical resection. For disease limited to the stomach and regional nodes, radical subtotal gastrectomy may be performed, especially for bulky tumors with bleeding and/or obstruction.)

Plasma levels of CEA can be determined readily by radioimmunoassay. However, its usefulness in colon carcinogenesis screening is limited because of its high level in the plasma of a patient&;s malignancies originating from other sites such as breast, pancreas, stomach and lung. Fuhermore, CEA plasma levels may also be increased in smokers or patients with chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, bronchitis and alcoholic liver disease. The clinical usefulness of CEA for screening purposes is fuher limited by the fact that its increase in level typically occurs only when the tumor penetrates through the serosa. Thus, early lesions may not be detected by serum CEA level changes. CEA is typically elevated with metastatic liver disease, but rarely with peritoneal involvement. Thus, while the specificity for CEA to identify occult CRCs is high, the sensitivity is low in most studies for screening. Accordingly, CEA is not a useful test for the screening of CRC.

This prolapsed ureteral mucosa carries with it a poion of the continuous sheet of the bladder mucosa around the orifice. The prolapsed segment thus has a wall that consists of a thin layer of muscle and collagen interposed between the bladder uroepithelium and the ureter uroepithelium. Since the terminal ureteral orifice is usually narrowed and paially obstructed, and since there is no muscle suppo for the double mucosal walls of the prolapsed segment, it dilates.
