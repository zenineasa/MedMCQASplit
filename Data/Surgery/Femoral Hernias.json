(a) Below and lateral to pubic tubercleRef: Bailey and love 26th ed, ch. 60 / 960* The femoral hernia appears below and lateral to the pubic tubercle and lies in the upper leg rather than in the lower abdomen. Inadequate exposure of this area during routine examination leads to failure to detect the hernia.* The hernia often rapidly becomes irreducible and loses any cough impulse due to the tightness of the neck. It may only be 1-2 cm in size and can easily be mistaken for a lymph node",
