Due to multiorgan dysfunctionQMortality after 2 weeks (late period; Caused by septic complicationsQPathophysiology:AP is the final result of abnormal pancreatic enzyme activation inside acinar cellsQ.Colocalization hypothesis: Cathepsin B-mediated intra-acinar cell activation of the digestive enzymes leads to acinar cell injury and triggers an inflammatory response.Intra-acinar pancreatic enzyme activation induces autodigestion of normal pancreatic parenchyma.Acinar cells release proinflammatory cytokines, which propagate the response locally and systemically.The local inflammatory response further aggravates the pancreatitis because it increases the permeability and damages the microcirculation of the pancreas.In severe cases, the inflammatory response causes local hemorrhage and pancreatic necrosisQ.Inflammatory cascade is self-limited in 80-90% of patientsQ.The mortality seen in the early phase of pancreatitis is the result of persistent inflammatory response.Risk factors:Gallstones (MC) and ethanol abuse (2nd MC) account for 70-80% of AP casesQ.In pediatric patients, abdominal blunt trauma and systemic diseasesQ are the two most common conditions that lead to pancreatitis.Clinical Features:Cardinal symptom: Epigastric and/or periumbilical pain that radiates to the back, relieved by sitting and leaning forwardQ.Up to 90% of patients have nausea and/or vomiting that typically does not relieve the pain.The nature of the pain is constantQ.Dehydration, poor skin turgor, tachycardia, hypotension, and dry mucous membranes are commonly seen in patients with AP.Mild pancreatitis: Abdomen may be normal or reveal only mild epigastric tenderness.Severe pancreatitis: Significant abdominal distention, associated with generalized rebound tenderness and abdominal rigidityFlank (Grey Turner)Q, periumbilical (Cullen's sign)Q and inguinal ecchymosis (Fox sign)Q are indicative of retroperitoneal bleeding associated with severe pancreatitis.Dullness to percussion and decreased breathing sounds in the left or, less commonly, in the right hemithorax suggest pleural effusionQ secondary to AP.Diagnosis:Cornerstone of the diagnosis of AP: Clinical findings + elevation of pancreatic enzyme levels in the plasmaQ.Pancreatic EnzymesA threefold or higher elevation of amylase and lipase levels confirms the diagnosisQ.Amylase's serum half-life is shorter as compared with lipase.Lipase is also a more specific marker of APQ because serum amylase levels can be elevated in a number of conditions, such as peptic ulcer disease, mesenteric ischemia, salpingitis, and macroamylasemia.Patients with AP are typically hyperglycemic; they can also have leukocytosis and abnormal elevation of liver enzyme levels.Elevation of ALT levels in the serum in the context of AP has a positive predictive value of 95% in the diagnosis of acute biliary pancreatitisQ.X-ray Abdomen; Localized ileus of duodenum and proximal jejunum (sentinel loop)Q or that of transverse colon up to its mid point (colon cut off sign)Q.IOC for acute pancreatitis: CECTTreatment:Cornerstone of the treatment: Aggressive fluid resuscitationQ using isotonic crystalloid solution with supplementary oxygenNarcotics are usually preferred, especially Buprenorphine >morphineQ as analgesics.In Acute PancreatitisNSAIDs of choiceMetamizoleQOpiate of choiceBuprenorphineQNutritional support: Enteral nutritionQ is associated with less infectious complications and reduces the need for pancreatic surgery as compared to TPN.ERCP: Beneficial for patients with severe acute biliary pancreatitis and cholangitisQ.Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: Indicated for all patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitisQ with the exception of older patients and those with poor performance statusQ",
