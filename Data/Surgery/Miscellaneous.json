Its blood:gas partition coefficient is 0.47, and it is 30 times more soluble in blood than is nitrogen (N2 ). N2 O is also the only anesthetic gas less dense than air. As a result of these properties, N2 O may cause progressive distention of air- filled spaces during prolonged anesthesia. This can lead to undesirable situations whenever there is a pneumothorax or intestinal obstruction or when procedures like pneumoventriculography (in which the intracranial air space is not free to expand in response to the diffusion of gas into the ventricles) are performed. In each of these cases the N2 O diffuses into the gas-filled compartment faster than N2 can diffuse out. Since the typical mixture of ingested air (or pneumothorax air) is 80% N2 and the usual mixture of nitrous oxide anesthetic gas is 80% N2 O, rapid increase in the size of gas-filled chambers with potentially serious consequences may occur.",

This minimally invasive technique potentially offers reduced operative time and morbidity, decreased hospital stay and earlier return to normal activities, less pain and less post-operative ileus compared with the traditional open surgical procedures.Because the postoperative benefits are superior to open surgical pro-cedures, laparoscopy is today also used in many high risk patients in ad-vanced age and pre-existent cardiopulmonary and respiratory diseases.However, insufflations of carbon dioxide into the peritoneum may lead to alteration in the acid-base balance, cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology.

Usually sheep or goat intestines are used, but it is occasionally made from the intestines of cattle, hogs, horses, mules, ordonkeys.ManufactureCatgut suture is made by twisting together strands of purified collagen taken from the serosal or submucosal layer of the small intestine of healthy ruminants (cattle,sheep, goats) or from beef tendon2 The natural plain thread is precision ground in order to achieve a monofilament character and treated with a glycerol-containing solution. The suture is sterilized with ethylene oxide gas & is of straw-coloredAlthough the name implies the usage of guts of cats, there is no record of feline guts being used for this purpose.It is a type of surgical suture that is naturally degraded by the body's own proteolytic enzymes. Absorption is complete by 90 days, and full tensile strength remains for at least 7 days. This eventual disintegration makes it good for use in rapidly-healing tissues and in internal structures that cannot be re-accessed for suture removal.Catgut suture has high knot-pull tensile strength and good knot security due to special excellent handling features. It is used for all surgical procedures including general closure, ophthalmic, orthopedics, obstetrics/gynecology and gastrointestinal surgery. It is absorbed faster in patients with cancer, anemia, and malnutrition. It also absorbed faster when used in the mouthand in the vagina, due to the presence of microorganisms.Catgut has largely been replaced by synthetic absorbable polymers such as Vicryl and polvdioxanone. It is not used at all for human surgery in some countries.In Europe and Japan, gut sutures have been banned due to concerns that they could transmit bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad-cow disease), although the herds from which gut is harvested are certified BSE-free.VariantsChromic catgut suture is a variant treated with chromic acid salts. This treatment produces roughly twice the stitch- bolding time of plain catgut, but greater tissue inflammation occurs. Full tensile strength is extended to 18-21 days. It is brown rather than straw-colored, and has improved smoothness due to the dry presentation of the thread (plain catgut is wet). It is otherwise similar to plain catgut.Fast catgut suture is heat-treated to give even more rapid absorption in the body.",

They form part of the disease process in tuberous sclerosis. Skin lesions usually appear in children under 10 years of age and increase in size and number until adolescence.

        "exp": "Ans. d. (Strapping of chest) (Ref Bailey and Love 25th/343)Localised rib fracture due to direct trauma. A simple rib fracture may be serious in elderly people or in those with chronic lung disease who have little pulmonary reserve. Uncomplicated fractures require sufficient analgesia to encourage a normal respiratory pattern and effective coughing. Oral analgesia may suffice but intercostal nerve blockade with local anesthesia may be very helpful. Chest strapping or bed rest is no longer advised and early ambulation with vigorous physiotherapy (and oral antibiotics if necessary) is encouraged. A chest radiograph is always taken to exclude an underlying pneumothorax. It is useful to confirm the skeletal injuries but routine chest radiography may miss rib fractures. However, once a pneumothorax and major skeletal injuries are excluded, the management is the same - the local control of chest pain.THE COMPONENTS OF CHEST INJURY IN BLUNT TRAUMAMajor chest wall traumaa. Flail chest: This occurs when several adjacent ribs are fractured in two places either on one side of the chest or either side of the sternum. The flail segment moves paradoxically, that is, inwards during inspiration and outwards during expiration, thereby reducing effective gas exchange. The net result is poor oxygenation from injury to the underlying lung parenchyma and paradoxical movement of the flail segment. This creates a right-to-left shunt and prevents full saturation of arterial blood. In the absence of any other injuries and, if the segment is small and not embarrassing respiration, the patient may be nursed on a high-dependency unit with regular blood gas analysis and good analgesia until the flail segment stabilises. In the more severe case, endotracheal intubation is required with positive pressure ventilation for up to 3 weeks, until the fractures become less mobile. Thoracotomy with fracture fixation is occasionally appropriate if there is an underlying lung injury to be treated at the same time. An anterior flail segment with the sternum moving paradoxically with respiration can be stabilised by internal fixation but operative management is not usual for either.b. First rib fracturec. Fractures of the sternum.d. Vertebraee. Pleuraf. Traumatic pneumothoraxg. Continuing blood loss in excess of 200 mL/hour may require urgent thoracotomy within the first few hours.h. Lung contusion.It is important to prevent infection of the underlying lung by early mobilisation (if the patient's condition permits), prophylactic antibiotics, suction drainage and physiotherapy.MANAGEMENT OF BLUNT CHEST TRAUMAMost chest injuries where the heart is not injured are managed conservatively with underwater seal drainage if necessary, and oxygen and physiotherapy to help the patient to expectorate while the underlying lung parenchyma heals. In about 10 per cent of cases a thoracotomy is required. The indications for thoracotomy following blunt thoracic trauma are the following:# 50--1000 mL of blood at the time of initial drainage is common and may need no further action, but greater volumes, especially if the blood is fresh, require intervention;# continued brisk bleeding (>100 mL/15 minutes) from the intercostal drains indicates a serious breach of the lung parenchyma and urgent exploration is required;# continued bleeding of >200 mL/hour for 3 or more hours may require thoracotomy under controlled conditions;# rupture of the bronchus, aorta, esophagus or diaphragm;# cardiac tamponade (if needle aspiration is unsuccessful).All explorations following trauma should have double-lumen tube endotracheal intubation to facilitate surgery on the injured side and to protect the undamaged lung.",

        "exp": "(A) Acute testicular torsion# TESTICULAR TORSION Usually presents with sudden, severe, testicular pain (in groin and lower abdomen) and tenderness. There is often associated nausea and vomiting. Testis may be higher than its normal position. Mild pyrexia and redness of overlying area may be found. Presentation of acute appendicitis includes abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Appendix becomes more swollen and inflamed, it begins to irritate the adjoining abdominal wall. Leads to the localization of the pain to the right lower quadrant. Classic migration of pain may not be seen in children under three years. Pain can be elicited through signs and can be severe. Signs include localized findings in the right iliac fossa. Abdominal wall becomes very sensitive to gentle pressure (palpation). There is severe pain on sudden release of deep pressure in the lower abdomen (rebound tenderness). If appendix is retrocecal (localized behind the cecum), even deep pressure in the right lower quadrant may fail to elicit tenderness (silent appendix). This is because the cecum, distended with gas, protects the inflamed appendix from pressure. Similarly, if the appendix lies entirely within the pelvis, there is usually complete absence of abdominal rigidity. Digital rectal examination elicits tenderness in the rectovesical pouch. Coughing causes point tenderness in this area (McBurney's point).> Acute pyelonephritis develop rapidly over a few hours or a day & it can cause high fever, pain on passing urine, and abdominal pain that radiates along the flank towards the back. There is often associated vomiting.> Chronic pyelonephritis causes persistent flank or abdominal pain, signs of infection (fever, unintentional weight loss, malaise, decreased appetite), lower urinary tract symptoms and blood in the urine.> Diverticulitis symptoms may include: Tenderness, cramps, or pain in the abdomen (usually in the lower left side but may occur on the right) that is sometimes worse with movement.

In a \"normal\" adult, this is the equivalent of 10-20 units. Potential complications from this include coagulopathy, citrate toxicity, hypothermia, acid-base disturbances and changes in serum potassium concentration. Coagulopathy is common with massive transfusion. The most common cause of bleeding following a large volume transfusion is dilutional thrombocytopenia. This should be suspected and treated first before moving on to factor deficiencies as the cause of coagulopathy. Patients who may require multiple transfusions are best second by receiving SPAP and leucocyte reduced components to lower the risk of autoimmunization. Citrate toxicity results when the citrate in the transfused blood begins to bind calcium in the patient's body. Clinically significant hypocalcemia does not usually occur unless the rate of transfusion exceeds one unit every five minutes or so. Citrate metabolism is primarily hepatic - so hepatic disease or dysfunction can cause this effect to be more pronounced. Treatment is with intravenous calcium administration - but identification of the problem requires a high index of suspicion. Hypothermia should not occur on a regular basis. Massive transfusion is an absolute indication for the warming of all blood and fluid to body temperature as it is being given.Acid-Base balance can be seen after massive transfusion. The most common abnormality is a metabolic alkalosis. Patients may initially be acidotic because the blood load itself is acidic and there may be a prevailing lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion. However, once normal perfusion is restored, any metabolic acidosis resolves and the citrate and lactate are then converted to bicarbonate in the liver. Serum potassium can rise as blood is given. The potassium concentration in stored blood increases steadily with time. The amount of potassium is typically less than 4 milliequivalents per unit - so you can see that large amounts of blood at a high rate of delivery is required to raise serum levels of potassium.",

An ideal suture material for abdominal closure should neither disappear nor lose its tensile strength until the wound has regained near-normal tensile strength.* Nonabsorbable, monofilament materials are found to be good.b) Method of closure* Single layer closure has lower incidence than multilayer closure* Interrupted suture is better than continuous suturec) Drainage* Drainage directly through the wound leads to a higher incidence of burst than employing drainage through a separate (stab) incision.d) Incision* Midline & vertical incisions are more prone to burst than transverse incisionse) Reason for initial operation* Deep wound infection is prone to cause burst abdomen* Operations on pancreas with leakage of enzymes favours dehiscencef) Wound complication* Hematoma, infectiong) Increased intraabdominal pressure* Ascites, distended bowel, coughing, vomitingh) General condition of the patient* Obesity, jaundice, malignant disease, hypoproteinemia and anemia predispose burst abdomen.",

Usual clinical manifestation results from wide-mouth diverticulum measuring approximately 5 cm in length with a diameter up to 2 cm. Lining cells are commonly similar to gastric mucosal cells (50% of all Meckle's diverticulum). Pancreatic mucosa is encountered in approximately 5% diverticula and less commonly harbor colonic mucosa. Most common clinical presentation of Meckle's diverticulitis is gastrointestinal bleeding. Other symptoms may be of intestinal obstruction, intussusception or rarely incarceration of the diverticulum in an inguinal hernia (Littre's hernia). Single most accurate diagnostic test for Meckle's diverticulum is scintigraphy with sodium 99mTc-pertechnetate. Plain abdominal radiograph, CT, Ultrasonography are rarely helpful.

Carbon dioxide 8c N2O are now preferred gas because of increased risk of air embolism with room air.* CO2 is used for insufflation as it is 200 times more diffusible than O2, is rapidly cleared from the body by the lungs and will not support combustion.* N2O is only 68% as rapidly absorbed in blood as CO2. N2O has one advantage over CO2 that it has mild analgesic effect, and so causing no pain if diagnostic laparoscopy is performed under local anaesthesia. For short operative procedures like sterilization or drilling, under local anaesthetic N2O may also be used. During prolonged laparoscopic procedure N2O should not be a preferred gas for pneumoperitoneum because it supports combustion better than air.* CO2 when come in contact with peritoneal fluid converts into carbonic acid. Carbonic acid irritates diaphragm causing shoulder tip pain & discomfort in abdomen. Carbonic acid has one advantage also that it alters pH of peritoneal fluid (acidotic changes) and it is mild antiseptic so the chances of infection may be slightly less compared to any other gas.* Helium gas being inert in nature is also tried in many centers but it does not have any added benefit over CO2.",
