(a) AscitesRef: Bailey & Love 26th ed. / 980* A peritoneo-venous shunt (also called Denver shunt) is a shunt which drains peritoneal fluid from the peritoneum into veins, usually the internal jugular vein or the superiorvena cava.* It is sometimes used in patients with refractory ascites.* It is a long tube with a non-return valve running subcutaneously from the peritoneum to the internal jugular vein in the neck, which flows ascitic fluid to pass directly into the systemic circulation.",
