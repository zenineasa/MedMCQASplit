Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)# BCC is the most common type of eyelid tumour, accounting for about 85% of all eyelid tumours. It is also the most common type of cancer that occurs outside the eyeball.# BCC of the eyelid usually affects adults, but may also occur in younger people.# These tumours are related to sun exposure and are similar to basal cell carcinoma of the skin.# BCC most often occurs in the lower eyelidb. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)# SCC of the eyelid is uncommon, accounting for about 5% of all eyelid tumours.# It can occur from a precancerous condition, such as actinic keratosis or Bowen's disease.# These tumours are also related to sun exposure and are similar to squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.# SCC tends to behave more aggressively and is more likely to spread than BCC.c. Sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC)# SGC is cancer of the glands in the eyelid.# It is a rare tumour that may account for up to 5% of all eyelid cancers.# It occurs more often in women than men and occurs most often in the elderly.# These tumours develop most often on the upper eyelid, followed by the lower eyelid and the caruncleo SGC can start in the Meibomian glands, glands of Zeis or the sebaceous glands of the caruncle.# SGC is often diagnosed at a later stage because it can mimic benign conditions. It can also grow aggressively.# SGC may be multifocal (occurring in more than one place), so they have a tendency to recur after treatmentd Malignant melanoma# Melanoma of the eyelid is very uncommon and accounts for less than 1% of all eyelid cancers.# Melanoma of the eyelid is similar to melanoma of the skin of the skin. It is staged and treated the same way as a skin melanoma.",

Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeterso Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in younger adults and children.o It is also known as universal tumourOther conditionso Lipomatosis is believed to be a hereditary condition in which multiple lipomas are present on the bodyo Adiposis dolorosa (Dercum disease) is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. Early studies mentioned prevalence in obese postmenopausal women. However, current literature demonstrates that Dercum disease is present in more women than men of all body types; the average age for diagnosis is 35 years.o Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years ofalcoholism. But, non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.Treatmento Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for histopathology to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a liposarcoma..o Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. This cures the great majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision.o Liposuction is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small connective tissuecomponent. Liposuction typically results in less scarring; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to regrowth.",
