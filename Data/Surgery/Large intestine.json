Mucocutaneous pigmentation usually occurs during infancy and most commonly noted in perioral and buccal region. Pigment spots usually appear in first few years of life, reach a maximum level in early adolescence and can fade in adulthood. However, pigmentation on the buccal mucosa remains throughout the life. The pigmented macules of PJS have no malignant potential. Screening consists of a baseline colonoscopy and upper endoscopy at age 20 years, followed by annual flexible sigmoidoscopy thereafter.",
