The two conditions vary in their symptom pattern and onset, but both involve the internal organ systems, including the renal tract and lungs (causing failure and pulmonary fibrosis). Skin involvement in DCSS is severe and widespread, but organ involvement is maximal at around 3 years and then typically improves. In CREST skin involvement is confined to the face and extremities; however, organ involvement tends to be progressive and more severe. CREST syndrome is typified by the following features: Calcinosis, Raynaud's, esophageal disorders, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia. Diagnosis is clinical and backed by identification of ceain auto-antibodies. Anti-nuclear antibodies are usually present, anti-Scl-70 is positive in 40% of scleroderma, the presence of anti-centromere antibody occurs in 80%-90% of CREST and is suggestive of the diagnosis. However, auto-antibody testing is non-specific, and either antibody or both antibodies may occur in both conditions.",
