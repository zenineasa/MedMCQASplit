If it begins to rise again, tumor recurrence is likely. AFP, or alpha-fetoprotein, is an alpha globulin (70,000 daltons) made by the liver and yolk sac of the human fetus. It is elevated with hepatocellular carcinoma and germ cell neoplasms. It is not paicularly specific. hCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, is a glycoprotein secreted by trophoblastic epithelium of the placenta. It is useful (sensitive and specific) for germ cell tumors of the testis and ovary. LDH, or lactate dehydrogenase, is a very non-specific test that can be elevated in many conditions, including malignancy. Ref: Meric-Bernstam F., Pollock R.E. (2010). Chapter 10. Oncology. In F.C.

Metastases to hand and foot bones are uncommon and, if present, the source is usually a lung, colon, or renal neoplasm. Ref: Srinivasan R.C., Tolhurst S., Vanderhave K.L. (2010). Chapter 40.

Treatment options include surgery or putting the finger in a Mallet splint for 6 to 8 weeks or extension block k-wire for 4 weeks. The splint allows the tendon to return to normal length, if the finger is bent during these weeks the healing process must sta all over again.

They include the aspaate aminotransferase (AST) and the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) There is a poor correlation between the degree of liver cell damage and the level of the aminotransferases. Thus, the absolute elevation of the aminotransferases is of no prognostic significance in acute hepatocellular disorders. Alanine aminotransferase: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was formerly known as SGPT. This enzyme enters the blood when liver cells are damaged or destroyed and circulates for a few days. ALT is found primarily in the liver. (More specific for liver pathology) This enzyme is a sensitive indicator of active liver damage but does not indicate the cause or reversibility of the damage. An increase of at least three times normal indicates significant liver damage within the previous 2 to 5 days. Aspaate aminotransferase: Aspaate transaminase (AST), also called as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). AST is found in the liver, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, pancreas, lungs, leukocytes, and erythrocytes in decreasing order of concentration. Alpha Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Increased GST indicates early hepatocyte injury. Alpha glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a superior marker of hepatocyte injury from toxicity; ischemia, and other liver injury. It is unique to hepatocytes, found in high concentrations, and is readily released in response to injury. Its rapid release into and removal from the circulation provides immediate information regarding liver status.",

No fuher t/t is needed. Simple cholecystectomy is sufficient for them. - In laparoscopic cholecystectomy, recurrent cancer has been seen at the po site. Hence all po sites should be excised. - Patients with preoperatively suspected gallbladder cancer should under go open cholecystectomy to minimize the chances of tumor dissemination. Tlb staged tumors (tumors invading muscular layer)? - Invasion of the muscular layer allows access to lymphatics and vessels. For Tlb staged tumors, an extended cholecystectomy is indicated, as these tumors have been repoed to recur after simple cholecystectomy. For stage lb, II, selected stage III tumors: These are managed by extended cholecystectomy. Stage IV tumors: - Should be treated with appropriate palliation as indicated. No randomized data have demonstrated improved survival with either chemotherapy or radiation and its use depends on case to case basis. Treatment after incidental finding of gallbladder cancer: Treatment after incidental finding of gallbladder cancer on pathologic review: For T1a tumors (tumor invades lamina propria) - Observation only is open cholecystectomy done. - Excision of all po sites if cholecystectomy done laparoscopically. For Tlb tumors (tumor invades muscle layer) or greater - A radical re-resection (after a complete staging including laparoscopy demonstrating resectability) is highly recommended Treatment after incidental finding of gallbladder cancer at surgery: After incidental finding of gallbladder cancer at surgery staging has to be performed intraoperatively and extended cholecystectomy including en bloc hepatic resection and lymphadenectomy with or without bile duct excision has to be considered depending on resectability and expeise of the surgeon",

LES comprises the lower 4 cm of esophagus, where resting pressure within the lumen normally exceeds the intragastric pressure. This high intraluminal pressure at LES prevents the GE reflux. The LES is a physiological entity rather than any anatomical structure Several factors contribute to the high intraluminal pressure of LES a) Intrinsic musculature of distal esophagus - these muscle fibres differ from those in other areas of the esophagus in that they are in a state of tonic contraction. They normally relax with initiation of a swallow and then return to a state of tonic contraction. b) Sling fibres of the cardia c) Crura of the diaphragm d) Intraabdominal pressure - the intraabdominal pressure compresses the intraabdominal segment of esophagus (ie LES) and is probably the most impoant factor in preventing the reflux. CSDT writes - \"Sphincter competance is a function of sphincter pressure, sphincter length and the length exposed to intraabdominal pressure\". In cases of sliding hernia the gastroesophageal junction shifts to posterior mediastinum. The LES is then exposed to the low intrathoracic pressure instead of the high intraabdominal pressure. The low intrathoracic pressure is unable to prevent the reflux in sliding hernia. Other factors apa from LES which prevent the reflux a) The gastroesophageal angle - the oblique entry of esophagus has a valvular effect, in that it closes the esophagus when the gastric fundus distends b) The folds of mucosa at the cardia helps in closing the LES when intragastric pressure rises. c) The intrathoracic pressure has no role in preventing reflux.

The heat generated is propoional to the resistance to the flow of current. Bone, fat, and tendons offer the greatest resistance. Therefore, the tissue deep within the center of an extremity may be injured while more superficial tissues are spared. For this reason, the quantification of fluid requirements cannot be based on the percentage of body surface area involved, as in the Parkland,Brooke, or Baxter formulas, which are used to calculate fluid replacement after thermal burns. Massive fluid replacement is usually essential. A brisk urine output is desirable because of the likelihood of myonecrosis with consequent myoglobinuria and renal damage. As with deep thermal burns, debridement, skin grafting, and amputation of extremities may be required following electrical injury. However, fasciotomy is more frequently required than escharotomy with electrical injury because deep myonecrosis results in increased intracompamental pressures and compromised limb perfusion. In addition, distant fractures may result owing to vigorous muscle contraction during the accident or if subsequent falls occur. Cardiac or respiratory arrest may occur if the pathway of the current includes the hea or brain. An electrical current can also damage the pulmonary alveoli and capillaries and lead to respiratory infections, a major cause of death in these victims. Owing to the deep myonecrosis that often accompanies high-voltage injury, prophylaxis for clostridia with high-dose penicillin may be considered.",

        "exp": "Ans is 'b' i.e. CD 117 Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the GI tract and are most frequently located in the stomach (60%-70%). In 1983, Mazur and Clark coined the term GIST to indicate a distinctive subgroup of GI mesenchymal tumor, which could be classified neither as neurogenic nor as smooth muscle derived tumor. Historically, they were presumed to have smooth muscle origin and classified as leiomyomas, leiomyoblastomas, and leiomyosarcoma. They are considered to originated from the interstitial cell of Cajal, an intestinal pacemaker cells. Almost all GISTs (and almost no smooth muscle tumors) express c-KIT (CD117) or the related PDGFRA, as well as CD34. Kit is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, the ligand for which is stem cell factor. The Kit protein is detected by immunohistochemistry and can reliably distinguish GISTs from true smooth muscle neoplasms. (Note that almost all smooth muscle tumors (and almost no GISTs) express actin and desmin. KIT is used not only for diagnosis but also for targeted therapy of GISTs. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is widely used in the treatment of advanced and metastatic GISTs and has been recently employed in the neo adjuvant and adjuvant set-up with encouraging results. Surgical resection of the localized GIST is the mainstay therapy, as a resection of tumor renders only a chance of cure. The primary goal of surgery is complete resection of the disease with negative margins. GISTs are resistant to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore until the advent of Imatinib, there was no effective treatment available for the unresectable or metastatic GISTs. The development of Imatinib mesylate has revolutionized the management of this disease. Imatinib mesylate (formerly referred to as STI 571, GleevecTM) is a 2-phenylpyrimidine derivative that blocks binding of ATP to ABL tyrosine kinases including c-Kit, c-ABL, bcr-ABL, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRA). Imatinib was developed as a PDGFR inhibitor. The efficacy of Imatinib mesylate as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor was first assessed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is associated with mutation in bcrABL tyrosine kinase similar to the role of KIT in GIST. Prognosis in patients with GIST tumors depends mostly on tumor size and mitotic count, and metastasis. GISTs metastasize through hematogenous route. Usual sites are infra-abdominal, either to the liver, omentum, or peritoneal cavity. (Ref: Devita's Oncology 8/e).",

Secondary grade is assigned to the second most commonly observed pattern in the specimen. Gleason score is the sum of the two grades. Thus it is also known as Gleason sum.

Sprains constitute 85% of all ankle injuries, and 85% of those involve a lateral inversion mechanism. Inversion Sprain - Inversion ankle sprains occur when the foot turns in or out to an abnormal degree relative to the ankle. The most common mechanism of an ankle sprain is a combination of plantarflexion and inversion where the foot is pointing downward and inward. The lateral ligaments are involved in an inversion ankle sprain and hence most commonly damaged. These ligaments are on the outside of the ankle, which includes the anterior talofibular (ATFL), calcaneofibular (CFL) and posterior talofibular ligaments (PTFL). Injury to the ATFL is the most common. When both the ATFL and CFL are injured together, ankle instability will be more noticeable.

Gallstones that travel down the common bile duct and which subsequently get stuck in the Ampulla of Vater can cause obstruction in the outflow of pancreatic juices from the pancreas into the duodenum. The backflow of these digestive juices causes lysis (dissolving) of pancreatic cells and subsequent pancreatitis. E - ethanol (alcohol) T - trauma S - steroids M - mumps (paramyxovirus) and other viruses (Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus) A - autoimmune disease (Polyaeritis nodosa, Systemic lupus erythematosus) S - scorpion sting (e.g. Tityus trinitatis), and also snake bites H - hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia/hyperiglyceridemia and hypothermia E - ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography) D - drugs (SAND - steroids and sulfonamides, azathioprine, NSAIDS, diuretics such as furosemide and thiazides, and didanosine) and duodenal ulcers. This mnemonic is also roughly arranged according to the frequency of its causes. Thus: Gallstone pancreatitis is more common than pancreatitis caused by alcohol, trauma, or steroids.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Involucrum is dead bone Pathology in chronic osteomyelitis Chronic osteomyelitis occurs most commonly in long bones. Bone is destroyed or devitalized in the affected pa. Cavities containing pus and pieces of dead bone (sequestra) are surrounded by vascular tissue, and beyond that by areas of sclerosis due to reaction new bone formation, which may take the form of a distinct bony sheath (involucrum) Often sinus track leads to the skin surface; the sinus tends to heal and present down recurrently, but if a sequestrum is present it never heals permanently. This is because sequestra act as substrate for bacterial adhesion in much the same way as foreign implants, ensuring the persistence of infection until they are removed or discharged through perforations in the involucrum and sinuses that drain to the skin. Sequestrum Sequestrum is apiece of dead bone, surrounded by infected granulation tissue trying to eat the sequestrum away. The sequestrum is hard, rough, porus, light in weight and lighter in colour than normal. Normal pattern of bone is lost.(Note : Sequestrum in syphilis and TB is heavier than normal bone because sclerosis usually precedes the death of the bone). On x-ray, sequestra show up as unnatural dense fragments, in contrast to the surrounding osteopenic bone. Involucrum Involucrum is reactive new bone overlying a sequestrum. There may be some holes in the involucrum for pus to drain out. These holes are called cloaca.",

        "question": "Features of hypehyroidism are all except: March 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Cold intolerance Causes Functional thyroid tissue producing an excess of thyroid hormone occurs in a number of clinical conditions. The major causes are: - Graves' disease (the most common etiology with 70-80%) - Toxic thyroid adenoma - Toxic multinodular goitre High blood levels of thyroid hormones/hypehyroxinemia can occur for a number of other reasons: - Inflammation of the thyroid is called thyroiditis. There are a number of different kind of thyroiditis including Hashimoto's (immune mediated), subacute (inflammatory), and DeQuervain's (granulomatous). These may be initially associated with secretion of excess thyroid hormone, but usually progress to gland dysfunction and thus, to hormone deficiency and hypothyroidism. - Struma ovarii (a teratoma of the ovary) can produce excess thyroid hormone. - Amiodarone, a hea medication, can sometimes cause hypehyroidism. - Postpaum thyroiditis (PPT) occurs in about 7% of women. Major clinical signs include weight loss (often accompanied by a increased appetite), anxiety, intolerance to heat, fatigue, hair loss, weakness, hyperactivity, irritability, apathy, depression, polyuria, polydipsia, and sweating. Additionally, patients may present with a variety of symptoms such as palpitations and arrhythmias (notably atrial fibrillation), shoness of breath (dyspnea), loss of libido, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Long term untreated hypehyroidism can lead to osteoporosis Neurological manifestations can include tremor, chorea, myopathy, and in some susceptible individuals (paicularly of asian descent) periodic paralysis. Minor ocular (eye) signs, which may be present in any type of hypehyroidism, are eyelid retraction (\"stare\") and lid-lag. In hypehyroid stare (Dalrymple sign) the eyelids are retracted upward more than normal (the normal position is at the superior corneoscleral limbus, where the \"white\" of the eye begins at the upper border of the iris). In lid-lag (von Graefe's sign), when the patient tracks an object downward with their eyes, the eyelid fails to follow the downward moving iris, and the same type of upper globe exposure which is seen with lid retraction occurs, temporarily. These signs disappear with treatment of the hypehyroidism. Neither of these ocular signs should be confused with exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeball) which occurs specifically and uniquely in Graves' disease. This forward protrusion of the eyes is due to immune mediated inflammation in the retroorbital (eye socket) fat. Measuring the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the blood is usually all that is required. A low TSH indicates that the pituitary gland is being inhibited by increased levels of T4 and/or T3 in the blood, and is therefore a reliable marker of hypehyroidism. Measuring specific antibodies, such as anti-TSH-receptor antibodies in Graves' disease, or anti-thyroid-peroxidase in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, may also contribute to the diagnosis. Thyroid scintigraphy is a useful test to distinguish between causes of hypehyroidism, and this entity from thyroiditis.",

Then a mixture of dead space air plus alveolar air comes out.

The CO2 concentration in the last 10m1. of tidal volume is known as end tidal CO2 In pulmonary embolism the blood supply to ceain pas of the lung is cut off due to the emboli in circulation. This reduces the exchange of gases between the alveoli and pulmonary capillaries, as a result the conc. of CO2 in alveolar air decreases (CO2 is carried from tissues to the lung by blood and is transferred to the alveoli in exchange of 02). The decrease in alveolar CO2 will lead to decrease in end tidal CO2. Other conditions in which end tidal CO decreases (i) Increase in dead space (decrease in end tidal CO2 in pulmonary embolism can be explained by this also.

Saline cannot be used because electrolytes in the irrigation fluid will dissipate the electric current used to resect the prostate.\" - Schwaz 8/e p1530 (not given in 9/e) During transurethral resection of prostate strips of tissue are cut from the bladder neck down to the level of veru mon tan um. This cutting is performed by a loop mounted on the hand held trigger of the resectoscope in which Diathermy current is being passed. We all know that normal saline is a very good conductor of electricity (as it contain ions - Na+ & CI ions). So if it is used while performing TURF, the diathermy current used in the procedure will cause electrolyte diassociation of normal saline and the current will not be localized in the loop and hence cutting of the tissue will not be proper. You can put up a question that the same can occur with the use of distilled water too. Distilled water can also conduct electricity-but the current used during TURP is not very strong and distilled water is not as good conductor of electricity as Normal saline.

        "exp": "Bronchiolitis obliterans Bronchiolitis obliterans is a rare chronic lung disease of the bronchioles and smaller airways. Bronchiolitis obliterans most commonly occurs in pediatric population after respiratory infections (i.e. adenovirus, mycoplasma, measles, influenza, and peussis). Other causes include connective tissue disease (i.e. juvenile rheumatoid ahritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, and scleroderma) Bronchiolitis occurs in all age groups. Pathogenesis After the initial insult, inflammation affecting terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts may result in obliteration of the airway lumen. Epithelial damage resulting in abnormal repair is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans. Complete or paial obstruction of the airway lumen may result in air trapping or atelactasis. Clinical manifestations Cough, fever, cyanosis and respiratory distress followed by initial improvement may be the initial signs of bronchiolitis obliterans. Progression of the disease may ensue with increasing dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and wheezing. Chest radiographs may be relatively normal compared with the extent of physical findings but may demonstrate hyperluscency and patchy infiltrates (occasionally, a sayer James syndrome, i.e. a unilateral hyperluscent lung has developed). Pulmonary function tests demonstrate variable findings but typically show signs of airway obstruction. Ventilation perfusion scan shows a typical motheaten appearance of multiple matched defects in ventilation and perfusion. CT scan demonstrates patchy areas of hyperluscency. Open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy remains the best means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment No definite therapy exists for bronchiolitis obliterans. Administration of coicosteroids may be beneficial About other options Follicular bronchitis It is a lymphoproliferative lung disorder characterized the presence of lymphoid follicles, coursing along the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) It is rare in children. Although the cause is unknown, an infectious aetiology has been proposed. Onset of symptoms generally occurs by 6 weeks of age and peaks between 6 and 18 months. Cough, moderate fever and fine crackles are common clinical findings. Fine crackles generally, persist over time and recurrence of symptoms is common. Chest radiographs may be relatively benign initially but evolve into the typical interstitial pattern. Pulmonary function tests show restrictive pattern Chest CT shows fine reticular pattern. Open lung biopsy is used to make definitive diagnosis. Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis This is a rare disorder. Although the underlying cause of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is unknown, the disease is characterized by the formation of lamellar concretions of calcium phosphate or \"microlith\". within the alveoli, creating a classic pattern on the radiograph. Chest radiography typically reveal bilateral infiltrates with afine sandlike micronodular appearance. Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is in the mid 30s the onset of the disease can occur during childhood. When symptomatic, individuals with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis usually complain of dyspnoea on exeion and non productive cough. Physical examinations of the lungs may reveal fine inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds. Clubbing occurs, although this is usually a more advanced sign. Children are often asymptomatic on initial presentation. Diagnosis Chest radiography typically reveals b/L infiltrate with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance or \"Sandstorm\" appearance. CT scan shows diffuse micronodular calcified densities. Open lung biopsy reveals laminated calcific ioncretions within the alceoli.",

        "question": "All of the following are features of Grave's disease except: September 2005",
        "exp": "Ans. A: More common in males Graves disease, a syndrome of primary thyrotoxicosis, is caused by circulating thyroid receptor autoantibodies (TRab/ TSH-RAbs). The antibodies not only displace thyrotropin from the thyroid receptors but also mimic thyrotropin by activating the receptor to stimulate the synthesis and release T3 and T4. Because autoantibody production is not linked to the normal pituitary negative feedback loop, thyroid gland function becomes autonomous, and serum T4 and T3 levels become abnormally high and lead to clinical thyrotoxicosis. Because hormone synthesis is accelerated and thyroid gland radioiodine uptake is elevated, radionuclide scans demonstrate a diffuse increase in iodine uptake by the gland. Graves disease is closely associated with Hashimoto's disease (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) in which thyrotoxic/ cytotoxic antithyroid antibodies attack the gland. Thyrotoxicosis is eight times more common in females. Major clinical signs include weight loss (often accompanied by a increased appetite), anxiety, intolerance to heat, fatigue, hair loss, weakness, hyperactivity, irritability, apathy, depression, polyuria, polydipsia, and sweating. Additionally, patients may present with a variety of symptoms such as palpitations and arrhythmias (notably atrial fibrillation), shoness of breath (dyspnea), loss of libido, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Long term untreated hypehyroidism can lead to osteoporosis Neurological manifestations can include tremor, chorea, myopathy, and in some susceptible individuals (paicularly of asian descent) periodic paralysis. The goiter in primary thyrotoxicosis is diffuse and vascular; it may be large or small, firm or soft, and a thrill and a bruit may be present. The onset is abrupt but remissions and exacerbations are not infrequent. Hypehyroidism is usually more severe than in secondary thyrotoxicosis but cardiac failure is rare. Manifestations of thyrotoxicosis not due to hypehyroidism per se, for example orbital proptosis, ophthalmoplegia and pretibial myxoedema, may occur in primary thyrotoxicosis. Thyroid dermopathy/ pretibial myxoedema is characterized by thickening of the skin, usually in areas of trauma, by deposition of hyaluronic acid in the dermis and subcutis.",

A: Umbilicus Sister Mary Joseph nodule/node/ Sister Mary Joseph sign, refers to a palpable nodule bulging into the umbilicus as a result of metastasis of a malignant cancer in the pelvis or abdomen. Gastrointestinal malignancies account for about half of underlying sources (most commonly gastric cancer, colonic cancer or pancreatic cancer, mostly of the tail and body of the pancreas), and men are even more likely to have an underlying cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. Gynecological cancers account for about 1 in 4 cases (primarily ovarian cancer and also uterine cancer). Unknown primary tumors and rarely, urinary or respiratory tract malignancies cause umbilical metastases. Proposed mechanisms for the spread of cancer cells to the umbilicus include direct transperitoneal spread, the lymphatics which run alongside the obliterated umbilical vein, hematogenous spread, or remnant structures such as the falciform ligament, median umbilical ligament, or a remnant of the vitelline duct. Sister Joseph nodule is associated with multiple peritoneal metastases and a poor prognosis. Virchow's node (or signal node) is an enlarged, hard, left supraclavicular lymph node which can contain metastasis of visceral (abdominal) malignancy.",

In a recent study it has been repoed that 69% of compament syndromes are associated with fracturesQ and 36% of all compament syndrome are associated with tibial diaphyseal fractureQ. With the improved results associated with intramedullary nailing of tibial fractures, compament syndrome has become the commonest serious complication of closed tibial fractures. An open fracture does not protect the patient from compament syndrome. It mainly affects young male and is best detected by compament pressure monitoringQ. Most of the classical symptoms of compament syndrome only occur only after there has been irreversible soft tissue damageQ. If the surgeons wait for paresthesia, paralysis, or pulselessness, the patient is highly unlikely to recover full function and it is probable that myonecrosis will already have staed. If clinical suspicion is to be used for diagnosis, the diagnosis must be based on increased painQ (dispropoionate) and pain on passive muscle stretchQ, as these clinical signs usually occur at an earlier stage. It is extremely difficult to diagnose compament syndrome clinically, and this problem is exacerbated by the fact that a number of patients will be pain free, unconscious, on ventilators, or anesthetized when compament syndrome becomes clinically impoant. When monitoring it is only necessary to record the pressure in the anterior compament (as it is involved in all cases). The pressure is highest nearer the fracture site, it is there fore impoant to locate the tip of the catheter near to the fracture site to ensure that the muscle with the highest pressure is monitored. Continuous pressure monitoring is better than single reading. Surgeons use a single pressure level, usually 30 mm He, or a difference between intra compament pressure and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic BP - ICP) < 30 mmHgQ as an appropriate criteria to base the decision to undeake fasciotomy. Subtotal fasciotomy should never be undeaken. All four compaments should be decompressed.

Increasing the permeability of the membrane to potassium or decreasing the extracellular potassium concentration increases the flow of potassium out of the cell. Altering the activity of the sodium-potassium pump or the extracellular sodium concentration has no immediate effect on the flow of potassium across the membrane.

        "exp": "Furosemide Initial therapy of severe hypercalcemia includes the simultaneous administration of saline, calcitonin and a biphosphonate. Isotonic saline Isotonic saline corrects possible volume depletion due to hypercal- cemia induced urinary salt wasting and in some cases vomiting. Hypovolemia exacerbates hypercalcemia by impairing the renal clearance of calcium. - The rate of saline infusion depends upon several factors including the severity of hypercalcemia, the age of the patient and the presence of comorhid conditions paicularly underlying cardiac or renal disease. - A reasonable regimen in the absence of edema is the administration of isotonic saline at an initial rate of 200-300 ml/h that is then adjusted to maintain the urine output at 100-150 ml/h, - Saline therapy requires careful monitoring since it can lead to fluid overload in patients who cannot excrete the administered salt because of impaired renal function which can be induced by hypercalcemia or hea failure. - The saline infusion should be stopped in patients who develop edema and a loop diuretic may be necessary. Saline therapy rarely normalizes the serum calcium concentration in patients with more than mild hypercalcemia. Saline therapy beyond that necessary to restore euvolemia has fallen out of our for two reasons: - The availability of drugs such as biphosphonates and calcitonin that inhibit bone resorption which is primarily responsible .for hypercalcemia. - The requirement for careful monitoring because of potential fluid and electrolyte complications resulting .from a massive saline infusion and furosemide induced diuresis such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and volume depletion if the diuretic induced losses are not replaced. Furosemide in hypercalcemia In the past administration of loop diuretic was initiated routinely once fluid repletion had been achieved to fuher increase urinary calcium excretion. - However this practice was based upon an approach that involved intensive administration of furosemide (80-100 mg every one to two hours) with aggressive fluid hydration. - In the patients with hypercalcemia receiving saline hydration, routinely using a loop diuretic is not suggested. However in individuals with renal insufficiency or hea failure, careful monitoring and judicious use of loop diuretics may be required to prevent. fluid overload. - In the absence of renal failure or hea failure, loop diuretic therapy to directly increase calcium excretion is not recommended because of potential complications and the availability of drugs that inhibit bone resorption. William's Endocrinology on I.V. furosemide in hypercalcemia Use of furosemide or other potent loop diuretics to promote calciuresis can exacerbate extracellular volume depletion if used too early in the course of treatment. In the light of availability of highly effective alternatives for the therapy of hypercalcemia such drugs probably are best avoided except in circumstances in which rigorous hydration fails to improve severe hypercalcemia or might ppt precipitase C.H. F.. In any case prolonged use of saline induced dieresis without early introduction of an effective antiresorptive agent is ill advised and ultimately futile. Concurrent treatment with biphosphonates with or without calcitonin is typically required to treat moderate to severe hypercalcemia. Calcitonin Pharmacological doses of serum calcitonin reduce the serum calcium concentration by increasing renal calcium excretion and, more impoantly by decreasing bone resorption interference with osteoclast maturation. - Calcitonin is relatively safe and nontoxic although a relatively weak agent, it works rapidly, lowering the serum calciwn concentration by maximum of 1-2 mg/dl beginning within, four to six hours. Thus it is useful in combination with hydration .for the initial management of severe hypercalcemia. The efficacy of calcitonin is limited to the first 48 hours even with repeated doses, indicating the development of tachyphylaxis, perhaps due to receptor downregulation. - Because of its limited duration of effect, calcitonin is most beneficial in symptomatic patients with calcium >14 mg/L when combined with hydration and biphosphonates. Calcitonin and hydration provide a rapid reduction in serum calcium concentration while a biphosphonate provides a more sustained effo. Biphosphonates - The biphosphonates are nonhydrolyzable analogues of inorganic pyrophosphate that adsorb to the surface of bone hydroxyapatite and inhibits calcium release by interfering with osteoclast mediated bone resorption. They are effective in treating the hypercalcemia resulting ,from excess of any cause. All of the biphosphonates are relatively nontoxic compounds and they are more potent than calcitonin and saline .for patients with moderate or severe hypercalcemia. As a result, they have became the preferred agents for management of hypercalcemia due to excessive bone resorption from a variety of causes. -Their maximum effifct occurs in two to four days so that they are usually given in conjunction with saline / calcitonin which reduce serum calcium concentration more rapidly. Biphosphonates in renal impairment \"Biphosphonates have potential nephrotoxicity. But this does not mean that they are completely avoided in patients with renal failure\" In clinical trials of zolindronate for the treatment of hypercalcemia, patients with serum creatinine concentration as high as 4.5 mg/d1 were eligibile for paicipation. In addition there are case repos of successful use of ibandronate and pamidronate in patients with renal failure and multiple myeloma, renal insufficiency (creatinine 2 1.5 mg/dl) and in hemodialysis patients with severe hypercalcemia. - However caution is suggested when using intravenous to treat hypercalcemia in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine > 4.5 mg/dl). - Adequate hydration with saline and t/t with a reduced dosage and/or slower infusion rate (4 mg Z4 over 30-60 minutes, 30-45 mg pamidronate over 4 hours, 2 mg ibandronate over one hour / ?nay minimize risk). Dialysis -Hemodialysis with little or no calcium in the dialysis fluid and peritoneal dialysis (though it is slower) are both effective therapies for hypercalcemia and are considered tit of last reso. - Dialysis may be indicated in patients with severe malignancy associated hypercalcemia and renal insufficiency or hea, failure, in whom hydration cannot be safely administered. - The use of hypercalcemia in patients with without renal failure may require alterations in the composition of conventional dialysis solutions in order to avoid an exacerbation or induction of other metabolic abnormalities, paicularly hypophosphatemia.",

The lower thoracic and upper lumbar veebrae are the areas of the spine most often affected. Pott's disease results from haematogenous spread of tuberculosis from other sites, often pulmonary. The infection then spreads from two adjacent veebrae into the adjoining disc space. If only one veebra is affected, the disc is normal, but if two are involved the interveebral disc, which is avascular, cannot receive nutrients and collapses (seen as narrowing of interveebral space on X-rays) The disease progresses slowly. Signs and symptoms include: Localised back pain is the earliest and commonest complaint Paraveebral swelling may be seen Neurological signs may occur, leading to paraplegia. Stiffness Deformity Constitutional symptoms Spinal X-ray may not show early disease as 50% of bone mass must be lost for changes to be visible on x-ray. However, plain radiographs can show veebral destruction and narrowed disc space. MRI is useful to demonstrate the extent of spinal compression and can show changes at an earlier stage than plain radiographs. Bone elements visible within the swelling, or abscesses, are strongly indicative of Pott's disease as opposed to malignancy. CT scans and nuclear bone scans can also be used.",

Pancreatic injuries are usually associated with injury to other visceral organ. Isolated pancreatic injuries are rare. In blunt injuries which are usually the result of midline upper abdominal trauma (eg. car seat belt, cycle handle), junction of the neck and body of the pancreas are most commonly injured as they are pressed against the veebral column. Major abdominal vascular injuries are present in more than 75% of cases of penetrating trauma. \"The presence of pancreatic duct injury appears to be a key factor in postoperative morbidity.\" - Sabiston Also know Serum amylase levels are elevated in most patients with significant pancreatic trauma, but they are also increased in up to 90% of severe abdominal trauma patients who do not have pancreatic injury. Thus measurement of amylase at the time of hospital admission is not helpful in identifying those with pancreatic injury. On the other hand a progressive rise in serum amylase activity is a more specific indicator of pancreatic injury. Treatment The treatment of pancreatic injury depends on its grade and extent. - Minor injuries not involving a major duct may be treated nonoperatively.

During this latter period, the fetus is most vulnerable to defects in the migration of neural crest cells. This may explain why most cases of aganglionosis involve the rectum and rectosigmoid.\nThe length of the aganglionic segment of bowel is therefore determined by the most distal region that the migrating neural crest cells reach.

D: HypeoniaThe history in patients with rickets may include the following:Generalized muscular hypotonia of an unknown mechanism is observed in most patients with clinical (as opposed to biochemical and radiographic) signs of rickets.Craniotabes manifests early in infants with vitamin D deficiency, although this feature may be normal in infants, especially for those born prematurely.If rickets occurs at a later age, thickening of the skull develops. This produces frontal bossing and delays the closure of the anterior fontanelle.In the long bones, laying down of uncalcified osteoid at the metaphases leads to spreading of those areas, producing knobby deformity, which is visualized on radiography as cupping and flaring of the metaphyses.Weight bearing produces deformities such as bowlegs and knock-knees.In the chest, knobby deformities results in the rachitic rosary along the costochondral junctions. The weakened ribs pulled by muscles also produce flaring over the diaphragm, which is known as Harrison groove. The sternum may be pulled into a pigeon-breast deformity.In more severe instances in children older than 2 years, veebral softening leads to kyphoscoliosis. The ends of the long bones demonstrate that same knobby thickening. At the ankle, palpation of the tibial malleolus gives the impression of a double epiphysis (Marfan sign). Because the softened long bones may bend, they may fracture one side of the coex (i.e., greenstick fracture).",

It is the result of an increased body pool of urate with hyperuricemia. It is typically characterized by episodic acute and chronic ahritis, due to deposition of Monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joints and connective tissue tophi, and the risk for deposition in kidney interstitium or uric acid nephrolithiasis. If the clinical appearance strongly suggests gout, the diagnosis should be confirmed by needle aspiration of acutely or chronically involved joints or tophaceous deposits. Acute septic ahritis, several of the other crystalline-associated ahropathies, palindromic rheumatism, and psoriatic ahritis may present with similar clinical features. During acute gouty attacks, strongly birefringent needle-shaped MSU crystals with negative elongation are typically seen both intracellularly and extracellularly.

The morphologic features of lobular carcinoma differ from those of ductal carcinoma. ILC is characterized by small, round cells that are bland in appearance and have scant cytoplasm, which infiltrate the stroma in single file and surround benign breast tissues in a targeted manner. Infiltration typically does not destroy anatomic structures or incite a substantial connective tissue response. By viue of their distinctive growth pattern and biology, lobular carcinomas often fail to form distinct masses that can easily be diagnosed by palpation or mammography. This can make early diagnosis challenging and breast conservation approaches more difficult. Lobular carcinomas may have a substantially increased propensity for multifocal and multicentric distribution and for bilaterality.",

Resistance can manifest itself in many different ways, including withholding impoant thoughts from the analyst, falling silent during sessions, forgetting appointments, forgetting to pay the analyst, falling asleep during session, and considering dropping out of treatment. The possible manifestations of resistance are countless and depend on the patient's defense mechanisms and personality. In other words, the patient's intrapsychic defenses manifest as resistance in the context of his or her interpersonal relationship with the analyst. Freud thought that resistance should be uncovered by the analyst but not challenged or interpreted. Modern analysts believe that resistance should be analyzed through the patient's free associations suppoed by the analyst's observations.",

Activity of I a hydroxylase enzyme is under negative feedback control in normal tissues. - However, in granulomatous disorder normal feed hack inhibition is abolished, probably by the effects of interferon gamma. - Interferon gamma induces the activity of la hydroxylase this leads to increased production of calcitriol (1,25 hydroxyvitamin D). - Increased production of calcitriol causes augumented intestinal absorption of calcium. Hypersensitivity to vitamin D remains despite b/I nephrectomy indicating that increase in serum calcitriol is not mediated by renal I a hydroxylase.",

For benign biliary diseases, standard CT is not that useful an investigation. It is paicularly useful in staging of cancers of liver, gall bladder, bile ducts and pancreas. A Hepatobiliary Iminodiacetic Acid Scan, (HIDA scan)/cholescintigraphy is a radiology imaging procedure to evaluate the health and function of the gall bladder. The radioactive tracer is injected through any accessible vein,then allowed to circulate to the liver, where it is excreted into the biliary system and stored by the gallbladder and biliary system. If the gall bladder is not visualized within 4 hours after the injection, this indicates cystic duct obstruction.",

They are locally aggressive tumors & when they metastasize, it is through a hematogenous route. Palpable axillary lymphadenitis is uncommon and when encountered usually represents reactive lymph nodes univolved by metastatic disease. A clinically negative axilla in presence of large tumors may be indicative of breast sarcoma. Tumor is well circumscribed or encapsulated. Simple mastectomy is gold standard of treatment.

These tumors may arise sporadically or be inherited as features of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. The \"rule of tens\" for pheochromocytomas states that about 10% are bilateral, 10% are extraadrenal, and 10% are malignant. However, these percentages are higher in the inherited syndromes.

Abdominal Aoic Aneurysms Abdominal aoic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common true aerial aneurysm. An aoic aneurysm is defined as a focal dilation of the aoa with a diameter of at least 1.5 times that of the expected normal diameter of that given aoic segment; in the AA, enlargement of the aoic diameter of more than 3 cm is usually considered aneurysmal. Most common site is infrarenal. More common in males than females. Incidence increases with age. At least 90% of all abdominal aoic aneurysms >4.0 cm are related to atherosclerotic disease. Prognosis is related to both the size of the aneurysm and the severity of coexisting coronary aery and 3 cerebrovascular disease. The risk of rupture is directly related to the size of aneurysm. An abdominal aoic aneurysm is usually asymptomatic. They are usually detected incidentally on routine clinical examinations or investigation performed for some other reasons. As abdominal aoic aneurysms expand, however, they may become painful. Aneurysmal pain is usually a harbinger of rupture and represents a medical emergency. More often, acute rupture occurs without any prior warning, and this complication is always life-threatening. Contrast-enhanced CT is investigation of choice. MRI is as sensitive and specific as CECT and is used if use of contrast is precluded. Ultrasound is the screening study of choice and is useful for serial documentation of aneurysm size Operative repair of the aneurysm with inseion of a prosthetic graft or endovascular placement of an aoic stent graft is indicated for: - abdominal aoic aneurysms of any size that are expanding rapidly or are associated with symptoms. - for asymptomatic aneurysms, abdominal aoic aneurysm repair is indicated if the diameter is >5.5 cm. The decision to perform an open surgical operation or endovascular repair is based in pa on the vascular anatomy and comorbid conditions. Endovascular repair of abdominal aoic aneurysms has a lower sho-term morbidity rate but a comparable long-term moality rate with open surgical reconstruction. (Harrison 18/e) In Elective surgery of abdominal aoic aneurysm the operative moality, rate approximates 1 to 2% whereas after acute rupture the moality rate of emergency operation generally exceeds 50%.",

        "exp": "Screening of diabetes Fructosamine is the product of a reaction between fructose and protein. Fructosamine is a compound that is fOrmed by the nonenzymatic reaction between fructose and ammonia. When .fructosamines are fanned from blood proteins such as albumin, they are known as glycated serum protein or glycated albumin. Since albumin has much shoer half life than hemoglobin, serum fructosamine generally reflects the state of glycemic control for only the preceeding 2 weeks. Fructosamine measurement has been present since long to monitor sugar control in diabetes. The test for ,fructosamine is simpler and less costly than for glycated hemoglobin. However, the trials have shown it to be too unspecific to replace the increasingly well established and generally recommended determination of HbAc. Glucose control in diabetics is usually assessed with the help of glycosylated hemoglobin that indicates average glucose level over the preceeding 12 weeks as reflected by the permanent glycosylation of a small fraction of the hemoglobin molecule in the blood. However, its measurement is not appropriate where there has been a recent change in the diet or treatment within 6 weeks of if there are abnormalities in red blood cell aging or mix of hemoglobin subtypes (predominantly HbA in normal adults). Hence people with recent blood loss or hymolytic anemia or hemoglobinopathy such as sickle cell disease are not suitable for glycosylated hemoglobin method that do not account for higher turnover of hemoglobin. Fructosamine is used in these circumstances. It is also used in conditions such as pregnancy in which hormonal changes cause greater sho term fluctuation in glucose concentrations. The American diabetes Association says that fructosamine may be a better choice when glycosylated hemoglobin cannot be reliably measured : These situations include: 1) The evaluation of changes in diabetic treatmentQ, since the effects of adjustment can be evaluated after a couple of weeks rather than months. 2) In pregnancyQ, since the glucose and insulin needs of the mother and fetus changes rapidly during gestation. 3) Any condition that effects the average age of red blood cellsQ such as hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia or blood loss. Fructosamine is not affected by such conditions and may be a better choice for monitoring glucose control. 4) In monitoring sho term and intermediate glycemic control. Disadvantages of fructosamine:- Measured fructosamine may be falsely low in the setting of decreased protein levels such as nephrotic syndrome or hepatic disease. Fuher, because of lack of standardization and concern with reproducibility, fructosamine is not recommended for routine use or as a replacement or supplement for glycated hemoglobin in the assessment of glucose in diabetes.",

        "exp": "Apparent exophthalmoses [Ref: Adams victor principles of neurology 8/e p. 2541 Horner's syndrome is a classic neurologic syndrome whose signs include: -- Miosis, - Ptosis, and - Anhidrosis Also called oculosympathetic paresis, a Horner's syndrome can be produced by a lesion anywhere along the sympathetic pathway that supplies the head, eye, and neck. Neuroanatomy Horner's syndrome can result from a lesion anywhere along a three-neuron sympathetic (adrenergic) pathway that originates in the hypothalamus - The first-order neuron - Descends caudally from the hypothalamus to the first synapse, which is located in the cervical spinal cord (levels C8-12, also called ciliospinal center of Budge). - The second-order neuron - Travels .from the sympathetic trunk, through the brachial plexus, over the lung apex. It then ascends to the superior cervical ganglion, located near the angle of the mandible and the bifurcation of the common carotid aery. - The third-order neuron - Then ascends within the adventitia of the internal carotid aery, through the cavernous sinus, where it is in close relation to the sixth cranial nerve. The oculosympathetic pathway then joins the ophthalmic (VI) division of the ,fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve). In the orbit and the eye, the oculosympathetic fibers innervate the iris dilator muscle as well as Muller's muscle, a small smooth muscle in the eyelids responsible for a minor poion of the upper lid elevation and lower lid retraction. Clinical features The classic signs of a Horner's syndrome are: ? - PtosisQ - Miosise - A n hidrosisQ The degree of anisocoria is more marked in the dark than in light. - There is associated dilation lag, an asymeetry in papillary redilation between the two eyes when the light source is moved away .from the eye. - The homer's pupil will redilate more slowly (by 15 to 20 seconds) than the normal pupil. The ptosis is minor (less than 2 mm) and occurs as a result of paralysis of the Muller's muscle, which is innervated by the sympathetic pathway. The lower as well as the upper lid is affected producing the so-called \"upside-down ptosis\". Anhidrosis is present in central or preganglionic (first or second order) lesions. The sympathetic fibers responsible for facial sweating and vasolidation branch off at the superior cervical ganglion from the remainder of the oculosympathetic pathway; thus, anhidrosis is not a feature of postagangkonic or third-order lesions. This sign is .frequently not apparent to patients or clinicians. A congenital Horner's syndrome should be suspected when anisocoria is associated with heterochromia (unequal iris color, with the affected iris being lighter). - This occurs because formation of iris pigment in the first several months of age is under sympathetic control. This may only be apparent if the natural color is relatively dark. ETIOLOGY The etiology of Horner's syndrome in adults relates to the lesion location. First-order syndrome (central) Lesions of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem or cervicothoracic spinal cord can produce a first-order Homer's syndrome. Lateral medullary syndromes (M.C.) - Brainstem disease (stroke, tumour, demyelinating disorder) - Syringomyelia - Cervical cord trauma (including surgery) - Spinal cord tumour - Diabetic autonomic neuropathy - Multiple sclerosis Second-order syndrome (preganglionic) - Trauma or surgery involving spinal cord, thoracic outlet lung apex. - Pancoast tumour - Carotid and Aoic aneurysm and dissection - Lumbar epidural anaesthesia. Third-order syndrome (Postganglionic) - Lesions of internal carotid aery such as - Dissection, thrombosis - Otitis media - Cavernous sinus mass Surgery for raynaud's syndrome (cervical sympathectomy) may cause trauma to cervical spinal cord.",

        "exp": "This patient has the findings that are most consistent with androgen insensitivity syndrome (formerly called testicular feminization syndrome). This syndrome results from genetic defects leading to abnormal androgen receptor function. Patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome are genotypically males (46, XY) but phenotypically females-with breasts and no external male genitaliA. The reason that breasts develop is that estrogens, which are expressed at pubey and which also result from peripheral conversion of androgens, act upon the breast tissues unopposed by androgens because of the androgen receptor defect. This unopposed estrogen leads to breast growth and the resultant breasts are normal sized, although they have undeveloped nipples and pale areolae. There are no internal female organs, because mullerian-inhibiting substance is present during development. There are no external male organs because of the androgen receptor defect. Testicles do exist, but they are intra- abdominal. The gonads have a high rate of malignant degeneration in patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome and therefore, after pubey, they should be removed bilateral gonadectomy. It is impoant to wait until after pubey so that full development can take place. To state that no intervention is necessary (Choice A)is incorrect. If the gonads are not removed from a patient with androgen insensitivity syndrome there is a significant risk that the patient will develop a gonadal malignancy. To perform a unilateral gonadectomy (Choice C) is incorrect. To leave one of the gonads in would still run the risk of malignant degeneration in that gonad.

Japonicum (affecting mainely liver, S. intestine)* - S mansoni (affecting mainly large intestine)* - S. haematobium (affecting mainly the bladder)* The adult S. haematobium worm lives in the prostatovesical plexus of veins. The female worm lays her eggs in the subepithelial layers of the affected viscus. Massive egg deposition leads to severe local reaction with granuloma formation.these are later replaced by fibrous tissue that causes contraction of different pas of the bladder and stricture of ureter. Fibrosis and massive egg deposition interfere with the blood supply of area causing chronic bilharzial ulcerations. Epithelial metaplasia is common and squamous cell ca is a frequent sequela. Secondary inf. of the urinary tract is a common complication. The trapped dead ova become impregnated with calcium salts and forms sheets of subepithelial calcified layer in the bladder wall. This appear on xrays as dense concentric ring of calcification (may resemble featal head in pelvis). Profuse hematuria occurs in patients initially due to penetration of the urothelium by living ova (which are extruded in the urine) and later due to ulceration. Both renal and vesical calculi may form. Advanced ds. leads to small contracted bladder (having a capacity of only few millilitres) with varying degrees of dilatation of the upper urinary tract (hydroureteronephrosis) S. haematobium also involves ureters, seminal vesicles (and to a lesser extent male urethra and prostate gland) leading to strictures and extensive calcifications in these structures. Tuberculosis of kidney and bladder In TB of kidney, a group of tuberculous granulomas form in the renal pyramid. They coalesce and form an ulcer. Untreated the lesion enlarges and a tuberculous abscess may form in the parenchyma. Gradually the kidney is replaced by caseous material (putty kidney*), it may be calcified (cement kidney). Calcifications may appear on the x-ray as calculi (pseudocalculi) Renal tuberculosis is often associated with tuberculosis of the baldder. TB of bladder leads to fibrosis and thus contracture of bladder. Golf-hole ureters* are seen in TB bladder*.",

C: Hashimotos thyroiditis Laboratory investigation of hypothyroidism: In the presence of suggestive symptoms and physical findings, a serum TSH test is needed for the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism, and it serves to assess the functional status of the thyroid. - This is a sensitive test of thyroid function; levels are invariably raised in hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis and in primary hypothyroidism of any cause. - The TSH level is also elevated in subclinical hypothyroidism and is usually the initial laboratory abnormality detected as the pituitary gland attempts to increase thyroid hormone production from the failing thyroid gland. The total T4 or free T4 usually remain within reference ranges in subclinical hypothyroidism. - The TSH level may also be elevated in the recovery phase of euthyroid sick syndrome. Medications that suppress TSH production include steroids, dopamine, dobutamine, and octreotide. A free T4 is usually needed to correctly interpret the TSH in some clinical settings. A low total T4 or free T4 level in the presence of an elevated TSH level fuher confirms the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. When a total T4 study, rather than a free T4 study, is performed, a T3 resin uptake helps to correct the total T4 and T3 values for protein binding, especially thyroid hormone-binding globulin (TBG) abnormalities, but the FT4 is typically the test of choice. T3 levels are most often maintained within reference ranges (even in the very late stages of hypothyroidism), and T3 measurement has little value in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The presence of thyroid autoantibodies, typically anti-TPO (anti thyroid peroxidase) and also anti-Tg (anti-thyroglobulin) antibodies, delineates the cause of hypothyroidism as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or its variant. However, 10-15% of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis may be antibody negative.",

The first changes of rickets appear in rapidly growing distal ends of ulna & radius (wrist & knee are commonly involved due to more use). Rarefaction of provisional zone of calcification with widening of epiphysis- diaphysis distance is first to appear. The most obvious change are at 'metaphysis'- where rapid growth is occurring. First change to appear is a 'loss of normal zone of provisional calcification' adjacent to metaphysis. This begins as an indistinctness of the metaphyseal margin, progressing to a 'frayed' appearance with widening of the growth plate, due to lack of calcification of metaphyseal bone. Weight bearing & stress on uncalcified bone gives rise to 'splaying' Sr 'cupping' of metaphysis. A similar but less marked effect occurs in subperiosteal layer, which may cause lack of distinctness of coical margin. Eventually a generalized reduction in bone density is seen. In the epiphysis - there may be some haziness of coical margin. Thus all findings in Rickets occur due to failure of calcification & abnormal demineralization i.

Pancreatic ascites occurs - when pancreatic juice gains entry into the peritoneal cavity either from a pancreatic duct disruption or - from a leaking pseudocyst The principal causative factors are alcoholic pancreatitis in adults and traumatic pancreatitis in children. The diagnosis can usually be made when high amylase levels are found in the ascitic fluid. Definitive diagnosis is made by ERCP. Management The initial treatment usually is nonoperative and involves attempts to decrease pancreatic secretion by - elimination of enteral feeding - nasogastric drainage and - use of antisecretory hormone somatostatin About 50 to 60 % pts. respond to this tit. If considerably improvement does not occur within 2-3 weeks then these patients are treated either endoscopically or surgically. - Endoscopic tit involves endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy with or without placement of transpapillary pancreatic duct stent. By reducing the resistance to drainage into the duodenum, and by bridging the site of duct disruption, this approach is designed to allow the site of leakage to seal. Surgical treatment is usually preceded by ERCP to identify the site of duct disruption.

Principle of the test : Normally when one leg is raised from the ground the pelvis tilts upwaras on that side, through the action of the hip abductors of the standing limb. If the abductors are inefficient they are unable to sustain the pelvis against the body weight and it tilts downwards instead of rising up on the side of the lifted leg. Note that the test is performed with the patients standing on the affected leg. Abductor mechanism : It can be compared with the lever, with the body weight being trying to tilt the pelvis down; the hip joint being the fulcrum and the abductor muscles being the power acting throught the lever arm (from the head of the femur to attachment of the abductor muscles on the greater trochanter - the neck of the femur). Causes of positive trendelenberg test : Any failure of abductor mechanism causes dipping of the pelvic (ASIS) on the normal side. There are three fundamental causes : 1) Paralysis of the abductor muscles (Supplies gluteus medius & minimus) eg. Polio. Paralysis of superior gluteral nerve 2) Marked approximation of the inseion of the abductor muscles to their origin by upward displacement of the greater trochanter ; so that the muscles are slack. eg.

        "exp": "PSA velocity Several refinements have been proposed to increase the sensitivity of the serum PSA for younger men more likely to die of prostate-cancer, while reducing the frequency of diagnosing cancers of low biologic potential in elderly men more likely to die of other causes. These modifications include age-specific reference ranges, using a lower \"upper\" limit of normal for younger males and higher \"upper\" limit for older individuals. Prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) is calculated by dividing the serum PSA level by the estimated prostate weight calculated from transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). It was proposed to correct for the influence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) on the measured level of PSA. Values <0.10 are consistent with BPH, while values >0.15 suggest the presence of cancer. PSAD levels also increase with age. PSA velocity is derived from calculations of the rate of change in PSA before the diagnosis of cancer was established. Increases of>0.75 ng/mL per year are suggestive of cancer. For a 50-year-old male, an increase from 2.5 to 3.9 ng/mL in a I-year period would warrant fuher testing, even though the level is still in the \"normal\" range. Free and complexed PSA measurements are used to determine which men require a biopsy when the PSA level is in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL. In cancer, the level of free PSA is lower. Using a 25% threshold of free PSA for patients with levels in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL, specificity was improved by 20% while maintaining a sensitivity of95%. Fuher refinements to increase the specificity of distinguishing benign and malignant conditions involve the determination of the ratios of free to total, complexed to total, and free to complexed PSA. Using normal ranges for free/total PSA of>O .15, for complexed total PSA of <0.70, and for free/complexed PSA of>0.25 improved specificity in one study by 20%.

The ascending aoa is injured in 20 to 25% of cases at autopsy but most of these patients die at the scene from serious complications such as a ruptured aoic valve, coronary aery laceration or haemopericardium with pericardial tamponade.\" Aoic isthmus is poion of the proximal descending thoracic aoa between the left subclan aery origin and the ligamentum aeriosum. Tethering of the aoa by the ligamentum aeriosum is believed to account for the high frequency of aoic injury in the isthmus region.
