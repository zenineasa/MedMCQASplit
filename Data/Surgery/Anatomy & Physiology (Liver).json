The subhepatic space communicates with the lesser sac via the foramen of Winslow.Related pathology# Fluid (e.g. ascites or haemoperitoneum) accumulates here as it is the lowest dependent spaces of the peritoneal cavity from a wide range of causes.

Variations of this are common, and in 78% of individuals the caudate lobe drains into both the left and right hepatic duct. Diseases of the Liver and Biliary System in Children By Deirdre A. Kelly, Dame Sheila (FRW) Sherlock 3/ep7The right and left hepatic ducts join to form the common hepatic duct which joins the cystic duct to form the common bile duct.Functional anatomy of liver The functional anatomy of the liver is composed of 8 segments, each of which is supplied by its own portal triad or pedicle (composed of a portal vein, hepatic artery and a bile duct)These segments are further organised into 4 sectors separated by scissura containing the 3 main hepatic veins. (Thus the three main hepatic veins divide liver into 4 sectors). The 4 sectors are even further organized into right & left liver. Segments I to IV compose the left liver and segments V to VIII the rightThus the right hepatic duct drains all segments of the right lobe and the left duct all segments of the left lobe.Caudate lobe or the segment I is drained by both right and left",
