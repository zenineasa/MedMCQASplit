        "question": "A child comes with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome secondary to FSGS. not responsive to methylprednisolone. What next should be given aEUR'",
        "exp": "Oral cyclosporine [Ref. Indian society of pediatric nephrology (MIMS) Dr. Arvind Bagga Aicle from Indian Journal of pediatrics volume 46 January 17, 20091 There is a lack of evidence based guidelines for management of children with steroid resistant nephritic syndrome (SRNS). - Expes of the Indian society of peadiatric nephrology were involved in two stage process and gave the following guidelines:? Definitions of coicosteroid resistant nephrotic syndrome A patient is diagnosed to have steroid resistance if there is lack of remission despite treatment with prednisolone at a dose of 2 nig/kg/day (60 mg/m2/day) for 4 weeks. Remission is defined as absence of proteinuria (urine albumin nil or trace for three consecutive days by dipstick or boiling test). - Following treatment with daily prednisolone, 95% patients with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome achieve remission by the .first 4 weeks and an additional 3% in additional 4 weeks. Prolonged cources of daily coicosteroids are associated with increased incidence of side effects. Therefore, defining SRNS as lack of remission despite 4 weeks treatment with daily prednisolone is reasonable. - This definition is in conformity with that used by the Cochrane Renal Group. The national Institutes of Health (USA) trial on patients with steroid resistant .focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) has accepted a similar definition. All children with SRNS, whether initial or late. should undergo a renal biopsy before instituting specific treatment. Despite absence of evidence based recommendations regarding the role of renal biopsy in patients with SRNS, this procedure provides impoant information on renal histology and outcome. Most patients with steroid sensitive nephritic syndrome (90%) show minimal change nephritic syndrome on renal histology. - The renal histology in SRNS is different, with 30-40% patients each showing minimal change nephritic syndrome and FSGS, and a smaller group with mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (8). The response to therapy is determined by renal histology; patients with minimal change nephritic syndrome show satisfactory response to therapy, while presence of FSGS or chronic tubulointerstitial changes is associated with unsatisfactory outcomes. A renal biopsy is also necessary before initiating treatment with potentially nephrotoxic agents, especially cyclospo- rine or tacrolimus. Mutational Analysis Studies for mutations of genes involved in synthesis of podocyte protein are not routinely necessary in children with SRNS. Where facilities exist, mutational analysis may be offered to patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome (onset below 3 months of age), initial steroid resistance and family history of a SRNS). - Mutations in the genes encoding various podocyte proteins, including podocin (NHHS2) and nephrin (NPHS1), have been described in a variable propoion of patients with familial and sporadic SRNS. - The likelihood of detecting a mutation is higher in patients with family history of nephrotic syndrome or its onset in infancy. Patients with mutations involving these genes often do not respond to immunosuppressive medications and show progressive kidney disease. - In view of lack of data in Indian children, routine mutational analysis in patients with initial SRNS is not recommended. Patients with late steroid resistance have not been. found to have genetic mutations. Principles of therapy Patients with idiopathic SRNS secondary to minimal change nephrotic syndrome, FSGS and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis should receive similar therapy. Review of the of the literature suggests that patients with steroid resistance secondary to minimal change nephrotic syndrome are more likely to achieve remission and have a better prognosis compared to other histological types. However, a systemic review by the Cochrane Renal Group showed similar outcome in patients with steroid resistant minimal outcome in patients with steroid resistant minimal change nephrotic syndrome and FSGS who were treated with cyclosporine or cyclophosphamide. - There is not clear evidence to suppo that patients with minimal change nephrotic syndrome and FSGS should be treated differently. Specific treatment The aim of therapy is induction of remission while avoiding medication related toxicity. The option for treatment for patients with idiopathic SRNS include :? Cakineurin inhibitors with tapering doses of alternate day steroids : ? Cyclosporine - Tacrolimus Cvclophosphamide oral and I.V. with tapering doses of alternate day steroids. Pulse coicosteroids -high dose intravenous steroids (dexamethasone, methyl- prednisolone) with oral cyclophosphamide and tapering alternate day steroids. There is lack of consensus on the most appropriate first line therapy for children with SRNS, with many of the regimens extrapolated from studies in adults. - The level of evidence on efficacies of available regimens is summarized below. \"From these evidences calcineurin inhibitors i.e. cyclosporine and Tacrolimus seems to be the most effective drugs for steroid resistant nephritic syndrome\". An impoant point There is still lack of consensus on first line appropriate therapy for steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome.",

        "exp": "Metabolic acidosis The question is most probably about complications of massive blood transfusion. Massive Blood Transfusion Massive blood transfusion is generally defined as transfusion of one to two volumes of patient's own blood volumes (For most adults, that is equivalent to 10-20 units.) Complications of Massive Blood Transfusion i) Coagulopathy The most common cause of bleeding following massive blood transfusion is dilutional thrombocytopenia Clinically significant dilution of the coagulation factors is unusual in previously normal individuals. ii) Citrate Toxicity Citrate is used as an anticoagulant in the stored blood. Citrate has a propey to bind calcium, this calcium binding by the citrate preservative can become significant following transfusion of large volumes of blood or blood products. Hypocalcemia results in some patients after massive transfusion, to prevent this, the transfusion rate should not exceed 1 unit every 5 minutes. Citrate also has an affinity for magnesium ion and the occurrence of hypomagnesemia in the setting of massive transfusion is seen (rarely). iii) Hypothermia Blood is stored at a temperature of 2degC-6degC. So massive blood transfusion can result in hypothermia. Massive blood transfusion is an absolute indication for warming all blood products and intravenous fluids to normal body temperature. Hypothermia due to massive transfusion can result in venticular arryhthmia. iv) Acid-Base Balance The stored blood is acidic for two reasons. - Due to the citric acid (the anticoagulants) - Due to release of metabolic products by the anaerobic glycolysis of red cells (CO2 and Lactate). Despite the Stored Blood Being Acidic, Significant metabolic acidosis due to transfusion is not common. - Once the resuscitation is complete and normal perfusion is restored, any metabolic acidosis present, typically resolves, and progressive metabolic alkalosis supervenes as citrate and lactate contained in transfusion and resuscitation fluids are conveed to bicarbonate by the liver. The most consisent acid base abnormality after massive blood transfusion is postoperative metabolic alkalosis. v)Serum Potassium Concentration The extracellular concentration of Potassium in stored blood steadily increases with time due to lvsis of BBC's. The amount of extracellular potassium transfused with each unit is typically less than 4m Eq per unit. Hyperkalemia can develop regardless of the age of the blood when transfusion rate exceede 100m1/min. 688 vi) Oxygen Affinity Changes 2,3 DPG is greatly reduced in RBC's after about 3 weeks of storage, this increases hemoglobin's affinity for oxyen and adversely affects oxygen delivery to tissues. vii) Acute Respiration.'

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' ie. Duodenal Ulcer Hematemesis is suggestive of massive upper GI bleed, the impoant causes of which in descending order are Peptic ulcer Duodenal ulcer (MC cause) Gastric ulcer Esophageal varices Gastritis Mallory weiss tear Neoplams of esophagus, stomach and duodenum Duodenal ulcer : Peptic ulcer is the most common cause of upper GI bleeding, present in one-half to two-third of pts. with upper GI bleed. Bleeding may be the initial presenting symptoms in up to 10 percent of pts with peptic ulcer. Duodenal ulcer bleeding is four times more common than gastric ulcer bleeding. Esophageal varices : Bleeding esophageal varices or gastric varices in the presence of liver disease account for about 10-20% of massive upper GI bleeding. In this pt. esophageal varices appears to be the cause as the pt. is a chronic alcoholic But here the amount he drinks daily should be taken into consideration. In men 40 - 80 g/day of ethanol --> produces fatty liver 80 - 160 g/day of ethanol for 10 - 20 yrs --> causes hepatitis or cirrhosis (Women exhibit increased susceptibility* to alcoholic liver disease at quantities > 20 g/day) He drinks 100 ml daily. Different types of drinks contain varied amounts of alcohol. What this pt. drinks is not known but even strong drinks such as 86-proof beverage contains 80 gm of ethanol in 250 ml of drinks (Wine contain 80 gm of ethanol in 1000 ml of drinks) Thus this patient is unlikely to have an alcoholic liver disease and so esophageal varices can be ruled out. Moreever even in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, varices are cause of massive GI bleed in only 1/2 the cases. Peptic ulcer or gastritis form rest of the half. Mallory-Weiss tear It accounts for a small percentage (5 to 10%) It presents in a classic pattern - initially vomitting is without blood, but after retching and vomitting with epigastric pain, bleeding and haematemesis begin. Gastritis Acute gastritis can presents as massive bleeding (though rarely) It is most commonly associated with intake of NSAIDS, alcohol, coicosteroids and oral potassium supplements. I do not have any valid reason to rule out gastritis. But duodenal ulcer is much more common cause.",

Weakness is gradual over days or weeks, beginning in the lower extremities and progressing toward the trunk. Later, the upper limbs and the bulbar muscles can become involved.

Measurement of spinal fluid protein is helpful in the diagnosis; protein levels are increased to more than twice normal, while glucose and cell counts are normal. Hospitalization for observation is indicated. Treatment can consist of intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, or plasmapheresis. Recovery is not always complete.

This is known as 'clorsillexion test' and can be used as a screening test. Ahrogryposis Multiplex Congenita is a rare congenital disorder that is characterized by multiple joint contractures and muscle atrophy and fibrosis. It is a non-progressive disease. CTEV can be seen as one of the components of AMC. So AMC can also be the answer but since it's much rarer than CTEV and in the question other joints involvement is not mentioned, answer would be `CTEV'. Congenital veical talus is a'rare disease usually affecting both feet, characterized by rigid flatfoot deformity, with the plantar aspect of the foot having a convex contour. The heel is in valgus, and the forefoot is abducted and dorsiflexed. In the newborn having this condition, the dorsal aspect of the foot may be in close approximation to the distal aspect of tibia. Flat foot or Pes planus is a condition characterized by varying degrees of loss of the longitudinal arch of the foot. This condition can be normal which usually disappears as the child grows, or can be pathological as seen in Congenital veical talus, tarsal coalition, inflammatory joint disorder or a neurological disorder. Congenital Talipes Equinovarus (Idiopathic club-food -Talipes is a term for any foot deformity that centres around the talus. - Equinus implies that the foot is flexed in the plantar direction. - Varus implies that the foot is inveed and adducted so that the sole faces inwards. CTEV is a complex deformity of the foot where the foot is both turned and twisted inwards so that the sole faces posteromedially. Deformities noted are: - plantar flexion (equines) - in version - adduction - supination - sometimes cavus (high medial arch) The involved foot is generally smaller than the opposite side with varying amounts of calf atrophy. More common in boys (2:1) Bilateral in 1/3 cases.(Ret Apley's Ohopaedics 11/e 591) Clinical tests in CTEV: 1)Dorsiflexion test: described above. 2)Plumbline test: This test helps to detect the tibial torsion. The child is made to sit on a table with both the lower limbs hanging from the edge. A line drawn from the centre of the patella to the tibial tubercle when extended down, should cut the foot at the first or second intermetatarsal space normally. This is called the pulmline. In CTEV, with medial rotation of the tibia. the plumbline cuts the zith or 5th intermetatarsal space. 3)Scratch test: This test is performed to detect muscle imbalance in an infant who cannot obey commands. - Medial scratch test- In a normal child when the medial sole is scratched, the foot eves. The tests the peroneals. - Lateral scratch test- When the lateral sole is scratched, the child inves the foot. This tests the inveors. X-ray: Radiographs AP and Lateral are obtained in maximally corrected position. The talo-calcaneal angle (Kite's angle) obtained in both AP and lateral views is reduced in CTEV.",

A: Hyperplastic change in the lining mucosa of esophagusBarrett esophagus is a premalignant condition that involves the distal esophagus and appears to be related to chronic gastroesophageal reflux (GORD).There is metaplastic change in the lining mucosa of esophagus.Usually there are no paicular severe symptoms, although they do have the most abnormal pH profiles. Patients with Barrett esophagus are predisposed to the most rapidly increasing cause of cancer.The diagnosis of Barrett esophagus is made at endoscopy when the normal, whitish-appearing squamous epithelium is found to be replaced by a reddish, velvety-appearing intestinal type of columnar epithelium.Barrett esophagus is thought to evolve to cancer through various stages of dysplasia.Initially, no dysplasia is found; subsequently, low-grade dysplasia develops in the mucosa, then high-grade dysplasia, and finally carcinoma. Dysplasia is considered indefinite when histological changes are not definitive for dysplasia. Most of these changes cannot be visualized endoscopically.The hallmark of specialized Barrett's epithelium is the presence of mucus-secreting goblet cells (intestinal metaplasia). Patients are usually monitored by a program of periodic surveillance endoscopy during which biopsy specimens are taken in 4 quadrants every 2 cm throughout the Barrett segment.Treatment is that of the underlying cause of GORD",

ANA are a specific class of autoantibodics that have the capability of binding and destroying ceain structures within the nucleus of the cells. Not only are these antibodies involved in the disease pathogenesis, but they also constitute the basis for diagnosis and treatment of CTD. Their detection with high sensitivity and specificity is therefore of utmost impoance. Although a battery of laboratory tests are available for ANA detection indirect immunofluorescence antinuclear antibody test (IF-ANA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA)/enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) arc commonly used in day to day practice. The IF-ANA test detects the presence of ANA in the blood of the patient which adhere to reagent test cells (substrate), forming distinct fluorescence patterns that are associated with ceain autoimmune diseases.

Laboratory studies show elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and high urine hydroxyproline. X-ray findings are consistent with Paget disease. Which of the following is the most likely pathogenetic mechanism of this condition?",
        "exp": "Paget disease, also known as osteitis deformans, is a frequent bone condition affecting middle-aged to elderly persons. Usually polyostotic, it affects the axial skeleton, including the spine, pelvis, proximal femur, and head. Often, it presents with gradual enlargement of the head and chronic bone pain. Affected bone is thickened and coarse, with disorderly osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. Paget himself proposed a viral hypothesis for the pathogenesis of this condition, but only recent immunologic and molecular techniques have allowed identification of paramyxoviruses (measles and respiratory syncytial virus) in osteoclasts of affected bones. In most cases, the diagnosis can be made by radiologic investigations. Generalized reduction in bone mass is the defining feature of osteoporosis. In its most common form, the condition affects elderly persons, especially women after menopause. It characteristically causes compression fractures of veebral bones or pathologic fractures of the femoral neck. Genetic deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II is one cause of the rare hereditary disorders collectively known as osteopetrosis, which are due to osteoclast dysfunction. This condition manifests in infancy or childhood with bone fragility and recurrent fractures. The bone has a stony hard consistency, but is brittle. Monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells is the underlying cause of multiple myeloma, the most frequent primary bone neoplasm. Multiple myeloma results in multifocal accumulation of neoplastic plasma cells in bones, manifesting with punched-out osteolytic lesions on x-ray films. Veebrae, skull, ribs and pelvic bones are most frequently affected.",

        "question": "Torsion of testes is may be due to: March 2013 (e, f)",
        "exp": "Ans. D i.e. All of the above Testicular torsion It is the torsion of the spermatic cord structures and subsequent loss of the blood supply to the ipsilateral testicle. This is a urological emergency; early diagnosis and treatment are vital to saving the testicle and preserving future feility. Testicular torsion is primarily a disease of adolescents and neonates. It is the most common cause of testicular loss in these age groups. Surgical treatment may prevent fuher ischemic damage to the testis. Testicular torsion is caused by twisting of the spermatic cord and the blood supply to the testicle. With mature attachments, the tunica vaginalis is attached securely to the posterior lateral aspect of the testicle, and, within it, the spermatic cord is not very mobile. If the attachment of the tunica vaginalis to the testicle is inappropriately high, the spermatic cord can rotate within it, which can lead to intravaginal torsion. This defect is referred to as the bell clapper deformity. This occurs in about 17 % of males and is bilateral in 40%. Intravaginal torsion most commonly occurs in adolescents. It is thought that the increased weight of the testicle after pubey, as well as sudden contraction of the cremasteric muscles (which inses in a spiral fashion into the spermatic cord), is the impetus for acute torsion. By contrast, neonates more often have extravaginal torsion. This occurs because the tunica vaginalis is not yet secured to the gubernaculum and, therefore, the spermatic cord, as well as the tunica vaginalis, undergo torsion as a unit. Extravaginal torsion is not associated with bell clapper deformity. This can occur up to months prior to bih. Of course, neonates can have intravaginal torsion and this should be managed in the same manner as adolescents. Testicular torsion is associated with testicular malignancy, especially in adults According to Prehn's sign, the physical lifting of the testicles relieves the pain of epididymitis but not pain caused by testicular torsion",

Histological evaluation of the tumor revealed small, highly mitotic cells, scant cytoplasm with hyperchromatic nuclei. Which of the following clinical presentation might occur in the patient during the course of his illness?",
        "exp": "Ans is 'a' i.e. Thin extremities, central obesity Small, highly mitotic cells, scant cytoplasm with hyperchromatic nuclei suggest small cell ca. Paraneoplastic syndromes are common in patients with lung cancer, especially those with small cell ca, and may be the presenting finding or the first sign of recurrence. Small cell ca are paicularly associated with ACTH and ADH secretion causing Cushing's syndrome and SIADH. Small Cell Carcinomas have a distinctive cell type. The epithelial cells are relatively small, with scant cytoplasm, ill-defined cell borders, finely granular nuclear chromatin (salt and pepper pattern), and absent or inconspicuous nucleoli. The mitotic count is high. The cells grow in clusters that exhibit neither glandular nor squamous organization. Basophilic staining of vascular walls due to encrustation by DNA from necrotic tumor cells (Azzopardi effect) is frequently present. Squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by the presence of keratinization and/or intercellular bridges. Keratinization may take the form of squamous pearls or individual cells with markedly eosinophilic dense cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is higher in poorly differentiated tumors. Adenocarcinomas vary histologically from well-differentiated tumors with obvious glandular elements to papillary lesions resembling other papillary carcinomas to solid masses with only occasional mucin-producing glands and cells. The majority are positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and about 80% contain mucin. Large Cell Carcinoma is an undifferentiated malignant epithelial tumor that lacks the cytologic features of small-cell carcinoma and glandular or squamous differentiation. The cells typically have large nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and a moderate amount of cytoplasm. Paraneoplastic Syndromes. Lung carcinoma can be associated with several paraneoplastic syndromes, some of which may precede the development of a detectable pulmonary lesion. The hormones or hormone-like factors elaborated include: Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), inducing hyponatremia due to inappropriate ADH secretion Adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH), producing Cushing syndrome Parathormone, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, prostaglandin E, and some cytokines, all implicated in the hypercalcemia often seen with lung cancer Calcitonin, causing hypocalcemia Gonadotropins, causing gynecomastia Serotonin and bradykinin, associated with the carcinoid syndrome Any one of the histological types of tumors may occasionally produce any one of the hormones, but tumors that produce ACTH and ADH are predominantly small cell carcinomas, whereas those that produce hypercalcemia are mostly squamous cell tumors. Cushing syndrome ACTH secretion is almost always associated with small cell carcinoma. About 30% of all cases of SCLC are associated with hypersecretion of ACTH. However, a clinical apparent Cushing syndrome is rare. Cushing syndrome has been described in 1 to 5% of patients with SCLC following symptoms : Centripetal obesity, facial plethora, glucose intolerance, weakness, proximal myopathy, hypeension, psychological changes, easy bruisability, hirsutism, oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, impotence, acne, oily skin, abdominal striae, ankle edema, osteoporosis, polydipsia, polyuria, hyperpigmentation, headache, fungal infection specially oral thrush and hypokalimea. Treatment with standard medications, such as metyrapone and ketoconazole, is largely ineffective due to extremely high coisol levels. The most effective strategy for management of Cushing's syndrome is effective treatment of the underlying SCLC. Bilateral adrenalectomy may be considered in extreme cases. Hypercalcemia resulting from ectopic production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), or more commonly, PTH-related peptide, is the most common life-threatening metabolic complication of malignancy, primarily occurring with squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. Clinical symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, polyuria, thirst, and altered mental status. If untreated hypercalcaemia may lead eventually to confusion and coma. Renal failure and nephrocalcinosis are late manifestations. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion Caused by elevated levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) SIDAH is frequently caused by small cell carcinoma. Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting are common symptoms. A rapid onset of hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema. This may lead to irritability, restlessness, personality changes, confusion, coma, seizures, and respiratory arrest. Skeletal-connective tissue syndromes include clubbing in 30% of cases (usually NSCLCs) and hyperophic primary osteoahropathy in 1-10% of cases (usually adenocarcinomas). Patients may develop periostitis, causing pain, tenderness, and swelling over the affected bones and a positive bone scan. Neurologic-myopathic syndromes are seen in only 1% of patients but are dramatic and include the myasthenic Eaton-Lambe syndrome and retinal blindness with SCLC, while peripheral neuropathies, subacute cerebellar degeneration, coical degeneration, and polymyositis are seen with all lung cancer types. Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis and sensory neuropathies, cerebellar degeneration, limbic encephalitis, and brainstem encephalitis occur in SCLC in association with a variety of antineuronal antibodies such as anti-Hu, antiCRMP5, and ANNA-3. Coagulation, thrombotic, or other hematologic manifestations occur in 1-8% of patients and include migratory venous thrombophlebitis (Trousseau's syndrome), nonbacterial thrombotic (marantic) endocarditis with aerial emboli, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with hemorrhage, anemia, granulocytosis, and leukoerythroblastosis. Thrombotic disease complicating cancer is usually a poor prognostic sign. Cutaneous manifestations such as dermatomyositis and acanthosis nigricans are uncommon (1%).",

This disorder almost always occurs in cigarette smokers at a young age (usually below 35years) and is often associated with HLA-A9,B5 genotypes. It used to be found exclusively in men, but recently there has been an increase in the number of repoed cases in women. The vessels primarily affected are in the extremities, and this leads to painful ischemia and gangrene of the legs and arms due to thrombosis. Histologic sections reveal an acute inflammatory infiltrate involving the entire wall of the vessel. In contrast to atherosclerosis, small microabscesses may be seen within thrombi. The inflammation leads to intimal proliferation that obliterates the lumen and causes pain. The disease may regress on cessation of smoking. In contrast, granulomatous inflammation with giant cells involving blood vessels can be seen with temporal aeritis orTakayasu's aeritis. Fragmentation of neutrophils surrounding blood vessels is called leukocytoclastic vasculitis, the differential for which includes microscopic polyaeritis nodosa, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, Wegener's granulomatosis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome.",

Increasing intracranial pressure tends to displace brain tissue away from the source of the pressure; if the pressure is sufficient, herniation of the uncal process through the tentorium cerebri occurs. Pupillary dilation is caused by compression of the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve and its parasympathetic fibers. If the pressure is not relieved, the contralateral oculomotor nerve will become involved and, ultimately, the brainstem will herniate through the foramen magnum and cause death. Hypeension and bradycardia are preterminal events.

Other pathogens implicated infrequently include Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Candida spp. and Salmonella spp. Most mild cases of AAD are due to non-infectious causes which include reduced break down of primary bile acids and decrease metabolism of carbohydrates, allergic or toxic effects of antibiotic on intestinal mucosa and pharmacological effect on gut motility. The antibiotics most frequently associated with C. difficile associated diarrhoea are clindamycin, cephalosporin, ampicillin and amoxicillin. Clinical presentation may vary from mild diarrhoea to severe colitis and pseudomembranous colitis associated with high morbidity and moality. The most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for C. difficile infection is tissue culture assay for cytotoxicity of toxin B. Commercial ELISA kits are available. Though less sensitive, they are easy to perform and are rapid. Withdrawal of precipitating antibiotic is all that is needed for control of mild to moderate cases. For severe cases of AAD, oral metronidazole is the first line of treatment, and oral vancomycin is the second choice.",

The patient may sta with a low cardiac output due to the leaky capillaries with loss of fluid and because the vasodilated aerial tree requires a larger blood volume to fill it (relative hypovolaemia). With appropriate fluid volume replacement the hea will pump against lower resistance and therefore there will often be an increase in cardiac output in order to compensate for the reduction in SVR.

Cystic neoplasm of Pancreas Cystic neoplasms are of the following types: Common types? a. Serous cystadenomas (approx. 25-30% of all cystic neoplasms) b. Mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas (appro. 40-50% of all cystic neoplasms) Uncommon types? c. intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (approx.10% of all cystic neoplasms) d. solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (about 5-10% of all cystic neoplasms) Serous cystadenomas Serous cystadenomas are benign tumors without malignant potential. (Serous cystadenocarcinoma has been repoed very rarely (<1%) They have a spongy appearance, composed of multiple small cysts (microcystic). May contain central stellate fibrotic scar that may calcify (sunburst calcification) and it is highly specific and considered to be viually pathognomonic of serous cystadenoma. The cyst is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. They do not produce mucin These lesions thus contain thin serous fluid that does not stain positive for mucin and is low in CEA (<200 ng/mL). Common in females (F:M ratio is 2:1), usually in 7th decade of life. Common in the head/ uncinate process region.(50% in the head/uncinate process, and 50% in the neck, body, or tail) Serous cystadenomas do not have malignant potential, hence operated only when symptomatic. Mucionous cystic neoplasms (cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma) Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) encompass a spectrum ranging from benign but potentially malignant (i.e. cystadenomas) to carcinoma with a very aggressive behavior (i.e. cystadenocarcinomas); suggesting a gradual malignant transformation. MCNs are composed of large thick-walled, septate cysts (macrocystic) with no connection to the ductal system. (difference .from 1PMN there tumor is connected to the ductal system) The cysts are lined by tall columnar epithelium that fills the cyst with viscous mucin. MCNs are characterised by the presence of ovarian-type stroma which is a key pathologic feature distinguishing these lesions. This stroma is not only morphologically similar to that of the ovarian coex, but also expresses oestrogen and progesterone receptors that are detectable by immunohistochemistry Females are much more commonly affected than males (ratio 9:1), with mean age of 50 years. MCNs predominantly involve the body and tail of the pancreas. High CEA levels in the fluid (>200 ng/mL) may suggest malignant transformation. Resection is the treatment of choice for MCNs as the best way to distinguish the entirely benign form (mucinous cystadenoma) from its malignant counterpa (mucinous cystadenocarcinoma) is pathologic assessment after complete surgical removal. Because most MCNs are located in the body and tail of the pancreas, distal pancreatectomy is the most common treatment. IPMNs IPMNs are similar to MCNs in that they are cystic tumors that secrete mucin. The epithelial lining of the cyst is by tall columnar mucin producing cells that frequently forms papillary projections. Two major differences from MCNs is: - IPMNs extensively involve the main pancreatic ducts or the major side branches (or both); whereas MCNs do not connect to the pancreatic duct system. - IPMNs lack the 'ovarian' stroma seen in MCNs. Mucin production by cells leads to intraductal mucin accumulation and subsequent cystic dilation. This mucin production may be so great that mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater. On ERCP, mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater, a so-called fish-eye lesion, that is viually diagnostic of IPMN Like MCNs IPMNs can range from benign (IPMN adenomas) to malignant (IPMN carcinomas) In contrast to mucinous cystic neoplasms, IPMNs arise more frequently in men than in women, and they involve the head of the pancreas more often than the tail.

        "exp": "Ans. C: Stricture involving the colon is found in ulcerative colitisCrohn's disease/regional enteritis) is an autoimmune disease, which can affect any pa of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus (terminal ileum is the area most commonly affected).Anal lesions are also commonThe disease is characterized by areas of inflammation with areas of normal lining between in a symptom known as skip lesions.Microscopy of Crohn's disease show focal areas of chronic inflammation involving all layers of the intestinal walls.There are non-caseating granulomas, but these are found in only 60% of patients.The main gastrointestinal symptoms are:Abdominal pain may be the initial symptom of Crohn's disease. It is often accompanied by diarrhea, especially in those who have had surgery. The diarrhea may or may not be bloody.The nature of the diarrhea in Crohn's disease depends on the pa of the small intestine or colon that is involved. Ileitis typically results in large-volume watery feces. Colitis may result in a smaller volume of feces of higher frequency.Visible bleeding in the feces is less common in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis, but may be seen in the setting of Crohn's colitis.Although the association is greater in the context of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease may also be associated with primary sclerosing cholangitisPerianal discomfo may also be prominent in Crohn's disease. Itchiness or pain around the anus may be suggestive of inflammation, fistulization or abscess around the anal area or anal fissure.Crohn's disease is associated with a type of rheumatologic disease known as seronegative spondyloahropathy. This group of diseases is characterized by inflammation of one or more joints (ahritis) or muscle inseions (enthesitis). Common complications of inflammation include scarring that can produce intestinal blockage (obstruction) and deep ulcers penetrating through the bowel wall that can create pus-filled pockets of infection (abscesses) or abnormal connecting channels between the intestine and other organs (fistulas).When the large intestine is affected extensively by Crohn's disease, rectal bleeding commonly occurs.After many years, the risk of colon cancer (cancer of the large intestine) is greatly increased.About one third of people who develop Crohn's disease have problems around the anus, especially fistulas and cracks (fissures) in the lining of the mucus membrane of the anus.Crohn's disease may lead to complications in other pas of the body. These complications include gallstones, inadequate absorption of nutrients, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and deposits of the protein amyloid in several organs (amyloidosis).A colonoscopy is the best test for making the diagnosis of Crohn's disease as it allows direct visualization of the colon and the terminal ileum, identifying the pattern of disease involvement. Finding a patchy distribution of disease, with involvement of the colon or ileum but not the rectum, is suggestive of Crohn's disease, as are other endoscopic stigmata. The most common disease that mimics the symptoms of Crohn's disease is ulcerative colitis, as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the colon with similar symptoms.It is impoant to differentiate these diseases, since the course of the diseases and treatments may be different.",

Thus, ZDV can be highly effective for primary prevention in the newborn. Although a cesarean section has been shown to reduce veical transmission, it is less effective than ZDV and is not a routinely recommended procedure for HIV-infected pregnant women. HIV can be transmitted by breast feeding, and in some studies, the risk is increased by 14 percent. However, breast feeding has no impact on the highest risk of transmission, which occurs during gestation, labor, and delivery.

Standard treatment for patients with Klippel- Trenaunay syndrome is gradual suppo stockings, limited stab avulsion of symptomatic varices after thorough duplex ultrasound vein mapping, and occasional surgery for correction of limb length discrepancy\".

        "exp": "This baby has presented with the typical picture of pyloric stenosis. Projectile nonbilious vomiting is seen in viually all patients. Patients also often develop a hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis from the persistent vomiting. On exam, the upper abdomen may be distended after feeding and prominent peristaltic waves from left to right may be seen. The classic physical exam finding of an \"olive-shaped\" mass in the epigastric area is not always felt. An ultrasound is the least invasive, safest diagnostic test. The typical appearance on ultrasound is a hypoechoic ring with a hyperdense center. The pyloric muscle thickness measures greater than 4mm. Since this patient has the symptoms of pyloric stenosis, it is inappropriate to do nothing (choice A). A plain film of the abdomen (choice B) will most likely appear normal unless there is a complete obstruction of the pyloric outlet. Again, this study would expose the baby to unnecessary radiation. And, in this case, it would not help you to establish the diagnosis. A barium enema (choice D) will not help to make the diagnosis in this patient. The fact that the vomitus is nonbilious puts the point of obstruction prior to the entrance of the sphincter of Oddi. A study performed from below will not help to see what is happening so high in the intestinal tract. If you suspected intussusception (paroxysmal abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, heme-positive stool, and sausage-shaped mass in upper mid abdomen on palpation), then a barium enema (or air enema) would be both diagnostic and therapeutic.",

Some patient may have oropharyngeal leucoplakia, and this may account for an alleged risk of developing hypopharyngeal cancer. Barrett esophagus is a premalignant condition that involves the distal esophagus and appears to be related to chronic gastroesophageal reflux (CORD). There is metaplastic change in the lining mucosa of esophagus. Usually there are no paicular severe symptoms, although they do have the most abnormal pH profiles. Patients with Barrett esophagus are predisposed to the most rapidly increasing cause of cancer. The diagnosis of Barrett esophagus is made at endoscopy when the normal, whitish-appearing squamous epithelium is found to be replaced by a reddish, velvety-appearing intestinal type of columnar epithelium. Barrett esophagus is thought to evolve to cancer through various stages of dysplasia. Initially, no dysplasia is found; subsequently, low-grade dysplasia develops in the mucosa, then high-grade dysplasia, and finally carcinoma. Dysplasia is considered indefinite when histological changes are not definitive for dysplasia. Most of these changes cannot be visualized endoscopically. The hallmark of specialized Barrett's epithelium is the presence of mucus-secreting goblet cells (intestinal metaplasia). Patients are usually monitored by a program of periodic surveillance endoscopy during which biopsy specimens are taken in 4 quadrants every 2 cm throughout the Barrett segment. Treatment is that of the underlying cause of CORD Zenker's diveiculum is not really an esophageal diveiculum as it protrudes posteriorly above the cricopharyngeal sphincter through the natural weak point (the dehiscence of Killian).As the pouch enlarges , it tends to filled with food on eating, and the fundus descends into mediastinum.This leads to halitosis and esophageal dysphagia.",

Symptoms of Bladder outlet obstruction and back pains (due to bony metastasis in the pelvis & lumbar veebra) indicate towards prostate Ca. Serum acid phosphatase is a tumor marker of prostate Ca. But now serum acid phosphatase assay has been superseeded by PSA assay (Prostate specific antigen). Prostate specific antigen It is a glycoprotein produced only in the prostatic cells (both benign & malignant). It facilitates liquefaction of semen. It is neither sensitive nor specific for early prostate carcinoma (it is prostate specific and not prostate cancer specific), neveheless it gives some help in making a diagnosis. * Normal serum level ----> less than 4 ng/ml* * 4 - 10 ng/ml ----> this range is common for both BHP and Ca.* * More than 10 ng/ml --> approx 75% will have cancer.* Since PSA is not specific for Ca, PSA Velocity & PSA density are used to detect Prostate cancer. PSA velocity is the rate of change in PSA levels over time and is expressed most commonly as the PSA doubling time. For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than .75 ng/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0.5 ng/mL per year should be used to advise biopsy. PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level. - Values < 0.10 are consistent with BPH. - > 0.15 suggest cancer",

        "exp": "C i.e. Movement of TT towards lateral border of patella Tibial tuberosity is in line with midline of patellaQ at 90deg of knee flexion. However, when the knee is extended fully the TT moves laterally towards the lateral border of patella because of screw home mechanism (i.e. lateral rotation of tibia in non weight bearing or medial rotation of femur in weight bearing individuals). The Q. (quadriceps or patello-femoral) angle provides a concomitant lateral (valgus) force on patella which tends to make the patella track laterally. These last few degree of motion lock the knee in extension & referred to as screw home mechanism. With the knee fully extended, an individual can stand for a long time with out using muscles. The knee must be unlocked by the femur rotating laterally on tibia (by popliteus) for knee flexion to occur. Law of valgus: Because the femur normally runs slightly obliquely inwards, the Q (quadriceps) angle (i.e. angle that patellar tendon makes relative to shaft of femur) is formed, with its concomitant tendency to pull the patella laterally. This predisposition for lateral motion of patella is referred to as the law of valgus. Since the patella is relatively free to move upon the femur when the knee is extended. When the quadriceps femoris muscle contracts it will try to establish a straight line between its proximal attachment onto the femur & pelvis and its distal attachment onto the tibial tuberosity. Thus the Q angle provides an indication of the lateral force (vector) applied to the patella, which tends to make the patella track laterallyQ in order to establish a straight line relationship between the proximal & distal attachment of quadriceps femoris muscle group during extension. Q (patello-femoral or quadriceps) angle is the angle between the quadriceps muscle, primarily the rectus femoris muscle & the patellar tendon. It is determined by drawing a line from ASIS (anterior superior iliac spine) to the midpoint of patella and from tibial tuberosity to mid point of patella. Although the rectus femoris attaches to AIIS (anterior inferior iliac spine), the ASIS lies just above AIIS and is easier to palpate. Normally it is 13-18deg in knee extension.",

Pain and temperature are carried by lateral spinothalmic tracts, which cross the central pa of the cord sholy after entering the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral side. Fine touch and proprioception are carried in dorsal column fibres which do not cross the cord until medulla. Since fibers conducting pain and temperature sensation cross the cord in the anterior commissure, a lesion in this location will characteristically abolish these modalities on one or both sides over several segments but will spare the tactile sensation (fine touch and proprioception).

'Soap-bubble' appearance - The tumor is homogenously lytic with trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing it, giving rise to a loculated appearance. No calcification within the tumor. None or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor. Coex may be thinned out, or perforated at places. Tumour usually does not enter the adjacent joint.",

The process is: (1) isolation of DNA from parent/child or forensicspecimens using blood, skin, or semen; (2) PCR amplification and radioactive labeling of DNA from variable regions in each sample; (3) separation of the variable DNA fragments by gel electrophoresis; and (4) comparison of the DNA fragment patterns among samples. Since numbers of arrays of repeats of two, three, or four base pairs (microsatellites) may vary from 5 to 100 at a paicular chromosome locus, paicular alleles may occur in less than 1% of the population. As a result, analysis of three loci, each with two alleles, can produce odds as high as (100)6 that the pattern matches a putative father or suspect as compared to a random person from the general population. Reverse transcription based upon RNA-directed DNA synthesis is not utilized in DNA fingerprinting, and the size distribution of undigested DNA reflects its integrity during isolation rather than individual identify. HLA typing uses antibodies to define the constellation of alleles from various loci in the HLA region on chromosome 6. The tendency for ceain HLA alleles to occur together (associate) on the same chromosome as haplotypes greatly reduces their odds of identity when compared to DNA fingerprinting.",

        "exp": "Shouldice repair is a method of hernia repair in which the inguinal floor is strengthened by just approximation of tissue using non-absorbable sutures. No mesh is used.\n\n\nManagement of Groin hernias (mainly inguinal hernia)\u00a0 \nThere are 2 objectives of t/t :\nTreatment of the hernial sac\nIn Indirect hernias, the sac is dissected free from the cord structures and cremastric fibres. The sac is opened and the herniated contents are reduced. Then the sac is ligated at the internal inguinal ring. Alternatively the hernial sac may be invaginated back into the abdomen without ligation.\nDirect sacs are usually too broad based for ligation and should not be opened but instead are simply inverted into the peritoneal cavity.\nInguinal floor reconstruction\n\nManagement of the hernial sac is sufficient for children and young adults, but some method of reconstruction (repair or strengthening) of the inguinal floor is necessary for all adult hernias to prevent recurrence.\n3 broad categories of repair are available\n\n\nPrimary tissue repair\nAnterior tension-free mesh repairs\nPreperitoneal repairs - open & the laparoscopic approach\n\na) Primary tissue repair\n\nIn this method, the post wall of inguinal canal is strengthened by just approximation of tissues with sutures. There is no use of any prosthetic material.\nPrimary repairs without mesh were the mainstay of hernia surgery for decades. The advantages are simplicity of the repair and absence of any foreign body in the groin. Disadvantages include higher recurrence rates due to tension on the repair and a slower return to unrestricted physical activity. Consequently, tension free mesh repairs have now become the dominant method of inguinal hernia repair.\nCommonly performed primary tissue repairs are\n\n\nBassini repair\nHalsted repair\nMcVay (Cooper ligament) repair\nShouldice repair\nDarn repair\n\n\nDarn repair gets its name from the way a long nylon suture repeatedly passed between the tissues to create a weave that one might consider similar to mesh.\n\nAnterior tension-free mesh repair\nRecognizing that tension in a repair is the principal cause of recurrence, current practices in hernia management employ a synthetic mesh prosthesis to bridge the defect\n\nRecurrence rate is quite low with these techniques\nCommon employed techniques are\n\n\u00a0Lichtenstein repair\nIn Lichtenstein repair a piece of polypropylene mesh is used to reconstruct the inguinal floor.\n\nThe mesh is sutured to the abdominal fascia.\nRecurrence rate is quite low\n\nPatch and plug technique\nIn this method, a plug of the mesh is inserted into the hernial defect (i.e. an internal ring in an Indirect hernia) and sutured in place. Then another piece of mesh is placed over the inguinal floor which may or may not be sutured to the fascia.\nLaparoscopic and Preperitoneal repairs\n\nThe laparoscopic hernia repair is based on the technique of 'Stoppa', who used an open preperitoneal approach to reduce the hernia and placed a large piece of mesh to cover the entire inguinal floor and myopectineal orifice. Preperitoneal hernia repairs may also be performed without mesh, but its rarely used now.\nIn Laparoscopic hernia repair, the preperitoneal space is reached by either transabdominal laparoscopy (TAPP) or by a totally extraperitoneal repair (TEP)\nBoth techniques are similar in actual repair but differ in the manner by which the preperitoneal space is accessed.\n\nTAPP (Trans-abdominal pre-peritoneal)\n\nin the TAPP repair, the peritoneal space is entered by conventional laparoscopy and then the preperitoneum overlying the inguinal floor is dissected away as a flap.\n\nTEP (totally extraperitoneal repair)\n\nin TEP repair the preperitoneal space is accessed without entering the peritoneal cavity.\n\nChoice of Anesthesia\n\n\nHere there is a difference of opinion b/w Schwartz Surgery (8/e, p 1368) & Washington Manual of Surgery (4/e, p 511)\n\nAccording to the Washington Manual of Surgery\n\nlocal anaesthesia is the preferred anaesthetic for elective open repair.\nLaparoscopic hernia repair has been carried out under local or regional anaesthesia, but is more commonly done under General anaesthesia.\n\nAccording to Schwartz Surgery\n\nGeneral anaesthesia is the preferred choice for open as well as laparoscopic repair.",

Acute epididymo-orchitis is usually a primary bacterial or rarely a tuberculous infection of the epididymis that has spread to the testicle to involve both structures. Rarely, it can sta in the testicle and spread to the epididymis. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of sexually transmitted disease causing acute epididymitis, though gonococcal is still prevalent. TB epididymitis should be considered when the vas is thickened and there is little response to the ususal antibiotics.

Inguinal floor reconstruction can be needed in children with large hernias.\nComing to option 'c' i.e. \"Surgery should not be done unless patient becomes symptomatic\"\nSurgery can be done even in asymptomatic patients. Let's see this in a little detail as future questions can be asked with little twists in the statement.\nThe decision to repair an asymptomatic hernia or go for 'watchful waiting' has been a matter of many research studies.\nSurgery Vs Watchful waiting:\n\nIt's agreed that the definitive treatment of all hernias, regardless of their origin or type, is surgical repair. Outcomes are generally excellent with minimal short-term morbidity and rapid return to presurgical health. This is true even in elderly individuals, especially with the use of local anesthesia.\nThese surgical outcomes combined with limited outcome data in patients who do not undergo surgery have led to recommendations to offer surgery to most patients with a groin hernia, regardless of symptoms. The risks of delayed surgery are primarily related to the risk of incarceration and strangulation, which are the only true medical indications for repair of hernias. However, it is not possible to identify with any degree of reliability which hernias are likely to incarcerate or strangulate versus those that will remain uncomplicated.\nThe other school of thought favoring Watchful waiting say that: While surgery is clearly indicated for most patients with significant symptoms related to a hernia, it may be reasonable to delay surgery in patients with inguinal hernia who have minimal or no symptoms.\nVarious studies comparing \"watchful waiting\" vs \"immediate surgery in asymptomatic patients\" have found no difference in the rate of hernia accidents and pain scores between the surgery and watchful waiting groups, although patients who had immediate surgery responded that their general health had improved at one year, compared to a perception of health decline in the 'watchful waiting' group.\nThese findings suggest that a strategy of watchful waiting rather than referral for surgery can be considered in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernia, as long as they are aware of the risk, albeit small, of hernia complications and understand the need for prompt medical attention should symptoms of these complications occur.\nAlthough most authors agree that watchful waiting is a safe therapeutic option, some authors suggest elective surgery, rather than watchful waiting, for patients who are elderly, who have limited access to emergency care, or significant illness that would put them at greater risk for poor outcome after bowel strangulation.",

Smoking is the most commonly associated risk factor and accounts for approximately 50% of all bladder cancers. Nitrosamine, 2-naphthylamine, and 4-aminobiphenyl are possible carcinogenic agents found in cigarette smoke. Bladder cancer is also associated with industrial exposure to aromatic amines in dyes, paints, solvents, leather dust, inks, combustion products, rubber, and textiles. Therefore, higher-risk occupations associated with bladder cancer include painting, driving trucks, and working with metal. Several medical risk factors are associated with bladder cancer. Patients with prior exposure to radiation treatment of the pelvis have an increased risk of bladder cancer. Chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide increases the risk of bladder cancer exposure to acrolein, a urinary metabolite of cyclophosphamide. Patients with spinal cord injuries who have long-term indwelling catheters have a 16- to 20-fold increased risk of developing carcinoma of the bladder.

Individual proliferation markers are associated with slightly different phases of the cell cycle and are not equivalent. PCNA and Ki-67 expression are positively correlated with p53 overexpression, high S-phase fraction, aneuploidy, high mitotic index, and high histologic grade in human breast cancer specimens, and are negatively correlated with estrogen receptor content.

Patients sustaining penetrating injuries below the nipples and above the costal margins should be investigated to rule out diaphragmatic injury. Blunt injury to the diaphragm is usually caused by a compressive force applied to the pelvis and abdomen. the diaphragmatic rupture is usually large, with herniation of the abdominal contents into the chest. Herniation occurs as a result of the pressure differential between the thoracic and abdominal cavity. Most diaphragmatic injuries are silent and the presenting features are those of injury to the surrounding organs. The most accurate investigation is by video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) or laparoscopy. Operative repair is recommended in all cases. All penetrating diaphragmatic injury must be repaired via the abdomen and not the chest, to rule out penetrating hollow viscus injury.",
