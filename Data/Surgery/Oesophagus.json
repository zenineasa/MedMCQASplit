(Primary peristalsis is absent or reduced).* The pathogenesis of Achlasia is poorly understood.* It involves:# Neurogenic degeneration either idiopathic or due to infection. The degenerative changes are either intrinsic (degeneration of ganglion cells of Aurebach'smyentric plexus) or extrinsic (extraesophagealvagus nerve or the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus)# Pharmacologic studies suggest dysfunction of inhibitory neurons containing nitric oxideand vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the distal esophagus (LES). The cholinergic innervation of the LES is intact or affected only in advanced disease.* Asa result of the abnormality, the LES fails to relax, primary peristalsis is absent in esophagus which dilates. As the disease progresses the esophagus becomes massively dilated and tortuous.Clinical findings# Both sexes are equally affected # May develop at any age but peak years are from 30 to 60.# Classical clinical symptom is progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Dysphagia is worsened by emotional stress and hurried eating.# Regurgitation and Pulmonary aspiration occur because of retention of large volumes of saliva and ingested food in the esophagus.# Esophagitis with ulceration may occur with chronic retention of food.# Pain is infrequent in classical achlasia but a variant called vigrous achlasia is characterized by chest pain and esophageal spasms that generate non-propuloine high-pressure waves in the body of the esophagus.Diagnosis# Chest x-ray - shows absence of gastric air bubble, an air-fluid level in the mediastinum in the upright position representing retained food in oesophagus.# Barium swallow - shows dilated esophagus with tapering narrowing in the terminal end of esophagus described as 'birds' beak' appearance. Fluoroscopy shows loss of normal peristalsis in the lower two thirds of esophagus.# Endoscopy may be done to rule out any secondary cause of achlasiaeg. carcinoma, stricture at LES.Manometry# It's the most confrmatory investigation# it is able to distinguish between various forms of motor disorders of esophagus# Manometric characteristics of Achlasia* Incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (< 75% relaxation)* Elevated LES pressure* Loss of primary peristaltic waves in the esophageal body, but disorganized muscular activity may be present.* Increased intraesophageal baseline pressure relative to gastric baseline.* Cholecystokinin (CCK) which normally causes a fall in the sphincter pressure, paradoxically causes contraction of the LES (the CCK test).

In addition to laparosocopic myotomy, thoracoscopic myotomy has also been described.Thoracic approach does have certain drawbacks.Heller's Cardiomyotomy - surgical 7-10 cm long incision made through lower oesophageal end & carried over to stomach, muscles are cut till mucosa bulges out. Myotomy should be extended up to aortic arch & distally up to stomach to 1-2 cm below the junction.Forceful dilatation - using Pneumatic Balloon under fluoroscopic control within LOS (300 mmHg pressure applied for 15 sec).Injection Treatment - Injection Botulinum toxin is injected in LES endoscopically, blocks ACh release.Drugs - Sublingual nifedipine gives short term relief.Endoscopic MyotomyLaparoscopic Heller's Myotomy (LHM):Myotomy from 1.5-3 cm distal to the ECJ dividing the longitudinal & oblique muscle to 6-8cm proximal to the ECJ dividing longitudinal & circular muscle of esophagus.Partial fundoplication is routinely performed as incidence of reflux after Heller's myotomy is >50%.It is due to loss of the ganglion cells in the myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus & cause is unknown.Chaga's disease (due to Trypanosoma cruzi) has marked similarities to achalasia.Other Options[?]Hiatus Hernia:True paraoesophageal hernias with cardia remains in its anatomical position are rare.Vast majority of rolling hernias are mixed hernias in which the cardia is displaced into the chest & greater curve of the stomach rolls into the mediastinum.Elective surgery includes reduction of the hernia, excision of the sac, reducing the crural defect & retention of the stomach in the abdomen.[?]Gastro Oesophageal Reflux Disease:Classical triad of symptoms is retrosternal burning pain (heartburn), epigastric pain (sometimes radiating through to the back) and regurgitation.GORD treated by medical management by proton pump inhibitor therapy +H2 receptor antagonists.Surgery includes;1.

Pneumatic dilatation with a 30-mm balloon, the incidence of perforation should be less than 0.5%. The risk of perforation increases with bigger balloons, and they should be used cautiously for progressive dilatation over a period of weeks. Forceful dilatation is curative in 75-85% of cases. The results are best in patients aged more than 45 years. Myotomy is successful in more than 90% of cases and may be used after failed dilatation.

These statistics emphasize both the rarity and lethality of esophageal cancer.* One notable trend is the shift of dominant esophageal cancer type from squamous cell to adenocarcinoma, strongly linked to reflux disease and Barrett's metaplasia.* The typical presentation of esophageal cancer is of progressive solid food dysphagia and weight loss.* Associated symptoms may include odynophagia, iron deficiency, and, with mid-esophageal tumors, hoarseness from left recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Generally, these are indications of locally invasive or even metastatic disease manifest by tracheoesophageal fistulas, and vocal cord paralysis.* Even when detected as a small lesion, esophageal cancer has poor survival because of the abundant esophageal lymphatics leading to regional lymph node metastases.* Benign esophageal tumors are uncommon and usually discovered incidentally. In decreasing frequency of occurrence, cell types include leiomyomas, fibrovascular polyps, squamous papillomas, granular cell, lipomas, neurofibromas, and inflammatory fibroid polyps.* These generally become symptomatic only when they are associated with dysphagia and merit removal only under the same circumstances.",

LB 25th ed., 1024)PARAOESOPHAGEAL ('ROLLING') HIATUS HERNIA# Rolling hiatus hernias are dangerous# Unlike sliding hiatus hernia a rolling hiatus hernia is a true hernia that is prone to complications. True paraoesophageal hernias in which the cardia remains in its normal anatomical position are very rare and confined to museum exhibits and personal collections of interesting cases. The hernia is commonest in the elderly, but may occur in young fit people.# The symptoms of rolling hernia are mostly due to twisting and distortion of the oesophagus and stomach. Dysphagia is common. Chest pain may occur due to distension of an obstructed stomach. Classically the pain is relieved by a loud belch. Symptoms of GORD are variable.# The hernia may be visible on a plain X-ray of the chest as a gas bubble, often with a fluid level behind the heart. Fluid levels are not seen in sliding hernias. A barium meal is the best method of diagnosis. Endoscopic look may be confusing, especially in large hernias endoscopist feels as if have lost sense of direction.# Rolling hernias always require surgical repair as they are potentially dangerous. However, major surgery may not be an attractive prospect in frail elderly patients or in someone who has few symptoms. The essential part of the operation is reduction of the hernia and some form of gastropexy. Some surgeons perform a fundoplication arguing that this is a very effective means of maintaining reduction and that it deals with the associated GORD.# Laparosopic repair has recently become popular. Full anatomical repair of a large rolling hernia can be tedious and difficult by the laparoscopic approach and it is more common simply to reduce the hernia and perform a gastropexy. Some surgeons lay a sheet of prosthetic mesh across the hiatal opening to stop the bowel entering it.# Total or partial fundoplication? The disadvantage of the Nissen fundoplication is that it can produce an overcompetent cardia resulting in dysphagia or the gas bloat syndrome in which belching is prevented. As a result the stomach fills with air and the patient feels very full after meals and passes excessive flatus. The problem of the overcompetent cardia has been largely overcome by the floppy Nissen in which the fundoplication is made very loose around oesophagus and also by making a short fundoplication of 1 cm or so.",
