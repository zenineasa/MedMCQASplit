The differentiating feature of this condition is that the dental occlusion is class III in maximum intercuspation or habitual occlusion, while it is actually class I in centric occlusion. Here the disturbance is a functional one, where as a result of dental interference, the mandible is deviated anteriorly to achieve a \u2018bite of convenience\u2019. Thus, a static evaluation will give a class III reading, but functional examination at postural rest and at first dental contact shows that the mandible is closing in a normal class I way.\nRef:Orthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities\nTHIRD EDITION Om P.

Mammandras found that in women, the upper lip reached its maximum thickness by age 14 and remained the same until 16 years of age, with the lip thinning afterward. In men, maximum lip thickness was attained around age 16 but also began to thin thereafter. The horizontal thickness of the lower lip slowed dramatically but was close to its maximum in both men and women by age 15. Similar results were attained in a study by Nanda et al with mild differences but essentially similar trends.\nRef: Mamandras AH. Linear changes of the maxillary and mandibular lips.

This method is used only when all other test methods are deemed impossible or the results of the other tests are inconclusive.\nAn example of a situation in which this method can be used is when the tooth suspected of having pulpal disease has a full coverage crown. If no sound tooth structure is available to use a bridging technique with the electric pulp tester and\u00a0 cold\u00a0 test\u00a0 results\u00a0 are\u00a0 inconclusive,\u00a0 a\u00a0 small\u00a0 class\u00a0 I\u00a0 cavity preparation is made through the occlusal surface of the crown. This is accomplished with a high-speed #1 or #2 round bur with proper air and water coolant. The patient is not anesthetized\u00a0 while\u00a0 this\u00a0 procedure\u00a0 is\u00a0 performed,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0 patient\u00a0 is asked\u00a0 to\u00a0 respond\u00a0 if\u00a0 any\u00a0 painful\u00a0 sensation\u00a0 is\u00a0 felt\u00a0 during\u00a0 the drilling procedure. If the patient feels pain once the bur contacts sound dentin, the procedure is terminated and the class I cavity preparation is restored. This sensation signifies only that there is some viable nerve tissue remaining in the pulp, not that the pulp is totally healthy. If the patient fails to feel any sensation when the bur reaches the dentin, this is a good indication that the pulp is necrotic and root canal therapy is indicated.\nCohen's Pathway of the Pulp ed:11th Pg20",

        "exp": "Around the age of 8 years, a midline diastema is commonly seen in the upper arch, which is usually misinterpreted by the parents as a malocclusion. Crowns of canines in young jaws impinge on developing lateral incisor roots, thus driving the roots medially and causing the crowns to flare laterally. The roots of the central incisors are also forced together thus causing a maxillary midline diastema. The period from the eruption of lateral incisor to canine is termed as the Ugly Duckling stage. It is an unaesthetic metamorphosis, which eventually leads to an aesthetic result. With eruption of canines, the impingement from the roots shifts incisally thus driving the incisor crowns medially, resulting in closure of the diastema.\nTextbook of Orthodontics, Gurkeerat Singh, 2nd ed\u00a0 Page 40-41",

Dentin in this area is not as hard as normal primary dentin because of mineral loss in the intertubular dentin.\nSuccessful host-defense repair processes result in the remineralization of the intertubular dentin, in addition to the mineral occlusion of the dentinal tubules, such that the final hardness of the dentin in this affected area is greater than normal primary dentin.\nThe increased overall mineralization of this caries-affected primary dentin is referred to as reactive dentin sclerosis.\nDeep dentin formation processes occur simultaneously with the pulpal inflammatory response and result in the generation of tertiary dentin at the pulp\u2013dentin interface. Two types of tertiary dentin form in response to lesion formation.\u00a0\n\nReference: Sturdevant operative dentistry. 7th edition Page no 10",

The strength continues to rise with time and maximum strength is attained\u00a0at the end of 24 hours.\nThe strength of zinc phosphate cement is sufficient when used as a base or luting agent.

Also, the prolonged contact with the oral fluids\u00a0or water gradually reduces its strength.

The\u00a0 hydroxyapatite\u00a0 thus formed\u00a0 increases\u00a0 the\u00a0 concentration\u00a0 of fluoride on\u00a0enamel surface, which in turn makes the tooth surface resistant against caries attack through the action of fluoride.",

        "exp": "Traditionally, dentists have relied upon a visual-tactile radiographic\u00a0 procedure\u00a0 for\u00a0 the detection\u00a0 of\u00a0 dental caries. This procedure involves the visual identification of demineralized\u00a0 areas\u00a0 (typically\u00a0 white\u00a0 spots)\u00a0 or\u00a0 suspicious pits or fissures and the use of the dental explorer to determine the\u00a0 presence of a\u00a0 loss of continuity\u00a0 or breaks in the enamel and to assess the softness or resilience of the enamel. Caries lesions located on interproximal tooth surfaces\u00a0 have\u00a0 generally\u00a0 been\u00a0 detected\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 use\u00a0 of\u00a0 bitewing radiographs. These procedures have been used routinely in virtually every dental office in the United States for the past 50 years. Tactile probing with an explorer is no longer used for caries detection in most European countries, and this protocol has now been adopted by many U.S. dental schools. The primary concerns that led to the discontinuation of the probing procedure were as follows:\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 the\u00a0 insertion\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 explorer\u00a0 into\u00a0 the\u00a0 suspected lesion inevitably disrupts the surface layer covering very early lesions, thereby eliminating the possibility for remineralization of the decalcified area; (2) the probing of lesions and suspected lesions results in the transport of\u00a0 cariogenic\u00a0 bacteria\u00a0 from\u00a0 one area\u00a0 to another;\u00a0 and\u00a0 (3) frank lesions requiring restoration are generally apparent visually\u00a0 without\u00a0 the\u00a0 need\u00a0 for\u00a0 probing.",
