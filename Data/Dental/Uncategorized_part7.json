The tube is then placed in a storage bath at 65\u00b0C to retain the sol condition until it is needed. For the immediate\u00a0preparation\u00a0step,\u00a0the\u00a0impression\u00a0tray\u00a0is\u00a0filled\u00a0with hydrocolloid sol from the tube taken from the storage bath, a gauze pad is placed over the top of the tray material, and the tray is placed in the water-filled tempering compartment (at about 45\u00b0C) of the conditioning unit.

In any case,\u00a0the loaded tray should never be left in this bath for more than 10 minutes as partial gelation can occur, thereby making the material unusable.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 170",

This reaction has become possible because the solubility of hemihydrate in water is four times greater than that of the dihydrate near room temperature. Thus, the setting reactions occur as follows:\n\nWhen the hemihydrate is mixed with water, a suspension is formed that is fluid and workable.\nThe hemihydrate dissolves until it forms a saturated solution of Ca2+\u00a0 and (SO4)2\u2212.\nThis saturated hemihydrate solution is supersaturated with respect to the solubility of the dihydrate; precipitation of dihydrate occurs.\n\nKey Concept:\nSetting reaction has become possible because the solubility of hemihydrate in water is four times greater than that of the dihydrate near room temperature.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 183",

This form of abuse is different from all other forms of child maltreatment in that the medical community is unwittingly a part of the abuse. Because health care providers are often dependent on the parental history of the child\u2019s illness, it takes some time for the practitioner to realize the inconsistencies and possibly fabricated or exaggerated nature of the complaints. These children often present with persistent and recurrent illnesses that cannot be explained and signs and symptoms that do not clinically make sense. The\u00a0 motivation of the perpetrators of this form of abuse can be multifactorial (e.g., to gain medical attention, as a result of parental psychosis, or to obtain money or services) but is not considered in the making of a diagnosis of medical child abuse.

Molten platinum and palladium have a strong affinity for hydrogen as well as oxygen. On solidification, the absorbed gases are expelled and pinhole porosity results. The larger voids may also result from the same cause, but it is more logical to assume that such voids are caused by gas that is mechanically trapped by the molten metal in the mold or by gas that is incorporated during the casting procedure.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 226",

Lingual crossbite occurs when the maxillary buccal cusp(s) is/are lingual to the buccal cusp tip(s) of the opposing mandibular tooth. Brodie defined a malocclusion as a \"Brodie bite\" or \"Brodie syndrome\" when the lower jaw \"telescoped\" within the maxillary arch (i.e. the mandibular teeth were completely contained within the maxillary arch). The first consideration for scissor bite correction is to determine, if orthognathic surgery is necessary.\nBrodie Syndrome/bite is a rare form of transverse malocclusion. It was named after Allan G. Brodie, who was the first author to present the case of a patient with this malocclusion in 1952.\u00a0\nOther names can be found in the literature: Brodie bite, exaggerated occlusion, or even scissors bite.\nRef: Brodie AG.

This obligate space is provided by:\n\nInterdental physiologic spacing in the primary incisor region: 4 mm in maxillary arch; 3 mm in\u00a0mandibular arch.\nIncrease in the intercanine arch width: Signi\ufb01cant amount of growth occurs with the eruption of\u00a0incisors and canines.\nIncrease in the anterior length of the dental arches: Permanent incisors erupt labial to the primary\u00a0incisors to obtain an added space of 2-3 mm.\nChange in inclination of permanent incisors: Primary teeth are upright, but permanent teeth incline to the labial surface, thus decreasing the inter-incisal angle from about 150o in the\u00a0deciduous dentition to 123o in the permanent dentition. This increases the arch perimeter.\n\nTextbook of Orthodontics, Gurkeerat Singh, 2nd ed\u00a0Page 45-46",

Any deviation from such principles leads to immediate failure. These essential condensation principles are as follows:\n\nThe forces of condensation must be at 45o to cavity walls and floors. In other words, they should bisect line angles and trisect point angles. This leads to the maximum adaptation of gold against walls, floors, line, and point angles, with minimal irritation to the vital pulp-dentin organ.\nForces of condensation must be directed\u00a0 at 90o to previously condensed gold. This avoids shear components that can displace or loosen the already condensed pieces of gold.\nWhenever condensing a piece of direct gold, always start at a point on one side and proceed in a straight line to another point on the opposite side, then back to the original side on a different straight line, also starting at and arriving to a specific point. This ensures that the condenser has covered the entire surface of that\u00a0 piece of gold. During these disciplined movements, the condenser should overlap at least \u00bc of the previously condensed area. This further assures that each portion of the gold increment has been welded and cold worked and cold worked and that there are no voids present. This process, called \u201cstepping\u201d ensures the maximal adaptation of the gold to the cavity walls.\nUse the minimal thickness of pellet possible, provided that the condensers will not penetrate it.

Although such reducing fluxes are excellent for cleaning old alloy, a better flux for the casting procedure may be made from equal parts of fused borax powder ground with boric acid powder. The boric acid aids in retaining the borax on the surface of the alloy. The flux is added when the alloy is completely melted and should be used with both old and new alloy.

He inferred that when a solid is caused to flow, as in polishing due to heat generated, the crystalline surface is broken down to form a harder and denser surface layer.The Beilby layer explains the hardening of metals under cold working. This worked layer thus can be defined as an amorphous, disorganized molecular surface layer of a highly polished metal, which is a result of melting and surface flow during machining of the molecular layers such as using a series of\u00a0abrasives of decreasing coarseness during the polishing processes.\nMaterials Used in Dentistry-\u00a0 S.

In addition, causal relationships have been established between cerebral palsy and complications of labor or delivery; infections of the brain, such as meningitis and encephalitis; toxemias of pregnancy; congenital defects of the brain; kernicterus; poisoning with certain drugs and heavy metals; and accidents resulting in trauma to the head.

The mold may actually become smaller rather than larger because of the reverse pressure resulting from the confinement of the setting expansion. This effect can be overcome by using a split ring or flexible rubber ring that permits the setting expansion of the investment.\nHowever, the most commonly used technique to provide investment expansion is to line the walls of the ring with a ring liner. Traditionally, asbestos was the material of choice, but it can no longer be used because its carcinogenic potential makes it a biohazard. \nTwo types of nonasbestos ring liner materials have been produced: an aluminosilicate ceramic liner and a cellulose (paper) liner.\nTo ensure uniform expansion, the clinician or technician cuts the liner to fit the inside diameter of the casting ring with no overlap.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 215",

It also contains a catalyst and stabilizers. Its color is white so that, for aesthetic reasons, it is more acceptable than amalgam. According to the first research reports, Ariston is releasing three different types of ions (fluoride, calcium, hydroxyl). The release of these ions depends on the pH value. When the pH value in the oral cavity is low due to active plaque, Ariston releases significantly higher amounts of ions than it does with neutral pH values.\nThe ion effects are as follows:\n\nFluoride ions hamper demineralization, promote remineralization and inhibit bacterial growth.\nCalcium ions hamper demineralization and promote remineralization.\nHydroxyl ions neutralize the acid produced by cariogenic bacteria and inhibit bacterial growth.\n\nRef: Kukletov\u00e1 M, Kuklov\u00e1 J, Christoforidis G.

Space for the light-body \u201cwash\u201d material is provided either by cutting away some of the \u201ctray\u201d putty or by using a thin polyethylene sheet as a spacer between the putty and the prepared teeth during preliminary impression making.

A mixture of the thin-consistency wash material is placed into the putty impression and on the preparation; then the tray is reseated in the mouth to make the final impression.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 159,160",

Complete debridement of canal should be done with adjunctive use of irrigants like sodium hypochlorite, which efficiently removes bacteria as well as their substrate from irregularities of canal system, where instruments cannot reach such as fins, indentations, cul\u00a0de-sacs, etc.\nOxygenating a canal simply by opening it is detrimental to anaerobes. Use of oxygenating agents as glyoxide can be of great help, but care should be taken to avoid the inoculation of these oxygenating agents into periapical tissues.\u00a0\nA tooth with serous or purulent or hemorrhagic exudate should be allowed to drain with rubber dam in place for a time under supervision. An abscess which is a potent irritant, has an elevated osmotic pressure. This attracts more tissue fluid and thus more edema and pain. Drainage by canal or by soft tissues decrease discomfort caused by inflammatory mediators.\u00a0\nAntibiotics should also be considered as adjunctive in severe infections. The choice of antibiotic agent should be done on the knowledge of microorganisms associated with endodontic infections.\u00a0\nIntracanal medicaments play an important role in\u00a0combating the microorganisms.",

Tonic labyrinthine reflex. If the patient\u2019s head suddenly falls backward while the patient is supine, the back may assume the position known as postural extension; the legs and arms straighten out, and the neck and back arch.\n3. Startle reflex. This reflex, which is frequently observed in persons with cerebral palsy, consists of sudden, involuntary, often forceful bodily movements.\u00a0 This reaction is produced when the patient is surprised by stimuli, such as sudden noises or unexpected movements by other people.\u00a0\nNote: \nParachute reflex appears at 6-9 months and persists throughout life.\nClinical importance: it is either absent or abnormal in spastic form of cerebral palsy.",

Such a bonded composite build-up restoration allows for the preservation of all sound\u00a0tooth structure and depends on the presence of some enamel surfaces to provide bonded retention\u00a0for the restorative material. Any soft defective areas are excavated, but little or no additional tooth\u00a0preparation is done. Usually even undermined enamel surfaces are preserved for additional retention\u00a0 and support of the restorative material.",

Crowns of canines in young jaws impinge on developing lateral incisor roots, thus driving the roots medially and causing the crowns to flare laterally. The roots of the central incisors are also forced together, thus causing a maxillary midline diastema. The period from the eruption of lateral incisor to canine is termed as the Ugly Duckling stage.\u00a0It is an unaesthetic metamorphosis, which eventually leads to an aesthetic result. With eruption of canines, the impingement from the roots shifts incisally, thus driving the incisor crowns medially, resulting in closure of the diastema.\nTextbook of Orthodontics, Gurkeerat Singh, 2nd Ed, pg-46",
