Gingival hyperplasia is likely to be a problem, and the hormonal\u00a0 variations in pregnancy sometimes can lead to surprising results from otherwise predictable\u00a0 treatment procedures. Because of bone turnover issues during pregnancy and lactation, an\u00a0 orthodontist theoretically should be vigilant about loss of alveolar bone and root resorption at\u00a0 these time-but radiographs to check on the status of bone and tooth roots are not permissible\u00a0 during pregnancy. Treatment for a potential patient who is already pregnant should be\u00a0 deferred until the pregnancy is completed. If a patient becomes pregnant during treatment,\u00a0 the possible problems should be discussed, and it is wise to place her in a holding pattern\u00a0 during the last trimester, limiting the amount of active tooth movement.\nRef: Proffit-4th ed pg no 319",

        "exp": "The Babinski sign, indicating an upper motor neuron lesion, is characterized by extension of the great toe and fanning of the remaining toes. Too vigorous stimulation may produce withdrawal, which may be misinterpreted as a Babinski sign. Plantar responses have limited diagnostic utility in neonates, because they are mediated by several competing reflexes and can be either flexor or extensor, depending on how the foot is positioned. Asymmetry of the reflexes or plantar response is a useful lateralizing sign in infants and children.\u00a0\nNote: \nThe Babinski sign can be elicited by stroking the sole of the foot with a firm stimulus. The normal adult response is plantar-flexion. The sign is positive when the application of the stimulus elicits extension of the large toe and fanning of the other toes. The Babinski sign is known to be a normal response in infants before full maturation of the corticospinal tract. However, in adults, a positive sign is indicative of underlying UMN damage. Other reflexes exist which represent lesions of the corticospinal tract. The Brissaud reflex is linked with the extensor response of the Babinski sign and is positive when stroking the sole of the foot elicits contraction of the tensor fascia latae of the ipsilateral leg. The Hoffman sign is an analog of the Babinski reflex for the upper limbs. The test is performed by loosely holding the patient\u2019s middle finger and quickly flicking the fingernail downward. A positive sign is the flexion and adduction of the thumb.\nDamage anywhere along the Corticospinal Tract can result in the presence of a Babinski sign.",

Often, teeth are extracted for decompensation.\nDecompensation makes the maxillomandibular dental relation temporarily worse. Hence, it is sometimes called \u201cReverse Orthodontics\u201d.",

On activation, photoinitiator (camphorquinone) combines with amine accelerator and releases free radicals which start the polymerization. Different types of lights used in curing are:\n\nTungsten-quartz halogen (QTH) curing unit\nPlasma arc curing (PAC) unit\nLight emitting diode (LED) unit\nArgon laser curing unit\nTungsten-quartz halogen (QTH) curing unit is conventional and most commonly used curing light for composite resins. It is an incandescent lamp, which uses visible light in the wavelength in the range of 410 to 500 nm and intensity of 400-900 mW/cm2.\nPlasma Arc Curing has a high-frequency electrical field, which is generated using high voltage. This field ionizes the xenon gas into a mixture of ions, electrons and molecules, thereby releasing energy in the form of plasma. Hence, it is applicable for usage in deeper areas cause of the high-intensity light more than 1800 mW/cm2 curing cycle in 6 to 9 seconds.\nLight Emitting Diode unit usually have a long life and emits powerful blue light. This light falls in a narrow wavelength range of 455 nm to 486 nm. This corresponds to the range of camphorquinone photoinitiator found in most of the composite resins.\nArgon laser light has a wavelength of 470 nm, which is monochromatic in nature.

The crown is removed from the tooth and the overlapped material repositioned and welded. A small amount of solder is flowed over the outside margin.

The crown may be cut on the buccal or lingual surface. After the crown has been adapted to the prepared tooth, an additional piece of 0.004-inch stainless steel band material may be welded into place.

When ammoniacal silver nitrate is used, silver deposits penetrate the hybrid layer formed by either etch-and-rinse or self-etch adhesive materials. Penetration of ammoniacal silver nitrate results in two distinct patterns of nanoleakage:\n\nA spotted pattern in the hybrid layer of self-etch adhesives, which might be caused by incomplete resin infiltration.\u00a0\nA reticular pattern that occurs in the adhesive layer, most likely caused by areas where water was not totally removed from the bonding area.\n\nThe term \u201cwater trees\u201d is associated with porosities in the polymerized adhesive layer. Silver uptake in hybrid layers formed by one-step SEAs is associated with areas of increased permeability within the polymerized resin from which water was incompletely removed.

Absence of proper interdigitation during transitional dentition also contributes to bruxism.\nVarious systemic factors such as worm infestations, sub-clinical nutritional de\ufb01ciencies, magnesium de\ufb01ciency, allergies and endocrinal disorders have also been attributed.\nBruxomania is associated with certain cortical lesions of the CNS.\n\nRef: Textbook of orthodontics Gowrishankar 1st\u00a0ed page no 557",

This DCPD is highly reactive with fluoride ion and starts forming immediately when APF is applied.\nFluoride penetrates into the crystals more deeply through the openings produced by shrinkage and leads to formation of fluorapatite.\nFor the conversion of whole of DCPD so formed into fluorapatite, deeper penetration and continuous supply of fluoride is required. Because of this reason, APF is applied every\u00a0 30 seconds and the teeth has to be kept wet for 4 minutes.\u00a0\nBecause high fluoride concentration and low pH favor fluoride deposition, acidification of the fluoride solution with phosphoric acid was found to suppress the dissolution of enamel, as well as the formation of calcium fluoride and provide a more effective treatment.\u00a0\nThe intermediate product formed is the dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and calcium fluoride is the principal reaction product.\n\n\u200bEssentials of preventive and community dentistry\u00a0\nSoben Peter\u00a0\n5th edition",

        "exp": "Biomechanical Considerations\nThe maxilla can be advanced 2-4 mm forward over a period of 8-12 months. The amount of maxillary movement is influenced by a number of factors like:\n\nAmount of force:\u00a0 Successful maxillary protraction can be brought about by 300-500 gm of force per side in the primary or mixed dentition.\nDirection of force: According to most authors, a 15- 20\u00b0 downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.\u00a0\n\tIn most cases of maxillary deficiency, maxilla is deficient in the vertical plane as well, therefore, a slight downward, direction of force is usually desirable. The line of force passes below the center of resistance of the maxilla producing a counter-clockwise moment on the maxilla and dentition. This results in a possible extrusion of maxillary posterior teeth leading to a downward and backward rotation of the mandible.\n\tHowever, in patients with increased anterior facial height, downward pull is contradicted.\nDuration of force:\u00a0A review of literature shows duration to vary between 3 and 16 months. On an average at least 8-12 months of wear is required to produce the desired effect.\nFrequency of use:\u00a012-14 hrs/day\n\nKey Concept:\nSuccessful maxillary protraction can be brought about by\u00a0300-500 gm of force per side\u00a0in the primary or mixed dentition.\nReference: Textbook of orthodontics 2nd\u00a0ed Gurkeerat Singh page no 502",

Thus the concept of HDI reflects achievements in the most basic human capabilities, viz, leading a long life, being knowledgeable and enjoying a decent standard of living. Hence, these three variables have been chosen to represent those dimensions. The HDI is a more comprehensive measure than per capita income. Income is only a means to human development, not an end.

Black described a way to name dental instruments which is similar to zoological classification:\n\nThe order denotes the purpose of the instrument, e.g., excavator, scaler.\nThe suborder denotes the position or manner of use of the instrument, e.g., push, pull.\nThe class describes the form of the blade, e.g., hatchet, chisel.\nThe angle denotes the number of angles in the shank. If the instrument contains one angle in its shank, it is called monangle. If it contains two angles, it is called binangle. If it contains three angles, it is called triple-angle. Four angles are called quaternary-angle.\nNaming of the instruments usually moves from 4 to 1.\n\nFor example, a binangle hatchet push excavator. In most cases, the suborder describing the position or manner of use is variable and non-specific, and for practical purposes, it is usually omitted. Identifying the working end and the purpose of the instrument is sufficient, e.g., binangle hatchet excavator.\nRef: Sturdevant's art and science of operative dentistry. 4th edition page 309\nOperative dentistry modern theory and practice Marzouk page 59",
