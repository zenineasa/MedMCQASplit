Characteristically, they are isolated and deep, though they may occur as regular lines or grid-like pattern. The nail is dull, rough, and fragile The nail bed may have \"oil\" spots, which are oval, salmon-coloured nail beds, and there may be onycholysis secondary to \"oil\" spots affecting hyponychium medially or laterally. Secondary infections may occur. The nail plate may become raised off the hyponychium (subungual hyperkeratosis). The most frequent signs of nail matrix disease are pitting, leukonychia, crumbling, and red spots in the lunula, whereas salmon patches or oil spots, subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, and splinter hemorrhages represent changes of nail bed psoriasis Ref: Harrison 19e pg: 347; Fitzpatrick dermatology",

The most common variety of psoriasis is called plaque-type. The other types are guttate psoriasis, inverse or flexural psoriasis ,pustular psoriasis, scalp psoriasis, palmoplantar psoriasis, nail psoriasis. Inverse psoriasis affects the interiginous regions, including the axilla, groin, submammary region, and navel; it also tends to affect the scalp, palms, and soles. Guttate psoriasis (eruptive psoriasis) is most common in children and young adults. It develops acutely in individuals without psoriasis or in those with chronic plaque psoriasis. Patients present with many small erythematous, scaling papules, frequently after upper respiratory tract infection with b-hemolytic streptococci pustular psoriasis, patients may have disease localized to the palms and soles, or the disease may be generalized. Regardless of the extent of disease, the skin is erythematous, with pustules and variable scale. Localized to the palms and soles, it is easily confused with eczema. Ref: Harrison 19e pg: 347",
