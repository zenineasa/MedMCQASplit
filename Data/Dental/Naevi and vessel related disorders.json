The facial haemangiomas most characteristically take the form of extensive plaques, that appear to occupy one or more facial dermatomes, and they may initially be mistaken for po-wine stains. They may be either unilateral or bilateral. Ulceration is common. The commonest posterior fossa abnormality is the Dandy-Walker syndrome, but other abnormalities have included arachnoid cyst, cerebellar atrophy with enlarged cisterna magna and fouh ventricle, cerebellar atrophy with vermis agenesis, and agenesis of the corpus callosum. These posterior fossa abnormalities may be reflected clinically by macrocephaly, enlarging head circumference, hemiparesis, developmental delay, or may be found on imaging in the absence of symptoms.Ipsilateral intracranial haemangiomas may also occur; they are generally asymptomatic and appear to regress spontaneously in parallel with associated extracranial lesions. These patients may also have cardiac anomalies, paicularly coarctation of the aoa, pharyngeal or laryngeal haemangioma, a wide variety of eye abnormalities, including glaucoma, and ventral developmental defects, most characteristically sternal clefting or a supraumbilical raphe.",
