        "exp": "Late mesial shift\nThe second transitional period is completed with the eruption of second molars at the age of 12 years. In this period, class I permanent molar occlusion is achieved by a late mesial shift of the mandibular permanent molars. The difference in the combined mesiodistal dimensions of the primary canine, first and second molar in each quadrant is greater than the combined mesio-distal dimensions of the permanent premolars and canine. This excess of space, i.e, Leeway space is greater in the mandibular arch as compared to the maxillary arch. The erupting permanent molars migrate mesially in the occlusal path, more mesial in the mandible and thereby establishing a Class I cusp to fossa relationship. These movements transform the straight terminal plane relationship of primary molars into a mesial step relationship. This phenomenon occurs mostly with closed primary dentition, where interdental spaces do not exist and primary second molars are in a straight terminal plane relationship. In this condition, an early mesial shift is not possible. The permanent maxillary, mandibular first molars emerge into a cusp-to-cusp relationship, but move to a class I relationship later. This change has been referred to as the late mesial shift. The late mesial shift is facilitated with the use of leeway space.\nOP Kharbanda 2nd ED",

All intermediate phases in the alloy are changed to a disordered solid solution\u00a0 at\u00a0 700\u00b0C,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0 rapid\u00a0 quenching\u00a0 prevents\u00a0 ordering\u00a0from occurring during cooling. The tensile strength, proportional limit, and hardness are reduced by such a treatment, and the ductility is increased. To harden the alloy, the temperature of the furnace is set between 200\u00b0C and 450\u00b0C and the casting is heated for 15 to 30 minutes before it is quenched in water. Ideally, before the alloy is age-hardened, it should be subjected to a softening heat treatment to relieve all residual strain hardening before the alloy is hardened again by heat treatment to produce a disordered solid solution.\u00a0 Otherwise\u00a0 the\u00a0 amount\u00a0 of\u00a0 solid-state\u00a0 transformation\u00a0 will not be properly controlled.

        "exp": "The Wits analysis was conceived primarily as a way to overcome the limitations of ANB as an indicator of jaw discrepancy. It is based on a projection of points A and B to the occlusal plane, along which the linear difference between these points is measured. If the anteroposterior position of the jaws is normal, the projections from points A and B will intersect the occlusal plane at very nearly the same point. The magnitude of a discrepancy in the Class II direction can be estimated by how many millimeters the point A projection is in front of the point B projection, and vice versa for Class III. The Wits analysis, in contrast to the Harvold analysis, is influenced by the teeth both horizontally and vertically. Horizontally because points A and B are somewhat influenced by the dentition and vertically because the occlusal plane is determined by the vertical position of the teeth. It is important for Wits analysis that the functional occlusal plane, drawn along the maximum intercuspation of the posterior teeth, be used rather than an occlusal plane influenced by the vertical position of the incisors. Even so, this approach fails to distinguish skeletal discrepancies from problems caused by displacement of the dentition or specify which jaw is at fault if there is a skeletal problem, and if the Wits analysis is used, these limitations must be kept in mind.\nRef: Contemporary orthodontics, William Proffit, 4th edition page 212",

This may be due to their inability to maintain good oral hygiene, due to the parent's tendency to overindulge them with soft and cariogenic food, and to the increased prevalence of enamel hypoplastic defects on their teeth.\nPeriodontal Disease\nOccurs with a great frequency, as the patient is unable to brush or floss adequately. Due to difficulty in chewing and swallowing, children tend to eat soft foods that are high in carbohydrates. They may also be on phenytoin to control seizure activity which is a cause of some degree of gingival hyperplasia.\nMalocclusions\nOccurs twice as often than in the average population. Commonly noticed\u00a0are protrusion of the maxillary anterior teeth, excessive overjet and overbite, open bites and unilateral cross-bites, the cause being the disharmonious relationship between intraoral and perioral musculature. In spastics, Class II div 2 malocclusion is observed, along with constricted maxillary and mandibular arches. In the athetoid group, Class II div 1 malocclusion is seen along with a high and narrow palatal vault.\nBruxism\nCommonly seen in athetoid cerebral palsy resulting in severe attrition, loss of vertical dimension and temporomandibular joint disorders.\nTrauma\nDue to the nature of disorder, these children are susceptible to trauma, especially of the maxillary anterior teeth.\n\nChildren may have excessive drooling and difficulty in swallowing.\nSpastic cerebral palsy patients present with spastic tongue thrust, constricted mandibular and maxillary arches, Class II div II malocclusion (75%) usually with a unilateral crossbite.\nAthetoid cerebral palsy patients present\u00a0with a mouth breathing, tongue protruding between the teeth and the lips, bruxism, high narrow palate and anterior open bite.\n\nPediatric Dentistry / Shobha Tandon - 2nd Ed\u00a0 P: 543",

The degree of pulp bleeding upon exposure is a more reliable tool to judge the status of the pulp than the preoperative clinical signs and symptoms.\u00a0\nContinued bleeding after minutes, even after rinsing with sodium hypochlorite solution, may suggest that the residual pulp was still heavily inflamed and a complete pulpectomy may be a more effective treatment modality. Removal of infected tissue is a matter of subjective experience but may be aided by various dyes. The final factor relies on the correct choice of restorative material and its adequate manipulation to prevent leakage.\n\u00a0\nReference: Cohen Pathways of Pulp 11th ed page no 495",

It is recommended for use, when considerable wire bending is needed such as multiple loop wires.\nYellow (ductile): It is more resilient than blue elgiloy, but can also be bent with relative ease.\nGreen (semi-resilient): It is more resilient than yellow.\nRed (resilient): Red Elgiloy wire is the hardest and most resilient elgiloy and provides high spring qualities. Careful manipulation is recommended when using this wire because it withstands only minimal working.

This is the most widely used classification.\nClass I: Philososphical patients\n\nThey are rational and composed in difficult situations.\nThey desire treatment for maintenance of health and appearance and accept the complete denture treatment as a normal procedure.\nThey learn to adjust rapidly.\nThese patients have the best mental attitude for acceptance of the treatment.\n\nClass II: Exacting patients\n\nThey are very methodical, precise and accurate, making severe demands.\nThey are comfortable when each procedure is explained and discussed with them in details.\nThey require extreme care, effort and patience on part of the dentist.\nThe intelligent and understanding category in this class can be the best type of patient, but for those lacking the same, extra time should be spent in education and treatment started only after an understanding is reached.\n\nClass III: Indifferent patients\n\nThese patients are identified by their lack of concern and motivation and apathetic attitude.\nThey may not pay any attention to instructions, will not cooperate and are prone to blame others including the dentist for their poor health. In many cases, the lack of interest on part of the patient is the reason for their edentulousness.\nA patient education programme is recommended before treatment.\nIf their interest cannot be stimulated, it may be best to refuse such patients.\nThey present a questionable or unfavourable prognosis.\n\nClass IV: Hysterical patients\n\nThey are emotionally unstable, excitable and apprehensive.\nThey may not be aware that their symptoms may be more related to their systemic health.\nThey often present an unfavourable prognosis and additional psychiatric counselling is required prior to the treatment.\n\nKey Concept:\nThe patients classified under philosophical category desire treatment for maintenance of health and appearance and accept the complete denture treatment as a normal procedure. They learn to adjust rapidly. Such patients have the best mental attitude for acceptance of the treatment.\nRef: Textbook of prosthodontics V Rangarajan Ed. 2nd",

Almost all authorities recognize that persistent digit-sucking habits extending into the incisor transition period can cause a malocclusion or aggravate an already existing one. Pressure generated from the habit can produce changes in the anterior segments of the dental arches, with labial flaring and protrusive spacing of maxillary anterior teeth and increased overjet. Remodeling of the maxillary alveolar process and vertical displacement of the maxillary anterior teeth can result in an open-bite relationship.",

The object fully recovers its original shape when the force is removed. Plastic strain represents a permanent deformation of the material; it does not decrease when the force is removed. When a prosthetic component such as a clasp arm on a partial denture is deformed past the elastic limit into the plastic deformation region, elastic plus plastic deformation has occurred, but only the elastic strain is recovered when the force is released. Thus, when an adjustment is made by bending an orthodontic wire, a margin of a metal crown, or a denture clasp, the plastic strain is permanent but the wire, margin, or clasp springs back a certain amount as elastic strain recovery occurs.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 48,51",

The guidelines all acknowledge that, in some cases, radiographs are not possible, in which case, one should balance the benefit against the risk even more carefully. Sometimes it is better to postpone the radiographic exposure until the patient is older or better conditioned. The guidelines also clearly state that if there are no clinical signs of pathology, the need for a radiographic assessment is up to the professional\u2019s judgment, and that these decisions have to be made on an individual patient basis.

        "exp": "In patients with a bilateral cleft, the premaxillary segment is often displaced anteriorly while the posterior maxillary segments are lingually collapsed behind it. If this distortion is severe, surgical closure of lip, will become extremely difficult. So orthodontic intervention to reposition the segments and to bring the protruding premaxillary segment back into the arch may be needed to obtain a good surgical repair of lip. This is achieved by \"infant orthopedics\".\nInfant orthopedics was pioneered by Burston. In a child with bilateral cleft, the maxillary segment requires two movements i.e., lateral expansion and posterior reposition. This movement is accomplished by a Light elastic strap across anterior segment. In infants, the segments can be repositioned surprisingly, quickly and easily, so that the period of active treatment is only a few weeks at most. If pre-surgical movement of maxillary segment is needed, this typically would be done beginning at 3 to 6 weeks of age, so that the lip closure could be carried out approximately 10 weeks. A passive plate similar to an orthodontic retainer is then used for a few months after lip closure.",

It\u00a0 uses\u00a0 a\u00a0 diode\u00a0 laser light source and a fibreoptic cable that transmits the light to a handheld probe with a fibreoptic eye in the tip. The light is absorbed and induces infrared fluorescence by organic and inorganic material. The emitted fluorescence is collected\u00a0 at the probe tip, transmitted through\u00a0 ascending\u00a0 fibres,\u00a0 and\u00a0 processed\u00a0 and\u00a0 presented on a display window as an integer between 0 and 99. Increased\u00a0 fluorescence\u00a0 reflects\u00a0 potential\u00a0 caries-affected tooth substance. The identity of the material responsible that DIAGNOdent is capable of detecting relatively advanced caries lesions, and DIAGNOdent readings show a very good correlation with histologic evidence of caries, but not with the depths of the lesions in dentin.\nConventional clinical caries examinations routinely use transillumination to identify lesions located on the interproximal surfaces of the anterior teeth. For at least\u00a0 30 years a fibreoptic transillumination (FOTI) instrument has been available for clinical use. It provides an intense light beam that is transmitted through a fibreoptic cable to a specially designed probe to permit the use of transillumination on the proximal surfaces of posterior teeth, Repeated improvements have been made in the instrument so that it may be used on occlusal and proximal tooth surfaces and the instrument is commonly used, often in place of radiographs, in private practices in Europe.",

Each succeeding step of the condenser overlaps (by half) the previous one as the condenser is moved toward the periphery. The gold moves under the nib face of the condenser, effecting compaction as malleting proceeds.\nThe most efficient compaction occurs directly under the nib face. Some compaction also occurs by lateral movement of the gold against surrounding preparation walls. The result of compaction is to remove most of the void space from within each increment of gold, to compact the gold into line and point angles and against walls, and to attach it to any previously placed gold via the process of cohesion. The line of force is important when any gold is compacted. The line of force is the direction through which the force is delivered (i.e., the direction in which the condenser is aimed).\u00a0\nThus improper stepping of the condenser point leads to voids (pitting) of direct gold restorations.\nRef: Sturdevant operative dentistry 7 ed page no e72",

        "exp": "A discoid\u2013cleoid instrument may be used to carve the occlusal surface of an amalgam restoration. The rounded end (discoid) is positioned on the unprepared enamel adjacent to the amalgam margin and pulled parallel to the margin. This removes any excess at the margin while not allowing the marginal amalgam to be carved below the preparation margins (i.e., \u201csubmarginated\u201d).\nThe pointed end (cleoid) of the instrument may be used to define the primary grooves, fossae, and cuspal inclines. The Hollenback carver is also useful for carving these areas.The reproduction of grooves and fossae is necessary to provide appropriate mastication and sluiceways for the escape of food from the occlusal table. The mesial and distal fossae are carved to be inferior to the marginal ridge height, helping limit the potential for food to be wedged into the occlusal embrasure. Having rounded and relatively shallow occlusal anatomy also helps achieve a 90-degree amalgam margin on the occlusal surface and to ensure adequate occlusogingival dimension of the final amalgam restoration for strength.\nOcclusal embrasure areas are developed with a thin explorer\u00a0tip or carving instrument by mirroring the contours of the adjacent\u00a0tooth. The explorer tip is pulled along the inside of the matrix\u00a0band, creating the occlusal embrasure form.",

It is further emphasized that significant wall contact should be avoided in the crown-down phase to reduce hydrostatic pressure and the possibility of blockage. Several studies demonstrated more centered preparations in teeth with curved root canals shaped with a modified double-flare technique and Flex-R files compared to shapes prepared with K-files and step-back technique.\u00a0\nA double-flare technique was also suggested for ProFile rotary instruments.",

When responding to initial caries demineralization events, crystalline material precipitates in intratubular and intertubular dentin.

This zone can be seen even before the demineralization reaches the dentin and it may not be present in rapidly advancing lesions.

        "exp": "-DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDUAL COMPRESSIVE STRESSES\nThe fabrication of metal-ceramic and all-ceramic prostheses usually involves sintering the ceramic at high temperature or\u00a0hot-pressing a veneering ceramic onto the metal or core ceramic. The process of cooling to room temperature offers the opportunity to take advantage of mismatches in coefficients of thermal contraction of adjacent materials in the ceramic structure.\u00a0\n-MINIMIZING THE NUMBER OF FIRING CYCLES\nThe purpose of porcelain firing procedures is to densely\u00a0sinter the particles of powder together and produce a relatively smooth, glassy layer (glaze) on the surface. In some cases a stain layer is applied for shade adjustment or for characterization, such as stain lines or fine cracks.\u00a0\n-ION EXCHANGE\nThe technique of ion exchange is an effective\u00a0method of introducing residual compressive stresses into the surface of a ceramic.\u00a0\n-THERMAL TEMPERING\nPerhaps the most common method for strengthening glasses is by thermal tempering, which creates residual surface compressive stresses by rapidly cooling the surface of the object while it is hot and in the softened (molten) state.\u00a0This rapid cooling produces a skin of rigid glass surrounding a soft (molten) core. As the molten core solidifies, it tends to shrink, but the outer skin remains rigid. The pull of the solidifying molten core, as it shrinks, creates residual tensile stresses in the core and residual compressive stresses within the outer surface.\nPhilips\u2019 Dental Material, pg- 440, 441",

Although the esthetic result appears much better than that obtained from external bleaching, this approach involves all the inherent risks otherwise associated with endodontic treatment. External bleaching techniques offer a safer alternative, although they may not be as rapid or effective.\u00a0\nPatients who have darkly stained teeth always should be informed that although porcelain (or composite) veneers can result in improved esthetics, they may not entirely eliminate or mask extremely dark stains. Because of the limited thickness of the veneers and the absolute necessity of incorporating intrinsic opacity, the realistic translucency or esthetic vitality of veneered teeth may never be comparable with that of natural, unaffected teeth. Full porcelain coverage with all-ceramic crowns may be indicated in some patients with severe discoloration because of the crown\u2019s greater capacity to restore esthetic vitality.\nReference- Sturdevant 7th ed Pg-281",
