Strabismus, which occurs as a result of visual loss, is the second most common mode of presentation. Thus, funduscopic examination through a well-dilated pupil must be performed in all cases of childhood strabismus. Retinoblastoma can cause secondary changes in the eye, including glaucoma, retinal detachment, and inflammation secondary to tumor necrosis. Pseudouveitis, with a red eye and pain and associated hypopyon and hyphema, is a rare presentation. It is characteristic of an infiltrating type of retinoblastoma in which the tumor cells invade the retina diffusely without forming a discrete tumor mass. Orbital inflammation mimicking orbital cellulitis may occur in eyes with necrotic tumors and does not necessarily imply extraocular extension. Proptosis is a more common presenting symptom in most underdeveloped countries. Histologically, the growth consists chiefly of small round cells with large nuclei resembling the cells of the nuclear layers of the retina. Many of these cells stain poorly, showing that they are undergoing necrosis. Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes like formation of cells resembling the rods and cones may be found.",

However, practically there is always some associated inflammation of the adjacent structures such as retina, vitreous, sclera and cornea. Due to close relationship between the anatomically distinct pa of the uveal tract, the inflammatory process usually involve the uvea as a whole and are generally not limited to a single pa. However, the uveitis is classified according to the pa of uvea which is clinically more affected. For example, the term iritis is used when iris appears to be more affected. Anatomical classification of uveitis 1. Anterior uveitis. It is inflammation of the uveal tissue from iris up to pars plicata of ciliary body. It may be subdivided into - Iritis, in which inflammation predominantly affects the iris. Iridocyctitis in which iris and pars plicata pa of ciliary body are equally involved, and Cyclitis, in which pars plicata pa of ciliary body is predominatly affected. 2. Intermediate uveitis. It includes inflammation of the pars plana and peripheral pa of the retina and underlying `choroid'. It is also called 'pars planitis'. 3. Posterior uveitis. It refers to inflammation of the choroid (choroiditis). Always there is associated inflamation of retina and hence the term `chorioretinitis' is used. 4. Panuveitis.

The posterior displacement of eye is prevented by - orbital fat, forward pull of oblique muscles and bony attachment of recto. Fascia Bulbi (Tenon's capsule) It is thin fibrous membrane that envelops the globe from margin of cornea to the optic nerve. Its inner surface is connected to sclera by fine trabeculae. Probably slight movements may take place b/w the globe and capsule but in more extensive movements the globe & capsule more together in surrounding fat. Anteriorly it merges gradually into subconjunctival tissue Posteriorly it is in contact with orbital fat and around the optic nerve it fuses with dural sheath of optic nerve Lower pa of fascia bulbi (Tenon's capsule) is thickened to form a sling or hammock on which globe rests, which is known as suspensory ligament of Lockwood. That it is effective in suppoing the eye is shown by the fact that the globe does not sink down after maxillectomy (surgical) or fractures of orbital floor, if the suspensory ligament remains intact. Fascia bulbi is pierced by optic nerve & ciliary vessels and nerve (posteriorly) Voex veins (just behind equator) and 6 extinsic ocular muscles (anteriorly) The extraocular muscles do not perforate the capsule but invaginate (pierce) it and fascia send a tubular reflection backwards which clothes muscle like fingers of a glove. This muscle expansion of lateral & medial rectus are attached to orbital tubercles on zygomatic bone and lacrimal bone respectively. These are also called lateral & medial check ligaments. These expansions are strong and to some extent limit the action of the muscles. They are there fore called check ligaments. Muscle expansion of superior rectus is attached to LPS (levator palpebrae superioris) and form superior transverse ligament of whitnall to ensure the synergic action of two muscles. Thus when the superior rectus makes the eye look upwards, the upper lid is raised as well. Expansion from inferior rectus is attached to capsulopalpebral fasciae or whitnall ligament (b/w tarsal plate & orbicularis oculi), a tissue analogue to LPS in the lower lid. Conjoint fascia of inferior rectus & oblique form suspensory ligament of Lockwood. Superior oblique expansion passes unto its trochlea & inferior oblique expansion passes to floor of orbit (lateral pa).",

Initial treatment is with a topical beta-blocker, such as timolol, with the provison that significant systemic absorption may occur; the usual cautions and contraindications to beta-blockers should be observed. If initial treatment does not reduce intraocular pressure sufficiently, additional treatments may include parasympathomimetics (e.g. pilocarpine); selective alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonists (e.g. brimonidine); carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. dorzolamide) and prostaglandin analogues (e.g. latanoprost).

        "exp": "The posterior cerebral aeries supply the coical surfaces of the occipital and medial temporal lobes. Damage to one occipital lobe (e.g., by trauma or by ischemia/infarction due to stroke) usually produces a contralateral homonymous hemianopia. Occlusion of the right posterior cerebral aery would therefore result in a left homonymous hemianopia;blindness in the left half of the visual field in both eyes. In addition, involvement of the medial temporal lobe might give rise to peduncular hallucinosis;visual illusions or elementary (unformed) hallucinations. Bilateral lesions would cause \"coical\" blindness, which does not affect the pupillary reflexes. Bitemporal hemianopia is a loss of vision in the temporal quadrants of the visual field. (It is also termed heteronymous hemianopia). This occurs in lesions of the optic chiasm, which may occur with pituitary tumors. Central scotoma is a loss of vision in the center of the visual field, with preservation of the peripheral fields. It is associated with optic neuritis, a common complication of multiple sclerosis. Superior quadrantanopia is caused by lesions in the upper poion of the contralateral temporal lobe. Ref: Ropper A.H., Samuels M.A. (2009). Chapter 13. Disturbances of Vision. In A.H.

Phacoemulsification It is nothing else but an advancement in the method of doing ECCE. Here the nucleus is conveed into pulp or emulsified using high frequency sound waves, and then sucked out of the eye through a small (3.2 mm) incision. A special foldable IOL is then inseed into the posterior chamber through the same incision. ECCE by phacoemulsification with foldable posterior chamber IOL is the procedure of choice for cataract. The steps in phacoemulsification include :(i) Corneoscleral incision, (ii) Continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis, (iii) Hydrodissection and hydrodelineation (iv) Emulsification and aspiration of nucleus and then coex, and (v) Foldable IOL implantation in posterior chamber. Recovery with phacoemulsification is fastest as incision is very small and no sutures are taken.",

Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis is a delayed hypersensitivity response, in most cases in developed countries to S aureus or other bacteria that proliferate on the lid margin in association with blepharitis. Peak incidence of this disease is between 3- 15 years of age. Incidence is higher in girls, and the disease is common in under nourished children living in unhygienic condition. A phlyctena is a pinkish white elevation commonly appearing at the limbus in the bulbar conjunctiva. Engorged conjunctival vessels cluster around at its base and the surrounding conjunctiva may be mildly hyperemic. Rx: Topical coicosteroid therapy shoens their duration and decreases scarring and vascularization.

The optic disc is placed 3-4 mm nasal to the fovea (fovea is temporal to optic disc). There is a central depression in the optic disc called physiological cup. There are no light sensitive rods or cones to respond to a light stimulus. Therefore, it causes a break in the visual field called the blind spot or physiological blind spot which is presented as physiological absolute scotoma on visual field chaing. Optic disc is the location where ganglionic cells axons exit the eye to form the optic nerve and optic disc represents the beginning of the optic nerve. The optic nerve head (optic disc) in a normal human eye carries 1-1.2 million neurons from the eye towards the brain. The optic disc is also the entry point for the major blood vessels (CRA & CRV) that supply the retina. CRA and CRV emerge through the physiological cup. Macula lutea (yellow spot) Macula lutea is a small yellowish area 5.5 mm in diameter, situated at the posterior pole of the eyeball, temporal to the optic disc. Fovea centralis is the central depressed pa of the macula and has a diameter of 1.5 mm. It is situated about 2 Disc diameter (3 mm) temporal to the temporal margin of optic disc. It is the most sensitive pa of retina, with lowest threshold for light and highest visual acuity because it contains only cones. Following pas are related to fovea centralis :? Foveola :- Forms the central floor of the fovea (0.35 mm in diameter). Actually, it is foveola which is situated 2 Disc diameter (3 mm) temporal to temporal margin of the disc Umbo Is a tiny depression in the very centre of foveola.

Its administration can be directly observed. Therefore, compliance is higher than with tetracycline and can actually be measured, whereas, with the home administration of tetracycline, the level of compliance is unknown. Azithromycin has high efficacy and a low incidence of adverse effects. When adverse effects occur, they are usually mild; gastrointestinal upset and rash are the most common adverse events.

Because accommodation cannot occur, the near point moves way from the eye and images must be held at some distance from the eye to be clearly seen. This is similar to the situation in hyperopia where the converging power is too weak for the axial length of the eye. Hyperopes must accommodate to see distant objects clearly and thus have less accommodation available for near vision. Thus hyperopes, like presbyopes, must hold objects at a distance to see them clearly (hence the term \"farsighted\"). Ref: Riordan-Eva P. (2011). Chapter 21. Optics & Refraction. In P.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a DNA virus in the family Herpesviridae known for producing large cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions called an \"owl's eye\" effect. While CMV is found in almost everyone, and is usually fought off by the immune system, for people who are immunocompromised, by diseases, transplants, or chemotherapy the virus is not adequately destroyed and can cause damage to the eye and the rest of the body. HIV positive persons are most at risk, especially when the CD4 cell count decreases. It is usually treated by antivirals such as ganciclovir or foscarnet, which can be taken orally, intravenously, injected directly into the eye (intravitreal injection). Ganciclovir has good antiviral propey against herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Epstein-Barr virus, and is at least 100 times more potent an inhibitor of CMV replication in vitro than acyclovir. Fomivirsen is the first antisense drug as an intraocular injection for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis.",

Infectious conjunctivitis (pinkeye) accounts for 70 percent of all cases and is caused by either a bacteria (usually staphylococci, pneumococci, streptococci or chlamydia trachomatis) or a virus. Bacterial conjunctivitis occurs in 50 percent of all cases, and viral conjunctivitis occurs in 20 percent. Infectious conjunctivitis is very contagious. Noninfectious conjunctivitis (which accounts for the remaining 30 percent of all cases), can be caused by allergies (such as pollen or grass), chemicals (such as air pollutants, smoke or household cleaners), or underlying diseases (such as rheumatoid ahritis, lupus, Kawasaki's disease, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease). Additionally, conjunctivitis can be caused by hemorrhaging from trauma or changes in pressure within the head (subconjunctival hemorrhage).

A varix can be identified by using Valsalva maneuver, ultrasonography, CT scanning or MRI. Treatment of this condition is usually not necessary.

Theuse of cycloplegics is useful in refraction and there are ceain situations where they are indicated. Because of their strong accommodative reserve, very young people (< 16 years) should always be refracted after the use of cyclopleagics : - < 5 years of age : - Atropine 1% ointment is the drug of choice. 15 - 20 years : - Homatropine (2% drop), cyclopentolate (1% drop) or tropicamide (5%, 10% drop) are used. Atropine must be used if the patient has a convergent squint or has high hypermetropia. There is no need for cycloplegia as a routine in adults (20-40 years). However cycloplegics are indicated in following situations : - Accommodation is abnormally active (e.g., spasm of accommodation). Objective findings by retinoscopy do not agree with the patient's subjective requirement. Symptoms of accommodative asthenopia are present. If the pupil is small. If the patient is above 40 years, cycloplegia is rarely necessary. Only mydriatic (10% phenylephrine) may be needed when the pupil is narrow or media is slightly hazy.",

        "question": "Accomodation is maximum in which of the following: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Children As the lens gets older, the central cells become sclerosed and more compressed, thus forming a relatively hard nucleus. Consequently, the lens tends to respond less to changes in tension of the capsule (during accommodation) Thus, a normal child of 10 years is able to see a small object clearly when it is only 7 cm from the eye, while a person of 30 years of age may not see clearly at a distance less than 14 cm Accommodation It is the process by which the eye changes optical power to maintain a clear image (focus) on an object as its distance changes. Accommodation acts like a reflex, but can also be consciously controlled. Mammals, birds and reptiles vary the optical power by changing the form of the elastic lens using the ciliary body (in humans up to 15 diopters). The young human eye can change focus from distance to 7 cm from the eye in 350 milliseconds. This dramatic change in focal power of the eye of approximately 12 diopters (a diopter is 1 divided by the focal length in meters) occurs as a consequence of a reduction in zonular tension induced by ciliary muscle contraction. The amplitude of accommodation declines with age. By the fifth decade of life the accommodative amplitude has declined so the near point of the eye is more remote than the reading distance. When this occurs the patient is presbyopic. Once presbyopia occurs, those who are emmetropic (do not require optical correction for distance vision) will need an optical aid for near vision; those who are myopic (nearsighted and require an optical correction for distance vision), will find that they see better at near without their distance correction; and those who are hyperopic (farsighted) will find that they may need a correction for both distance and near vision. Accommodation decreases to essentially 0 dioptres at the age of 70 years. It is normally accompanied by a convergence of the eyes to keep them directed at the same point, sometimes termed accommodation convergence reflex Induced effects of accommodation When someone accommodates to a near object, they also converge their eyes and constrict their pupils. The combination of these three movements (accommodation, convergence and miosis) is under the control of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and is referred to as the near triad.",

        "exp": "Ans. C: 50-60% Retinopathy of prematurity/ ROP/retrolental fibroplasia /RLF is a disease of the eye that affects prematurely born babies. As such, all preterm babies are at risk for ROP, and very low bih weight is an additional risk factor. Normally, maturation of the retina proceeds in-utero and at term, the mature infant has fully vascularised retina. However, in preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. ROP occurs when the development of the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. The key disease element is fibrovascular proliferation. This is growth of abnormal new vessels that may regress, but frequently progresses. Patients with ROP are at greater risk for strabismus, glaucoma, cataracts and myopia later in life. Retinal vascularization is judged to be complete when vessels extend to the ora serrata. Retinal examination with scleral depression is generally recommended for patients born before 30-32 weeks gestation, with bihweight 1500 grams or less, or at the discretion of the treating neonatologist. The initial examination is usually performed at 4-6 weeks of life, and then repeated every 1-3 weeks until vascularization is complete (or until disease progression mandates treatment). The most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis may arise from the similarity of two other diseases: Familal Exudative Vitreoretinopathy which is a genetic disorder that also disrupts the retinal vascularization in full-term infants. Persistent Fetal Vascular Syndrome also known as Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous that can cause a traction retinal detachment difficult to differentiate but typically unilateral. Prophylaxis is most impoant. In the management of premature infants, the Pa02 level from the umbilical aery should be monitored, levels of 50-100 mm Hg being regarded as unlikely to produce constriction of immature retinal vessels. Unsatisfactory guides includes 'pinkiness', oxygen given at less than 40% in the tent and vascular constriction as seen by ophthalmologist. In establishes cases: Peripheral retinal ablation is the mainstay of ROP treatment. The destruction of the avascular retina is performed with a solid state laser photocoagulation device Cryotherapy, a technique in which regional retinal destruction was done using a probe to freeze the desired areas, However, cryotherapy is no longer preferred for routine avascular retinal ablation in premature babies, due to the side effects of inflammation and lid swelling. Scleral buckling and/or vitrectomy surgery may be considered for severe ROP Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab has been repoed as a suppoive measure in aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Caroticocavernous fistula Proptosis (exophthalmos) Proptosis is bulging of the eyeball (forward bulging) beyond the orbital margins. Though the word exophthalmos is synonymous with proptosis; some source define exophthalmos as a protrusion of globe greater than 18mm and proptosis as a protrusion equal to or less than 18 mm. Proptosis may be classified as follows : ? 1) Unilateral Proptosis Proptosis of one eye. Inflammatory lesions :- Orbital cellulitis, abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, etc. Vascular disturbances :- Haemorrhage, varicose orbital veins, haemangioma, etc. Cysts and tumour :- Dermoid cyst, osteoma, lymphoma, lymphosarcoma, glioma, meningioma of optic nerve, retinoblastoma and metastatic deposits in orbit . Systemic diseases - Leukemias and endocrine disturbances such as Graves' disease and thyrotropic exophthalmos in initial stages. Paralysis of extraocular muscles as in complete ophthalmoplegia. Mucocele of PNS' - Frontal (most common), ethmoid, maxillary. The most common cause of unilateral proptosis in children is orbital cellulitis. The most common cause of unilateral proptosis in adults is thyroid ophthalmopathy. 2) Bilateral Proptosis Proptosis of both eyes. Developmental anomalies of the skull- Oxycephaly (tower skull). Endocrine exophthalmos, both thyrotoxic and thyrotropic. Inflammatory lesions - Cavernous sinus thrombosis. Tumours - lymphosarcoma, lymphoma, pseudotumour, nephroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma. Systemic disease - Histocytosis (Hand - schuller christon disease), amyloidosis, wegner's granulomatosis. Most common cause of bilateral proptosis in children Neuroblastoma (mc), Leukemia (Chloroma) Most common cause of bilateral proptosis in adults is thyroid ophthalmopathy. 3) Intermittent proptosis Proptosis developing intermittently and rapidly in one eye when venous stasis is induced by forward bending or lowering the head, turning the head forcibly, hyperextension of the neek, coughing, forced expiration with or without compression of the nostrils, or pressure on jugular veins. The most impoant casue is orbital varix (varicocele). 4) Pulsatile proptosis :- Pulsatile proptosis is seen in caroticocovernous fistula; saccular aneurysm of ophthalmic aery; and due to transmitted cerebral pulsation as seen in meningocele, neurofibromatosis and traumatic or operative hiatus.",

A: Iris and Ciliary Body Anterior uveitis include iritis, anterior cyclitis and iridocyclitis Anatomical classification of uveitis Uveitis may be classified anatomically into anterior, intermediate, posterior and panuveitic forms, based on which pa of the eye is primarily affected by the inflammation. \"Anterior uveitis\" (or iridocyclitis) is the inflammation of the iris and anterior chamber. Anywhere from two-thirds to 90% of uveitis cases are anterior in location. Symptoms include red eye, injected conjunctiva, pain and decreased vision. Signs include dilated ciliary vessels, presence of cells and flare in the anterior chamber, and keratic precipitates (\"KP\") on the posterior surface of the cornea. \"Intermediate uveitis\" (pars planitis) consists of vitritis - inflammatory cells in the vitreous cavity, sometimes with snowbanking, or deposition of inflammatory material on the pars plana. \"Posterior uveitis\" (or chorioretinitis) is the inflammation of the retina and choroid. \"Pan-uveitis\" is the inflammation of all the layers of the uvea. Systemic disorders associated with uveitis Ankylosing spondylitis Behcet's disease Chronic granulomatous disease Enthesitis Inflammatory bowel disease Juvenile rheumatoid ahritis Kawasaki's disease Multiple sclerosis Polyaeritis nodosa Psoriatic ahritis Reactive ahritis Sarcoidosis Systemic lupus erythematosus Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome Whipple's disease Lyme disease Infectious causes Uveitis may be a (normal) immune response to fight an infection inside the eye. While representing the minority of patients with uveitis, such possible infections include: Brucellosis Herpes simplex Herpes zoster Leptospirosis Lyme disease Toxocariasis Toxoplasmosis Uveitis Syndromes Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) Birdshot retinochoroidopathy Fuchs Heterochromic Iridocyclitis Multifocal Choroiditis and Panuveitis Syndrome Masquerade syndromes Masquerade syndromes are ophthalmic disorders that clinically present as either an anterior or posterior uveitis, but are not primarily inflammatory. The following are some of the most common: Anterior segment - Intraocular foreign body - Juvenile xanthogranuloma - Leukemia - Retinal detachment - Retinoblastoma Posterior segment - Lymphoma - Multiple sclerosis - Retinitis pigmentosa - Retinoblastoma Symptoms Redness of the eye Blurred vision Sensitivity to light (photophobia) Dark, floating spots along the visual field Eye pain Treatment Uveitis is typically treated with glucocoicoid steroids, either as topical eye drops (prednisolone acetate) or oral therapy with coicosteroids. But before administration of coicosteroids, corneal ulcers are ruled out, typically by a Florescence Dye test. In addition to coicosteroids, topical cycloplegics, such as atropine or homatropine, may be used. In some cases an injection of PSTTA (posterior subtenon triamcinolone acetate) may also be given to reduce the swelling of the eye. Antimetabolite medications, such as methotrexate are often used for recalcitrant or more aggressive cases of uveitis.",

Owing to the occurrence of a wide range of complications associated with RBA, anesthesiologists and ophthalmologists began to turn to peribulbar anesthesia (PBA), which consists of introducing a needle into the extraconal space, as a theoretically safer form of regional ocular anesthesia. Peribulbar anesthesia (PBA) was formally described in 1986 and is based on the \"tissue compament principle.\" The latter refers to the phenomenon wherein a needle is inseed into a compament and the local anesthetic injected spreads by viue of its pressure and volume throughout the compament. With PBA a relatively large volume (8-12 ml) of local anesthetic is injected into the extraconal space; to provide adequate analgesia and akinesis of the globe, the extraconal local anesthetic must spread to the intraconal space",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Binocular diplopia Strabismus is an abnormal ocular condition in which the visual axes of the eyes are not directed at the same point. There are two kinds of strabismus, paralytic and nonparalytic. Paralytic strabismus results from the inability of the ocular muscles to move the eye because of neurologic deficit or muscular dysfunction. The muscle that is dysfunctional may be identified by watching as the patient attempts to move the eyes to each of the cardinal positions of gaze. If the affected eye cannot be directed to a position, the examiner infers that the associated ocular muscle is the dysfunctional one. Because this kind of strabismus may be caused by tumor, infection, or injury to the brain or the eye, an ophthalmologic examination is recommended. The chief complaint of patients with paralysis of an extrinsic muscle is usually that they see double. If both the eyes are functional and one detes, binocular diplopia results. Nonparalytic strabismus is a defect in the position of the two eyes in relation to each other. The condition may be inherited. The person cannot use the two eyes together but has to fixate with one or the other. The eye that looks straight at a given time is the fixing eye. Some people have alternating strabismus, using one eye and then the other; some have monocular strabismus, which affects only one eye. Visual acuity diminishes with diminished use of an eye, and suppression amblyopia may develop. Nonparalytic strabismus and suppression amblyopia are treated most successfully in early childhood. The primary treatment to prevent amblyopia consists mainly of covering the fixing eye, forcing the child to use the deting eye. The earlier it is begun, the more rapid and effective is the treatment. The eyes might be straightened by surgery, but suppression amblyopia will not be corrected.",

FA in central serous chorioretinopathy gives smoke stack and ink blot appearance. Cystoid Macular Edema (CME) Definition and Etiology - CME is a final common pathological response of retina to a variety of insults, consisting of fluid accumulation in outer plexiform (Henle's) layer and inner nuclear layer of the central macula that results in the formation of visible cystic space. - Initially fluid accumulates intracellularly in Muller cells, with subsequent rupture forming microcystic spaces. These coalesce into larger cavities and may progress to lamellar hole formation at the fovea with irreversible impairment of central vision. - CME is commonly a/w intraocular inflammations (eg pars planitis), vascular incompetence (diabetes & RVO), vitreoretinal traction, inherited diseases (eg RP or dominant CME), medications (epinephrine, latanoprost) and most commonly following cataract surgeryQ (k/a Irvine-Gass syndrome). Agiographically evident CME is seen in 60% ECCE, 20% ICCE and 10-20% phacoemulsification cases (all uncomplicated). Clinically significant CME with decreased visual acuity, however, is seen only in 0.2-3% patients. - Planned posterior capsulorrhexis during phacoemulsification does not 1/t an increase prevalence of CME, whereas those with inadveent rupture of posterior capsule &/or persistent vitreous traction to anterior segment are at highest risk.

C: Nd-YAG 'After' cataracts, if thin, can be cleared centrally by a YAG laser capsulotomy Nd:YAG/ Neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet/ Nd:Y3A15O12 It is a crystal that is used as a lasing medium for solid-state lasers. The dopant, triply ionized neodymium, typically replaces yttrium in the crystal structure of the yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG), since they are of similar size. Generally the crystalline host is doped with around 1% neodymium by atomic percent. Nd:YAG lasers are optically pumped using a flashtube or laser diodes. Nd:YAG lasers typically emit light with a wavelength of 1064 nm, in the infrared. However, there are also transitions near 940,1120,1320, and 1440 nm. Nd:YAG lasers operate in both pulsed and continuous mode. Pulsed Nd:YAG lasers are typically operated in the so called Q-switching mode: Nd:YAG absorbs mostly in the bands between 730-760 nm and 790-820 nm. At low current densities krypton flashlamps have higher output in those bands than do the more common xenon lamps, which produce more light at around 900 nm. The former are therefore more efficient for pumping Nd:YAG lasers Uses Nd:YAG lasers are used in ophthalmology to correct posterior capsular opacification, a condition that may occur after cataract surgery, and for peripheral iridotomy in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma, where it has superseded surgical iridectomy. Frequency-doubled Nd:YAG lasers (wavelength 532 nm) are used for pan-retinal photocoagulation in patients with diabetic retinopathy. In oncology, Nd:YAG lasers can be used to remove skin cancers. These lasers are also used extensively in the field of cosmetic medicine for laser hair removal and the treatment of minor vascular defects such as spider veins on the face and legs. Using hysteroscopy the Nd:YAG laser has been used for removal of uterine septa within the inside of the uterus. In podiatry, the Nd:YAG laser is being used to treat onychomycosis, which is fungus infection of the toenail.",

        "question": "All of the following are true for retinoblastoma except: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Always unilateral The fellow eye in retinoblastoma, is affected, independently, not by metastasis, in about one-fouh of the cases Retinoblastoma/ Rb It is a rapidly developing cancer that develops in the cells of retina In the developed world, Rb has one of the best cure rates of all childhood cancers (95-98%), with more than nine out of every ten sufferers surviving into adulthood Classification There are two forms of the disease; a heritable form and non-heritable form (all cancers are considered genetic in that mutations of the genome are required for their development, but this does not imply that they are heritable, or transmitted to offspring). Approximately 55% of children with Rb have the non-heritable form. If there is no history of the disease within the family, the disease is labeled \"sporadic\", but this does not necessarily indicate that it is the non-heritable form. In about two thirds of cases, only one eye is affected (unilateral retinoblastoma); in the other third, tumours develop in both eyes (bilateral retinoblastoma). The number and size of tumours on each eye may vary. In ceain cases, the pineal gland is also affected (trilateral retinoblastoma). Signs and symptoms The most common and obvious sign of retinoblastoma is an abnormal appearance of the pupil, leukocoria, also known as amaurotic cat's eye reflex. Some children with retinoblastoma can develop a squint, commonly referred to as \"cross-eyed\" or \"wall-eyed\" (strabismus). Retinoblastoma presents with advanced disease in developing countries and eye enlargement is a common finding. A white eye reflection is not always a positive indication of retinoblastoma and can be caused by light being reflected badly or by other conditions such as Coats's Disease. Frequency of retinoblastoma Most children are diagnosed before the age of five years old.In developed countries, bilateral cases usually present within the first year with the average age at diagnosis being 9 months. Diagnosis of unilateral cases peaks between 24 and 30 months. Cause of retinoblastoma In children with the heritable genetic form of retinoblastoma there is a mutation on chromosome 13, called the RB1 gene. The defective RB1 gene can be inherited from either parent; in some children, however, the mutation occurs in the early stages of fetal development. Inherited forms of retinoblastomas are more likely to be bilateral; in addition, they may be associated with pinealoblastoma (also known as trilateral retinoblastoma) with a dismal outcome. Differential diagnosis Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV): congenital developmental anomaly of the eye resulting from failure of the embryological, primary vitreous and hyaloid vasculature to regress, whereby the eye is shoer, develops a cataract, and may present with whitening of the pupil. Coat's disease: a typically unilateral disease characterised by abnormal development of blood vessels behind the retina, leading to blood vessel abnormalities in the retina and retinal detachment to mimic retinoblastoma. Toxocara canis: an infectious disease of the eye associated with exposure to infected puppies, which causes a retinal lesion leading to retinal detachment. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP): associated with low bih weight infants who receive supplemental oxygen in the period immediately after bih, it involves damage to the retinal tissue and may lead to retinal detachment. Morphology Gross and microscopic appearances of retinoblastoma are identical in both hereditary and sporadic types. Macroscopically, ble tumor cells are found near blood vessels, while zones of necrosis are found in relatively avascular areas. Microscopically, both undifferentiated and differentiated elements may be present. Undifferentiated elements appear as collections of small, round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei; differentiated elements include Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, Homer-Wright rosettes, and fluerettes from photoreceptor differentiation Treatment The first priority is to preserve the life of the child, then to preserve the vision and thirdly to minimize any complications or side effects of the treatment. Many treatment options exist, including chemotherapy, cryotherapy, radioactive plaques, laser therapy, external beam radiotherapy and surgical removal of the eyeball. Any combinations of these treatments may be adopted.",

Patients have problem in dimly lit theaters, restaurants and when they come indoors from bright sun light - Visual field constriction i.e. slowly progressive loss of peripheral vision or concentric contraction of visual field results in characteristic tubular (tunnel) vision. It occurs in midstage of disease and there is poor correlation between acuity and extent of tunnel vision. Patient may appear clumsy & colloid with objects b/ o unrecognized tunnel vision. - Ultimately central vision is also lost by 50-60 years of age. Later manifestations (complications) include posterior sub capsular cataract (in middle age), cystoids macular edema. Both reduce central acuity even when the RP affects the peripheral retina only. Choroidal bodies (sclerosis), progressive chorioretinal atrophy and epiretinal membrane may be other latge complications Fundus Examination - Classical key features include atrophy and thinning of RPE, narrowing (attenuation) of retinal aerioles and bone spicule intraretinal pigmentary changes (typically perivascular and resembling bone corpuscles). These changes are initially found in mid peripheral (equatorial) regions f/b far peripheral retina with relative preservation of macula. - There is gradual increase in density with anterior and posterior spread, resulting in tessellated fundus appearance (d/t RPE atrophy) and unmasking of choroidal vessels. - Gliotic waxy nerve pallor of optic disc (waxy pale optic disc) from reactive gliosis, macular atrophy, epiretinal membrane & CMG are late features. Perimetry - Small mid peripheral scoloma (earliest) that gradually coalesce to form the classical annular or ring scotoma (complete or paial), which expands both peripherally & centrally. It leaves tiny central island of vision which may eventually be lost. - Useful in monitoring progression of disease Dark Adaptometry - Prolonged dark adaptation is useful for diagnosing early unceain cases ERG - In early RP, scotopic rod and combined response is reduced (i.e. ERG is subnormal) Gradually photopic response becomes reduced and eventually ERG is extinguished EOG - Markedly subnormal with absence of light rise (peak) - Retinitis pigmentosa sine pigmento is characterized by all clinical features except there is no visible pigmentary changes in the fundus - Retinitis punctata albescens is characterized by multiple scattered white dots mostly between posterior pole & equator. Other findings are same to R.P. Sectorial R.P. Involvement of only one quadrant (usually nasal) of the fundus - Pericentric R.P.

Elicitation: To check for pupillary reflex, lights should be switched off in the examination room. A flashlight is shown in one eye at a time and both the direct and consensual reflexes (i.e., reflex in other pupil) are observed. The light is then switched on, and after a few minutes pass for the patient to adjust to the ambient light, the patient is asked to look straight at a distant object. Either the examiner's finger or the tip of a pen is placed about 4 to 6 inches in front of the eyes at the level of the bridge of the nose and patient is asked to switch gaze from the distant object to the object in front of the patient. Pupillary response to this near focus is noted. Normal response: Pupils are regular and constrict promptly and equally to accommodation and to direct and indirect light.

The cornea (especially anterior surface) is the most impoant refractive surface of eye. The refractive power of cornea depend on two factors (i) Refractive index of cornea (Directly related), (ii) Radius of curvature (inversly related). Second impoant refractive structure of eye is lens with refractive index 1.386 - 1.406. Center (nucleus) of lens has maximum refractive index (1.46) amongst all the refractive structures of eye. Third impoant factor determining the refractive power of eye is the axial length of eyeball. lmm change in axial length leads to change of 3D in refractive power. For example, 1 mm shoening in axial length causes hypermetropia of 3D and 1mm lengthening causes myopia of 3D.

Hyperopia Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment A rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) occurs when a tear in the retina leads to fluid accumulation with a separation of the neurosensory retina from the underlying RPE MC type of retinal detachment Pathophysiology: Vitreoretinal traction is responsible for the occurrence of most RRD. As the vitreous becomes more syneretic (liquefied) with age, a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) occurs. In most eyes, the vitreous gel separates from the retina without any sequelae. However, in ceain eyes, strong vitreoretinal adhesions are present and the occurrence of a PVD can lead to a retinal tear formation; then, fluid from the liquefied vitreous can seep under the tear, leading to a retinal detachment Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment Predisposing Factors: Myopia Aphakia or pseudophakia Vitroretinal degeneration Lattice degeneration Snail track degeneration Diffuse chorioretinal atrophy Macular holes Posterior vitreous degeneration Trauma Vitreous loss during cataract surgery",

        "exp": "Ans. C: Lagophthalmos Lagophthalmos is a condition in which there is incomplete closure of the palpebral apeure when an attempt is made to shut the eyes Lagophthalmos It is defined as the inability to close the eyelids completely. Blinking covers the eye with a thin layer of tear fluid, thereby promoting a moist environment necessary for the cells of the exterior pa of the eye. The tears also flush out foreign bodies and wash them away. This is crucial to maintain lubrication and proper eye health. If this process is impaired, as in lagophthalmos, the eye can suffer abrasions and infections. Lagopthalmos leads to corneal drying and ulceration Pathophysiology Lagophthalmos can arise from a malfunction of the Facial nerve. Lagopthalmos can also occur in comatose patients having a decrease in orbicularis tone, in patients having palsy of the facial nerve (7th cranial nerve), and in people with severe skin disorders such as ichthyosis. Today, lagophthalmos may arise after an overenthusiastic upper blepharoplasty. Blepharoplasty is an operation performed to remove excessive skin overlying the upper eyelid (suprapalpebral hooding) that often occurs with aging. This can appreciably improve the patient's appearance, and make the patient look younger. If, however, excessive skin is removed, the appearance is unnatural and \"lagophthalmos\" is one of the signs of such excessive skin removal.",

Within the anterior segment are two fluid-filled spaces: The anterior chamber between the posterior surface of the cornea (i.e. the corneal endothelium) and the iris. The depth of anterior chamber of eye is 2.5 mm. It is shallow in the very young and the deep. The posterior chamber between the iris and the front face of the vitreous. Aqueous humor fills these spaces within the anterior segment and provides nutrients to the surrounding structures. The posterior segment is the back five-sixths of the eye that includes the anterior hyaloid membrane and all of the optical structures behind it: the vitreous humor, retina, choroid, and optic nerve. The radii of the anterior and posterior sections are 8 mm and 12 mm, respectively. The point of junction is called the limbus. On the other side of the lens is the second humour, the aqueous humour, which is bounded on all sides: by the lens, ciliary body, suspensory ligaments and by the retina.

For example, when the head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left, and vice versa. Since slight head movement is present all the time, the VOR is very impoant for stabilizing vision: patients whose VOR is impaired find it difficult to read using print, because they cannot stabilize the eyes during small head tremors. The VOR does not depend on visual input and works even in total darkness or when the eyes are closed. However, in the presence of light, the fixation reflex is also added to the movement.",

However, RAID is most characteristically associated with optic nerve.\nThis thing I will have to explain in detail.\nTwo types of lesion can occur in afferent pupillary pathway :-\n\ni)\u00a0Total (complete) afferent papillary defect :- This will result in amaurotic light reflex (amaurotic pupil) i.e. absence of ipsilateral direct and contralateral consensual light reflex. However, it should be kept in mind that complete amaurotic pupil will occur in lesion of retina and optic nerve. In lesion of optic tract there will be Wernicke's hemianopic pupil because fibres from nasal half of retina deccusate at optic chiasma and go to contralateral side. In other words (according to me), hemianopic pupil is nothing else but amaurotic light reflex but the only difference is that the light reflex is absent when light is shone to temporal half of ipsilateral retina and on nasal half of contralateral retina. While in true amaurotic light reflex light reflex is absent when light is shone to the ipsilateral retina whether temporal half or nasal half.\nii) Relative (incomplete) afferent pupillary defect :- In relative afferent pupillary defect there is Marcus Gunn pupil.\nHowever (as in above discussion) classic Marcus Gunn pupil (RAPD) occurs if there is incomplete lesion of either in retina or in optic nerve. In incomplete lesion of optic tract Marcus Gunn pupil like reaction will occur when the light is shone to temporal half of ipsilateral retina and nasal half of contralateral retina.

Loss of integrity of the globe as a result of penetration may produce a shallow or flat anterior chamber. This, in association with attendant inflammation, can result in secondary angle-closure glaucoma with extensive peripheral anterior synechiae. Frank disruption of the lens capsule may produce lens paicle glaucoma. Cataract formation may produce phacomorphic glaucoma or phacolytic glaucoma if the cataract becomes hypermature. Siderotic glaucoma may occur as a late manifestation of a retained iron-containing foreign body. Diagnosis: Dilated fundus exam may allow easy visualization of the retained foreign body. Occasionally, a foreign body is located in the anterior chamber and is found on gonioscopy. If the media are not clear enough to allow fundoscopic examination, additional studies including plain films, computed tomography, and ultrasonography are helpful in confirming the diagnosis.
