        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., CRAO Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAP)o The circulation to the retina enters the eye through the central retinal artery. Therefore, its blockade causes severe ischemia to retina. Patient notices sudden painless loss of vision, within a few minutes the eye may become totally blind. Patients's with a patent cilioretinal artery may retain central vision as the macula is sparedo Of all retinal artery occlusions 60% involve central retinal artery, 35% involve branch retinal artery and 5% involve cilioretinal artery. Emboli are the most common cause of retinal artery occlusion. Source of emboli may be i) atheroma in carotid artery; or ii) Mural thrombi secondary to MI or AF; or iii) Mitral valve prolase. Other causes are giant cell arteritis, SLE, wegener's granulomatosis, scleroderma, and occasionally raised IOP.o Complete obstruction of the central retinal artery presents a characteristic ophthalmological picture a few hours after the attack. The larger retinal arteries are constricted and look like thin threads while the smaller vessels are scarcely visible. The fundus appears milky white because of retinal edema. There is cherry-red spot at the macula. Hemorrhages are not seen in CRAO unless the vein is also occluded. Blood column within the retinal veins is segmented (Cattle-tracking). After a few weeks, the retinal swelling subsides and the retina regains its transparency but the disc becomes pale because of atrophy. The retinal arterioles remain narrow.",

For example, the risk of retinopathy is roughly same for two 25 years old patients, of whom one developed DM at 12 years (onset of puberty) and other at the age of 6 years because both have same duration (13 yrs) of disease after the onset of puberty. The risk of retinopathy in children diagnosed prior to the age of 2 years have a negligible risk of retinopathy for the first 10 years. So, age of onset also acts as a risk factor.

As the vitreous shrinks, it becomes somewhat stringy, and the strands can cast tiny shadows on the retina.In most cases, floaters are part of the natural aging process and simply an annoyance. Over time, they tend to settle to the bottom of the eye, becoming less bothersomeFloaters are more likely to develop as we age and are more common in people who are very nearsighted, have diabetes, or who have had previous eye surgeryQ.There are other, more serious causes of floaters, including infection, inflammation (uveitis), hemorrhaging, retinal tears, and injury to the eye.People with diabetes tend to have more floaters because high blood glucose alters the chemical composition of the vitreous, causing it to shrink more rapidly. Also, people with diabetes are more likely to have bleeding inside the eyes as a result of diabetic retinopathy, and patients will sometimes visualize individual red blood cells floating around within their vitreous (sort of looks like hundreds of discrete, little peppercorns.)Patients with severe diabetic retinopathy (proliferative diabetic retinopathy) are especially at risk for a retinal detachment, as abnormal blood %ressels growing into the vitreous are more firmly attached to the retina, pulling it away as the vitreous shrinks (like wall paper being pulled off a wall). If left untreated, a retinal detachment can lead to permanent visual impairment or blindness within a few' days or even hours.Sometimes, a section of the vitreous pulls away (detaches) from the retina all at once, rather than gradually, causing many new floaters to appear suddenly. This is called a vitreous detachment, w'hich in most cases is not sight- threatening and requires only close observation, not treatment.However, a sudden increase in floaters, possibly accompanied by light flashes or peripheral (side) vision loss, could indicate a retinal detachmentFig.: illustration of a floater within the vireousposterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is a condition of the eye in which the vitreous humour separates from the retina",
