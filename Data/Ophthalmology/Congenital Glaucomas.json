(b) Buphthalmos.* Infantile glaucoma, which often produces the clinical sign of Buphthalmos, can be caused when an abnormally narrow angle between the cornea and iris blocks the outflow of aqueous humor; this causes increased intraocular pressure and eventual enlargement of the globe (eyeball).* The predominant signs are prominent eyeball, Haab's striae in Descemet's membrane of cornea, enlarged cornea, myopia.",
