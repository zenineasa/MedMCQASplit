The common presentingsymptoms are sudden appearance of floaters (black spots) in front of the eye or painless loss of visiondue to vitreous haemorrhage. The haemorrhage clears up but recurrences are very common. Clinical course of the Eales' disease can be described in four stages: 1. Stage of inflammation . The affected peripheral veins are congested and perivascular exudates and sheathing are seen along their surface. Superficial haemorrhages ranging from flame-shaped to sheets of haemorrhages may be present near the affected veins. 2. Stage of ischaemia is characterized by obliteration of the involved vessels and development of avascular areas in the periphery as evidenced on fundus fluorescein angiography. 3. Stage of retinal neovascularization is marked by development of abnormal fragile vessels at the junction of perfused and non-perfused retina. Bleeding from these vessels leads to recurrent vitreous haemorrhage. 4.

This disorder affects the retina, specifically cells in a small area near the center of the retina called the macula Vitelliform macular dystrophy causes a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) to build up in cells underlying the macula. The retinal pigment epithelium also degenerates. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of this substance can damage the cells that are critical for clear central vision. As a result, people with this disorder often lose their central vision and may experience blurry or distoed vision, and loss is rarely symmetric. Scotomata appear, first with red light and then for green; finally, relative (or in more serious cases, absolute) scotomata occur with white light. Vitelliform macular dystrophy does not affect side (peripheral) vision or the ability to see at night. Researchers have described two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy with similar features. The early-onset form (known as Best disease) usually appears in childhood; however, the onset of symptoms and the severity of vision loss vary widely. The adult-onset form begins later, usually in middle age, and tends to cause relatively mild vision loss.

Clinical features (A) Visual symptoms 1. Night blindness. It is the characteristic feature and may present several years before the visible changes in the retina appear. It occurs due to degeneration of the rods. 2. Dark adaptation. Light threshold of the peripheral retina is increased; though the process of dark adaptation itself is not affected until very late. 3. Tubular vision occurs in advanced cases. 1. Retinal pigmentary changes. These are typicallyperivascular and resemble bone corpuscles in shape. Initially, these changes are found in the equatorial region only and later spread both anteriorly and posteriorly. 2. Retinal aerioles are attenuated (narrowed) and may become thread-like in late stages. 3. Optic disc becomes pale and waxy in later stages and ultimately consecutive optic atrophy occurs 4. Other associated changes which may be seen are colloid bodies, choroidal sclerosis, cystoid macular oedema, atrophic or cellophane maculopathy. (C) Visual field changes Annular or ring-shaped scotoma is a typical featurewhich corresponds to the degenerated equatorial zone of retina.

These changes may be associated with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The diabetic macular edema occurs due to increased permeability of the retinal capillaries. It is termed as clinically significant macular edema (CSME) if one of the following three criteria are present on slit-lamp examination with 90D lens: \u0001 Thickening of the retina at or within 500 micron of the centre of the fovea. \u0001 Hard exudate at or within 500 micron of the centre of fovea associated with adjacent retinal thickening. \u0001 Development of a zone of retinal thickening one disc diameter or larger in size, at least a pa of which is within one disc diameter of the foveal centre. Clinico-angiographically diabetic maculopathy can be classified into four types: 1. Focal exudative maculopathy . It is characterised by microaneurysms, haemorrhages,macular oedema and hard exudates which are usually arranged in a circinate pattern. Fluorescein angiography reveals focal leakage with adequate macular perfusion. 2. Diffuse exudative maculopathy. It is characterised by diffuse retinal oedema and thickening throughout the posterior pole, with relatively few hard exudates. Fluorescein angiography reveals diffuse leakage at the posterior pole. 3. Ischaemic maculopathy. It occurs due to microvascular blockage. Clinically it is characterised by marked visual loss with microaneurysms,haemorrhages, mild or no macular oedema and a few hard exudates. Fluorescein angiography shows areas of non-perfusion which in early cases are in the form of enlargement of foveal avascular zone (FAZ), later on areas of capillary dropouts are seen and in advanced cases precapillary aerioles are blocked. 4.

Type of optic atrophy seen in this condition is consecutive optic atrophy. causes: The initial retinal degenerative symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa are characterized by decreased night vision (nyctalopia) and the loss of the mid-peripheral visual field. The rod photoreceptor cells, which are responsible for low-light vision and are orientated in the retinal periphery, are the retinal processes affected first during non-syndromic forms of this disease.Visual decline progresses relatively quickly to the far peripheral field, eventually extending into the central visual field as tunnel vision increases. Visual acuity and color vision can become compromised due to accompanying abnormalities in the cone photoreceptor cells, which are responsible for color vision, visual acuity, and sight in the central visual field.The progression of disease symptoms occurs in a symmetrical manner, with both the left and right eyes experiencing symptoms at a similar rate. A variety of indirect symptoms characterize retinitis pigmentosa along with the direct effects of the initial rod photoreceptor degeneration and later cone photoreceptor decline. Phenomena such as photophobia, which describes the event in which light is perceived as an intense glare, and photopsia, the presence of blinking, swirling or shimmering lights within the visual field, often manifest during the later stages of RP. Findings related to RP have often been characterized in the fundus of the eye as the \"ophthalamic triad\".

A paicular blind spot known as the physiological blind spot, \"blind point\", or punctum caecum in medical literature, is the place in the visual field that corresponds to the lack of light-detecting photoreceptor cells on the optic disc of the retina where the optic nerve passes through the optic disc. Because there are no cells to detect light on the optic disc, the corresponding pa of the field of vision is invisible. Some process in our brains interpolates the blind spot based on surrounding detail and information from the other eye, so we do not normally perceive the blind spot. Although all veebrates have this blind spot, cephalopod eyes, which are only superficially similar, do not. In them, the optic nerve approaches the receptors from behind, so it does not create a break in the retina. The first documented observation of the phenomenon was in the 1660s by Edme Mariotte in France. At the time it was generally thought that the point at which the optic nerve entered the eye should actually be the most sensitive poion of the retina; however, Mariotte's discovery disproved this theory.",

It is broadest in the lower segment of the disc, then above, then nasally and then temporally. It is narrowest in the temporal horizontal disc region in 99.2% of all discs. Compared with the visually normal eyes, glaucomatous neuroretinal rim loss occurred in all sectors of the optic disc with regional preferences depending on the stage of the disease. In the eyes with modest glaucomatous damage, rim loss was usually most pronounced in the inferotemporal disc region. In the eyes with moderately progressed glaucomatous changes, rim was decreased most markedly in the superotemporal sector, then in the temporal horizontal area, the nasal inferior region, and finally in the superior nasal sector. In very advanced glaucoma, rim remnants usually were present only in the nasal disc region. At that stage, they were significantly larger in the superior nasal region than in the nasal inferior area Other than occurring in a diffuse way, glaucomatous neuroretinal rim loss took place in a sequence of sectors. Generally, it began in the inferotemporal disc region and then progressed to the superotemporal, the temporal horizontal, the inferior nasal, and finally the superior nasal sectors. This correlates with the progression of visual field defects and the morphology of the lamina cribrosa. This finding may be impoant for \"early\" glaucoma diagnosis Ref.

PVD with vitreous liquefaction (synchysis) and collapse (synersis) is of common occurrence in majority of the normal subjects above the age of 65 years. It occurs in eyes with senile liquefaction, developing a hole in the posterior hyaloid membrane. The synchytic fluid collects between the posterior hyaloid membrane and the internal limiting membrane of the retina, and leads to PVD up to the base along with collapse of the remaining vitreous gel (synersis). Clinical features: PVD may be associated with flashes of light and floaters. Biomicroscopic examination of the vitreous reveals a collapsed vitreous (synersis) behind the lens and an optically clear space between the detached posterior hyaloid phase and the retina. A ring-like opacity (Weiss ring or Fuchs ring), representing a ring of attachment of vitreous to the optic disc, is pathognomic of PVD. Ref:- A K KHURANA; pg num:-244,245",
