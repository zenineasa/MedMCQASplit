The \"NO SPECS\" scheme is an acronym derived from the following eye changes:0 = No signs or symptoms1 = Only signs (lid retraction or lag), no symptoms2 = Soft-tissue involvement (periorbital edema)3 = Proptosis (>22 mm)4 = Extraocular-muscle involvement (diplopia)5 = Corneal involvement6 = Sight loss",
