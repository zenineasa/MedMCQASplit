Symptoms often occur after reading, computer work, or other close activities that involve tedious visual tasks.When concentrating on a visually intense task, such as continuously focusing on a book or computer monitor, the ciliary muscletightens. This can cause the eyes to get irritated and uncomfortable. Giving the eyes a chance to focus on a distant object at least once an hour usually alleviates the problem.Sometimes, asthenopia can be due to specific visual problems, for example, uncorrected refraction errors or binocular vision problems such as accommodative insufficiency orheterophoria. It is often caused by the viewing of monitors such as those of computers or phones.ESOPHORIAEXOPHORIA* Common in younger group*** Increased accommodation* Excessive use of convergence may cause esophoria(as occurs in bilateral congenital myopes )* Dissociation factor such as prolonged constant use of one eye may result in exophoria (as occurs in individuals using uniocular microscope and watch makers using uniocular magnifying glass)* Elderly* Decreased accommodation* Decreased use of convergence is often associated with exophoria (as seen in presbyopes)Symptoms1.

The incidence of pituitary adenomas presenting as monocular visual field defects was reported to be 9% (in a series of 1,000 patients). If the presenting symptom is sudden monocular visual loss, a pituitary adenoma may be acutely missed, as other more common etiologies are evaluated. Another consideration for sudden monocular visual loss is pituitary apoplexy, though visual field evaluation is often deferred due to the emergent nature of this condition. Monocular temporal hemianopia are not always indicative of a pituitary tumor. These defects, especially in the setting of no Relative afferent pupillary defect or optic atrophy, may suggest functional (non-organic) vision loss. Functional vision loss in the setting of a monocular temporal hemianopsia can be confirmed by the persistence of the temporal hemianopia on binocular visual field testing.> Chiasmal Field Deficits: Characteristically lesions at the level of the optic chiasm produce a bitemporal hemianopia. Pituitary adenomas, which grow upward from the pituitary stalk, compress the chiasm from below, which preferentially involves the inferior, nasal, and macular nerve fibers. This corresponds to superior, bitemporal, and central vision loss. While these field defects typically respect the vertical midline, pituitary adenomas large enough to cause compression tend to also reduce visual acuity and cause diffuse central depression on automated and Goldmann perimetry. In prefixed chiasms or tumors that preferentially grow posteriorly, selective compression of macular fibers may cause a bitemporal hemianopsia involving the central visual field while sparing the peripheral field.> Junctional Field Deficits:- Phenomenon of a central scotoma in one eye with temporal visual field loss in the other eye has been termed a junctional scotoma. Anatomical correlate to this visual field pattern has been suggested by some as compression to an anterior loop to the decus- sating nasal fibers within the posterior optic nerve.> This explanation, called \"Wilbrand's knee,\" is debated within the literature; regardless of the cause, multiple studies nave proven that this visual field phenomenon localizes the lesion to the anterior chiasm and posterior optic nerve.> While junctional field defects have been the presenting sign of pituitary adenomas, it is more commonly seen in other etiologies (meningioma, aneurysm, inflammation).",

This causes persistent corneal epithelial defects and conjunctivization of the corneal epithelium.> Treatment In injury caused by caustics the excess of deleterious material must be removed at the earliest by a copious and immediate irrigation with normal saline. An intra venous infusion line is useful in directing a steady, con trolled flow of saline onto the ocular surface. All fornices should be washed and irrigation continued till the pH returns to normal or for a minimum of 30 minutes. There should be no delay in instituting therapy and, if saline is not immediately available, the eye should be copiously irrigated at once with water. Particles of lime must be perseveringly picked out with forceps after instillation of a local anaesthetic. An antibiotic ointment or drops and cycloplegics should be instilled. Corticosteroids are potent agents in reducing the inflammatory reaction and prevent the formation of excessive granulation tissue, which determines the development of symblepharon. They can be used topically as drops or ointment for the first 10 days, together with acetazolamide tablets to lower the intraocular pressure. Thereafter, steroids are stopped as they impair healing and may precipitate corneal melting.> Ascorbic acid and tetracyclines are given topically and systemically to enhance collagen formation.> To inhibit collagenolysis and stromal damage, 10% sodium citrate, 5% N-acetylcysteine or 1% medroxyprogesterone eye drops are useful adjuncts.> Symblepharon may be prevented by sweeping a glass rod well coated with a lubricant round the upper and lower fornices, so that they are well packed with ointment.> This procedure should be repeated several times a day, depending upon the severity of the case.> The fitting of a contact lens separates the two mucosal surfaces and prevents their adhesion.> Revascularization of the limbus and re-epithelialization of the ocular surface can be stimulated by a limbal cell transplant or amniotic membrane graft.",
