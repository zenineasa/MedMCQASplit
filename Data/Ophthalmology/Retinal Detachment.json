It is also called macular pucker.o Sometimes, as a result of immune system response to protect the retina, cells converge in the macular area as the vitreous ages and pulls away in posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).o PVD can create minor damage to the retina, stimulating exudate, inflammation, and leucocyte response. These cells can form a transparent layer gradually and, like all scar tissue, tighten to create tension on the retina which may bulge and pucker (e.g., macular pucker), or even cause swelling or macular edema.",

However, in certain eyes, strong vitreoretinal adhesions are present and the occurrence of a PVD can lead to a retinal tear formation; then, fluid from the liquefied vitreous can seep under the tear, leading to a retinal detachmentQ.The location of the RRD generally predicts the most likely locations of the retinal break(s).Retinal breaks are usually present superiorly within the area of detachmentQ.Predisposing Factors for Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment* MyopiaQ* Aphakia or pseudophakiaQ* Vitroretinal degenerationQ* Lattice degenerationQ* Snail track degenerationQ* Diffuse chorioretinal atrophyQ* Macular holesQ* Posterior vitreous degenerationQ* Trauma* Vitreous loss during cataract surgeryClinical Features:Early symptoms; Sudden appearance of floaters, frequently associated with fleeting photopsias (flashes), more noticeable in the dark and following rotary eye movementsQSubclinical RRDs can be asymptomatic, and are associated with limited dissection of subretinal fluid (less than two disc diameters from the break).Rarely, but especially in young myopes, slowly progressive asymptomatic retinal detachments develop without PVD, this most commonly occurs temporally and inferiorly and secondary to atrophic holes in lattice degenerationQ.Due to the persistent attachment of the vitreous at the vitreous base after the PVD. most retinal breaks occur anteriorlyQ.The accumulation of subretinal fluid produces relative scotomata that, when the detachment progresses posterior to the equator, can be symptomatic with loss of peripheral vision, producing the sensation that 'curtain is falling' over the visual field.Central visual acuity is lost when subretinal fluid passes beneath the maculaQ.Diagnosis:The majority of causative retinal breaks associated with RRD are found by binocular stereoscopic examination of the entire retina, with scleral indentation of the peripheral retinaQ.Areas of retinal detachment are recognized by elevation of the neural retina from the RPE and loss of pigment epithelial and choroidal detail beneath the elevated retinaQ.In pseudophakic RRD, all breaks may not be visible because of very small tears: and adjunctive treatment maneuvers may be employed at the time of RRD repair (e.g., 360 degree circumferential laser retinopexy).In eyes with opaque media, the presence of a retinal detachment is usually determined ultrasonographically.Treatment:Surgery is the mainstay.Sealing of the break is done followed by pneumatic retinopexy using sulphur hexafluorideQ.",
