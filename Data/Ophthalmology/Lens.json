Human Embryology by IB Singh, 6th/352)LENS# LENS develops from surface ectoderm.# Compared to the cornea, it has a much lower converging power of 17 diopters because of the relatively similar refractive indices of aqueous humor, lens, and vitreous body (cornea 42 D).# However, the lens is the only part of the refractive apparatus that is adjustable.# Adjustment to near vision (accommodation) therefore involves only the lens.# In addition, the lens functions as a UV filter for wavelengths between 300 and 400 nm and thus has a protective function for the macula.# Notching of the lens = \"pseudocoloboma\".# Wilson's disease can induce a yellow-green lens discoloration (chalcosis/ sunflower cataract).# Granular gold deposits located under the lens (chrysiasis lends) can occasionally occur after prolonged treatment with gold preparations (e. g. in primary chronic polyarthritis ).# Other medications, e.g., amiodarone or chlorpromazine, are sometimes deposited in the lens.# In patients with cataract, glittering cholesterol crystals are not infrequently found in the lens (so-called Christmas tree/ decoration cataract).",

It will normally remain unchanged but will migrate into the deeper cortex over time due to the apposition of new fibers.Lamellar (Zonular) cataractIt is the most common developmental cataract.Opacities are located in one layer of lens fibers, often as \"riders\" only in the equatorial region.Nuclear cataractIn the fourth decade of life, the pressure of peripheral lens fiber production causes hardening of the entire lens, especially the nucleus. The nucleus takes on a yellowish brown color (brunescent nuclear cataract). This may range from reddish brown to nearly black discoloration of the entire lens (black cataract). Nuclear cataracts develop very slowly. Due to the lenticular myopia, near vision (even without eyeglasses) remains good for a long time.Cortical cataractNuclear cataracts are often associated with changes in the lens cortex. It is interesting to note that patients with cortical cataracts tend to have acquired hyperopia in contrast to patients with nuclear cataracts, who tend to be myopic.# Berlin's edema (commotio retinae) is a condition caused by blunt injury to the eye. Berlin's edema is an acute traumatic maculopathy characterized by retinal opacification. Histopathologic studies have shown that it is characterized by disruption of photoreceptor outer segments and retinal pigment epithelial damage. OCT an effective tool for management of patients with posterior segment trauma. OCT is more comfortable for the traumatized patient than other imaging techniques because it is a non-contact method utilizing infrared illumination.

        "exp": "Ans. A. UV-A. (Ref Recent advances in ophthalmology/ Issue 7. Pg. 123)Cornea and lens at its ages provide effective filters for UV radiation. However, UVA radiation can penetrate to the retina in pseudophakic individuals.Increase in UV exposure is asso with increased risk for cataracts, corneal photokeratitis (\"snow blindness\"), climate droplet keratopathy, retinal damage (in aphakic individuals) and melanoma of the uveal tract. Ultraviolet rays are shorter in wavelength with a higher frequency than light. The mature ocular lens is a very effective filter for 320 to 400 nm radiation in most mammals (including man) there can be no photobinding of lens proteins and photo- chemotherapeutic drugs like 8-MOP.Most people do not see UV light because the lens absorbs UV. In aphakic patients, \"near\" UV light (300 - 400 nm) can reach visual receptors. Pseudophakia refers to an ocular state in which the natural lens has been replaced with an implanted lens. Apart from the obvious problem of anisometropia, in pseudophakia there is increased risk of retinal exposure to UV light (esp UVA). The natural lens absorbs damaging UV rays, particularly between 300-400 nm and the retina is thus shielded from the potentially damaging radiations.",

In 30 percent cases, polyahritis is associated with hepatosplenomegaly and other systemic features, and the condition is labelled as Still's disease.

Nearly half of the patients are positive for HLA-DW5 and 75 percent are positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA). The onset of uveitis is asymptomatic and the eye is white even in the presence of severe uveitis. Therefore, slit-lamp examination is mandatory in children suffering from JCA.

These patients see better when the pupil is dilated due to dim light in the evening (day blindness).

Therefore, sutureless surgery is possible with self-sealing scleral tunnel or clear corneal incision made with a 3 mm keratome. 2. Continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis (CCC) of 4-6 mm. 3. Hydrodissection i.e., separation of capsule from the coex by injecting fluid exactly between the two is must for phacoemulsification in SICS. This procedure facilitates nucleus rotation and manipulation during phacoemulsification. Some surgeons also perform hydrodelineation 4. Nucleus is emulsified and aspirated by phacoemulsifier. Phacoemulsifier basically acts through a hollow 1-mm titanium needle which vibrates by piezoelectric crystal in its longitudinal axis at an ultrasonic speed of 40000 times a second and thus emulsifies the nucleus. 5. Remaining coical lens matter is aspirated with the help of an irrigation-aspiration technique. 6. Next steps i.e., IOL implantation, removal of viscoelastic substance and wound closure.

Goniotomy Surgical procedure for congenital glaucoma In this procedure a Barkan&;s goniotomy knife is passed through the limbus on the temporal side. Under gonioscopic control the knife is passed across the anterior chamber to the nasal pa of the angle. An incision is made in the angle approximately midway between root of the iris and Schwalbe&;s ring through approximately 75deg. The knife is then withdrawn. Although the procedure may have to be repeated, the eventual success rate is about 85 percent. Phacoemulsification Phacoemulsification is a technique of extracapsular cataract extraction in which after the removal of anterior capsule (by capsulorhexis), the lens nucleus is emulsified and aspirated by the probe of a phacoemulsification machine.

These include uveal inflammations (like iridocyclitis, parsplanitis, choroiditis), hypopyon corneal ulcer and endophthalmitis. 2. Degenerative conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa and other pigmentary retinal dystrophies and myopic chorioretinal degeneration. 3. Retinal detachment. 4. Glaucoma (primary or secondary). 5. Intraocular tumours such as retinoblastoma or melanoma may give rise to complicated cataract in late stages. Clinical features: Typically the complicated cataract stas as posterior coical cataract. Lens changes appear typically in front of the posterior capsule. The opacity is irregular in outline and variable in density. In the beam of slit- lamp the opacities have an appearance like 'bread- crumb'. A very characteristic sign is the appearance of iridescent coloured paicles the so-called 'polychromatic lustre' of reds, greens and blues. A diffuse yellow-haze is seen in the adjoining coex. Slowly the opacity spreads in the rest of the coex, and finally the entire lens becomes opaque, giving chalky white appearance. Deposition of calcium is common in the later stages.
