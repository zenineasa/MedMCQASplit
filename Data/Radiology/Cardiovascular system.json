        "question": "What is the MOST common radiographic manifestation of acute papillary muscle rupture?",
        "exp": "The papillary muscles are connected to the mitral valve leaflets by the chordae tendinae. When there is rupture of the chordae tendinae or the papillary muscle itself, the mitral valve is unable to function properly, resulting in mitral regurgitation. Because this is an acute process, accommodation does not occur, resulting in acute pulmonary edema. Edema predominantly affecting the right upper lobe can be seen if the jet of regurgitant blood is directed into the right superior pulmonary vein, which drains the right upper lobe. The left atrium will enlarge over time in the setting of mitral valve regurgitation due to the increased volume of blood that is directed into the left atrium during systole. However, this change occurs over time and will not be seen in the setting of acute papillary muscle rupture. The left ventricle will enlarge oveime in the setting of mitral valve regurgitation because it receives an increased volume of blood from the left atrium - both the volume of blood returning from the lung as well as the regurgitant volume of blood through the mitral valve. As with left atrial enlargement, left ventricular enlargement will occur over time but will not be seen in the setting of acute papillary muscle rupture. Pericardial effusion can occur in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction due to inflammation of the pericardium. Dressler syndrome, thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response to myocardial neo-antigens, is not an acute process and, when present, occurs several weeks following a myocardial infarction. However, it is not the most common radiographic manifestation of acute papillary muscle rupture.",

The hyperinflation of the lungs in this case represents emphysema as the cause of the pulmonary aerial hypeension. Pulmonary venous hypeension occurs when the left ventricle is unable to pump the volume of blood that it receives. This results in elevated left atrial pressures and pulmonary venous hypeension.

        "exp": "The cardiac silhouette is large, with prominent pulmonary vasculature and increased vascular markings in the lower and lateral poions of the hemithorax. Transverse lines can be seen in the lateral one-third of the lower right lung zone. These are Kerley B lines and are indicative of interstitial pulmonary edema. There is straightening of the left hea border from the aoic shadow, called mitralization of the hea. The carinal angle appears to be about 90deg which is wider than normal, also suggesting an enlarged subcarinal left atrial appendage. This chest x-ray is consistent with pulmonary edema and left atrial and left ventricular enlargement. The CXR shows acute pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly. Bilateral airspace densities are noted. Pulmonary edema is the result of increased pulmonary venous pressures, i.e., hydrostatic edema, which can be due to volume overload or congestive hea failure. This is usually associated with cardiomegaly, although the hea size may be normal in acute myocardial infarction or acute valvular dysfunction. Impaired pulmonary venous return due to left ventricular failure or mitral valve disease leads to increased pulmonary blood volume. Signs of cephalization of blood flow suggest enlargement of upper lobe pulmonary vessels. Mitral stenosis is one of the cardiac causes for elevated pulmonary venous pressure, although it has become relatively uncommon. The wellknown radiographic signs of pulmonary edema are cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, and vascular congestion. Interstitial edema can be seen with blurring of the margins of blood vessels around the bronchial wall--called peribronchial cuffing--and in the subpleural position--called Kerley B lines. As capillary pressure rises, accumulated fluid in the interstitium adds to the interstitial pressure, forcing fluid into the alveolar space. Differentiation between pulmonary edema due to increased circular blood volume and that due to a failing left ventricle can be made on the basis of measurement of the vascular pedicle if the technique is not flawed. The radiographic differentiation of hydrostatic pulmonary edema from increased capillary permeability is also difficult. The criteria used are cardiac size, vascular distribution, and measurement of the vascular pedicle; this test has a predictive value of 75%. Some authors believe that the best sign of hydrostatic pulmonary edema is an abnormal right costophrenic angle containing Kerley B lines, subpleural edema, and pleural effusion. Those patients who have increased capillary permeability frequently have normal right costophrenic angles. The other most useful sign is the presence of an air bronchogram in increased capillary permeability edema and its absence in hydrostatic edema. The diagnosis of mitral stenosis is associated with a diastolic rumble on physical exam. The first hea sound is loud and there is no clubbing or koilonychia. Mitral stenosis may be complicated by atrial arrhythmias, hemoptysis secondary to left ventricular failure, or endocarditis. Atrial myxoma is not a complication but may mimic signs and symptoms of mitral stenosis. The radiographic sign suggestive of an atrial enlargement is a widened carinal angle.",

There is a linear hyperlucent margin along the left cardiac border, suggesting an air-soft tissue interface. This is seen in pneumopericardium. The chest x-ray shows a pneumopericardium. This refers to the presence of air within the pericardial sac. Pathologically, air can enter the pericardium from the mediastinum near the pulmonary veins. Air can also develop within the pericardium due to production by gas-forming organisms in cases of infection. At times the pneumopericardium may be complicated by the presence of fluid (hydropneumopericardium) or pus (pyopneumopericardium). Closed chest injury with or without perforation of the pericardium is the most frequent nonsurgical cause associated with this kind of pattern. Contiguous organ involvement (pulmonary abscess, bronchogenic carcinoma, esophagitis, perforated gastric ulcer, foreign body) also can result in the involvement of the pericardium and hence cause pneumopericardium. Septicemia causing direct seeding of the pericardial space can also produce a common communication with the lung. With pneumopericardium, the lucent halo of air paially or completely surrounds the hea but does not extend superiorly to the attachments of the pericardium, and the concomitant subcutaneous emphysema is absent. If supine and erect radiographs are obtained, pericardial air will immediately shift in location whereas mediastinal air change will not occur.The \"continuous diaphragm sign\" is seen in pneumomediastinum. In this sign, the right and the left hemidiaphragms appear continuous due to mediastinal air present along the diaphragm and below the hea, giving the appearance of a single continuous diaphragm. Both adults and children can develop life-threatening cardiac tamponade due to pneumopericardium. A pericardial rub is a sign of pericarditis and is usually not heard once an effusion develops. The Hamman sign is a crunching noise heard with the apex beat and heard best in the left lateral decubitus position. It is seen in 50% of cases of mediastinal emphysema (pneumomediastinum) and is associated with subcutaneous emphysema in the suprasternal notch.

There is a convex outward opacity in the region of the left ventricle with a peripheral rim of calcification. It is contiguous with the cardiac shadow and represents a left ventricular aneurysm. Left ventricular aneurysm is usually secondary to myocardial infarction and may calcify. A true aneurysmal dilatation occurs anterolaterally and may require elective surgery. False aneurysms occur posteriorly and usually signify a contained rupture, which requires emergent surgical resection. In this case, the chest x-ray and the history of previous myocardial infarction make option d the best answer.",
