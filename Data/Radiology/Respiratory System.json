It is the most common inherited lung disease in whites with associated gene mutation. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation and excessive chloride secretion in the sweat glands. Pulmonary manifestations include recurrent pneumonia with mucus plugging and increased morbidity and moality due to staphylococcal and pseudomonas infection. Complications may include pneumothorax, rupture of a subpleural bleb, hemoptysis, lung abscesses, and empyema. Massive hemoptysis and cor pulmonale may cause respiratory failure and increase moality",

The physical signs are inconsistent with an infectious process. The CXR shows hilar, paratracheal LN, and parenchymal disease. Sarcoidosis may be associated with uveitis, skin lesions, bony cysts, and hypercalcemia, which is due to abnormal vitamin D metabolism. Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology characterized pathologically by widespread development of noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas, which may resolve or conve to fibrous tissue. The disease most commonly affects hilar lymph nodes and lungs, but uveitis and involvement of other organs such as the liver, spleen, skin, bone, and salivary glands are not rare. Lab studies may show anemia, leukopoenia, elevated SED rates, blood eosinophilia, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and elevated levels of serum angiotensin-conveing enzymes. Half of the cases are detected incidentally on chest radiograph. Patients with adenopathy alone are usually asymptomatic, althoughpatients with pulmonary involvement may experience weight loss, fatigue, fever, cough, or shoness of breath. Hemoptysis is rare unless it is associated with end-stage sarcoidosis and a superimposed mycetoma. The disease is most common in African Americans, Pueo Ricans, and West Indians. Women are more susceptible than men. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by transbronchial biopsy, which can demonstrate granulomas despite the absence of radiographic evidence of this peribronchial disease. Adenopathy is the most common manifestation. Symmetrical, hilar, and classically right paratracheal involvement is seen. Unilateral hilar adenopathy is seen in less than 5% of cases. Peripheral \"eggshell\" lymph node calcification is occasionally seen. Pleural effusion is rare. Radiographic staging of sarcoid is as follows: Stage 0: normal finding, 10% at presentation, with the primary problem being nonpulmonary Stage 1: adenopathy without pulmonary disease, 50% at presentation Stage 2: adenopathy with pulmonary disease, 30% at presentation Stage 3: pulmonary disease without adenopathy, 10% at presentation Stage 4: pulmonary fibrosis, usually as a sequel to stage 3, rare at presentation Stage 1 disease resolves within a few years in most patients, and less than one-third of patients with stage I disease develop lung disease. Adenopathy is usually present when there is pulmonary disease. The lung involvement results from deposition of noncaseating granulomas along the lymphatic lining of the bronchial vascular bundles and interlobular septa. Findings include small, irregular interstitial and subpleural nodules throughout the lungs. Confluent interstitial infiltrates may be asymmetric, and cavitation is rare. The midzone and upper zone are most commonly involved, whereas the lung periphery and the bases are generally spared. Pulmonary involvement usually resolves but does progress to fibrosis in less than 20% of the cases, with architectural distoion, traction, and pleural thickening. The distribution is often patchy, in contrast to the peripheral lower lobe distribution of IPF. Occasionally, pulmonary sarcoidosis may appear as ground-glass opacities, patchy consolidation, or rounded \"cannonball\" infiltrates described as alveolar sarcoid.",

The diagnosis of M. avium disease (MAC) is established by fulfilling clinical radiographic and culture criteria. The diagnosis should be suspected with symptoms of cough, fever, and weight loss with progressive infiltrates, cavitation, and multiple nodules. Patients without underlying lung disease who have chronic pulmonary infections are predominantly women and nonsmokers. High-resolution CT scan typically shows multiple small nodules with bronchiectasis. The diagnosis must be established bacteriologically since some nontuberculous mycobacteria are commonly found in nature and contamination of specimen can occur. Therefore, the diagnosis of MOTT pulmonary disease requires the following: three positive cultures with negative AFP smears; two positive cultures and one positive smear; a single bronchial specimen with a positive culture of 2 to 4+ growth; a positive AFB smear and a positive culture of any biopsy specimen; granuloma by biopsy with one positive culture from any respiratory specimen; or a growth of MAC from any usually sterile extrapulmonary site. Although transient infection with spontaneous resolution occurs, significant growth on culture means disease is present. Mycobacterial disease due to nontuberculous mycobacteria is now more common than tuberculosis in the United States. It is generally prevalent in specific areas such as the Southeast and the Gulf Coast region. According to the CDC, one-third to onefouh of all isolates of mycobacteria are due to nontuberculous mycobacteria. Natural waters appear to be the likely environmental source of these organisms, which can be isolated from tap water or even hospital water. Person-to-person transmission is thought to be unlikely. Clinical syndromes of MAI disease in nonimmune non-HIV individuals occur in older patients, paicularly smokers and alcoholics with COPD. These syndromes may present as upper lobe infiltrates or cavitary or solitary nodules.Patients can develop chronic bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis. In nonsmoking women older than 50, multiple small and medium-sized nodules may be seen. Upper lobe or lingular infiltrates have been described. Coughing and purulent sputum for an average of 6 mo may be present.",

Note that the right apex and lower lung zones are clear. The left lung is also clear, and no pleural or mediastinal disease is noted. This x-ray is consistent with a necrotizing process in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, with an air-fluid level such as in a lung abscess. The presence of a subacute illness with foul-smelling sputum and clubbing is a classical presentation for a lung abscess, which is caused by mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection. Pneumococcal pneumonia generally does not produce a necrotizing picture, and PCP in an immune-compromised patient usually appears as a diffuse reticular pattern, but cystic and cavitary areas may be present. A lung abscess represents a localized area of lung necrosis with a thick wall and an acute angle to the chest wall. An air-fluid level is seen, representing a communication with the bronchial tree. The fluid level diameter is usually similar on PA and lateral chest films with a lung abscess and is often considerably different with empyema. Differentiation between an empyema and a lung abscess is crucial since the former requires tube thoracostomy, while the latter is adequately treated with antibiotics and postural drainage. Immediate bronchoscopy may not be needed unless an endobronchial obstruction is suspected or there is a history of choking or aspiration. Contrast CT scans may be helpful to see the split pleural sign with marked visceral and parietal pleural thickening in an empyema.",

Based on the history and CXR, the next diagnostic step should be",
        "exp": "This x-ray shows a cystic opacity in the left lower lobe behind the hea obscuring the left diaphragm but not obscuring the left hea border. These cystic-appearing shadows originate from the left lower lobe bronchus. This picture is consistent either with left lower lobe bronchiectasis or sequestration of the lung. The chest x-ray and clinical history suggest bronchiectasis of the left lower lobe. Bronchograms are not done anymore because of frequent complications and the fact that a CT scan can confirm the diagnosis. Bronchoscopy would not reveal any additional information unless there is a history of foreign body aspiration. Determination of immunoglobulin levels would be helpful in a patient with chronic generalized or multilobar infection or frequent skin infections. The differential diagnosis in this case would include pulmonary sequestration, which could present with a similar radiological picture. A pulmonary sequestration is an abnormal embryonic lung tissue that is segregated from the tracheal bronchial system and does not communicate through normal bronchus. Since the sequestrated lung is cystic, it does not function normally. There are two types of pulmonary sequestration. Intralobar sequestrations, seen most frequently in adults, are located within the visceral pleura and are contained within the lung parenchyma. Extralobar sequestrations, which are located outside the visceral pleura, have their own separate pleural covering. The most common location for intralobar sequestration is the posterior basilar segments of the lower lobe. It is characterized by bronchiectasis with cystic areas containing mucus or mucopurulent material, and is lined with ciliated columnar or cuboidal epithelium. The walls may contain cailage and glands. In the adult, multifocal epithelial changes can occur, and dysplastic or carcinomatotic changes have been repoed within intralobar sequestrations. The most common site of the region of the anomalous aerial supply in pulmonary sequestration is the thoracic aoa, followed by the abdominal aoa and intercostal aeries. Cough and hemoptysis may be the initial symptoms. On plain x-ray, intralobar sequestration appears as a solid or cystic mass located in the lower lobe. Air-fluid levels are seen and may be mistaken for pneumonia, bronchiectasis, or abscess formation. Bronchoscopy reveals no abnormality, and for a definitive diagnosis of sequestration it is impoant to demonstrate the systemic aerial supply. CT scan or aoography can accomplish this. Untreated sequestration has an associated morbidity related to infection, vascular shunting and hemoptysis; thus, resection is the treatment of choice.",

However, congestive atelectasis, as mentioned in the previous question, moderate bloody pleural effusion, and nodular or patchy infiltrates can be seen. In some cases unilateral oligemia (Westermark sign) is recognized. Hampton's hump is a term used to define pulmonary lobules filled with blood. These are triangular pleural-based infiltrates with their apex toward the hilum. The increased alveolar aerial gradient seen on the aerial blood gas study suggests a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch and rules out an acute anxiety state as the cause of the symptoms. Although the patient has a history of bronchial asthma, the lung exam reveals no wheezing or expiratory prolongation and symptoms have been well controlled. Peak flows are satisfactory and hence an acute asthmatic attack is unlikely.

The upper left ribs are abnormal and the chest wall is depressed. These changes are a sequela to lung collapse therapy with thoracoplasty Thoracoplasty is the excision of substantial segments of the bony thorax to reduce its size. The indication for thoracoplasty in this case was unilateral cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis that had not responded to other forms of treatment. Occasionally, thoracoplasty is still done to obliterate empyema cavities. Following thoracoplasty, large tuberculous cavities heal by organization of granulation tissue and the contracted tissue becomes encased in a thick pleural membrane. Associated pleural calcification and thickening are seen.",

On physical examination his vital signs are: pulse 110 bpm; temperature normal; respirations 30/min with use of accessory muscles and pursed-lip breathing; blood pressure 110/78 mm Hg. Other peinent findings are: hea exam: apex beat (impulse) is medial to the midclavicular line with generalized decreased breath sounds on lung exam; ABGs (FiO2 0.21): pH 7.38; PCO2 47 mm Hg; PO2 67 mm Hg. PFTs/spirometry: FVC 2.80 L (67% of predicted); FEV1 1.56 (50% of predicted); FEV1/FVC% 56%; TLC 134% of predicted; RV 170% of predicted; DLCO 43% of predicted. There is no reversibility with bronchodilators. Chest radiograph are shown below.What is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "These x-rays show a marked degree of hyperinflation depicted radiographically by increased lung volume with flattened diaphragm and widened interspaces. Attenuation of the pulmonary vasculature in the peripheral lung zones, especially in the lower zones, is seen.These x-ray are consistent with severe emphysema. The lower lobe accentuation of hyperinflation is consistent with a1 antitrypsin deficiency causing panacinar emphysema. The physical signs and CXR suggest emphysema. This is confirmed by an obstructive ventilatory impairment with hyperinflation, air trapping, and reduced diffusion. In bronchial asthma, there would typically be marked bronchodilator response, and the patient with chronic bronchitis would present with chronic sputum production. Tuberous sclerosis presents radiographically as hyperinflation and lower zone infiltrates, but clinically is a systemic disease with a clinical triad of mental retardation, seizure disorder, and dermal angiofibromas called adenoma sebaceum. Pulmonary disease is rare (it is seen in less than 1% of cases) and presents with pneumothoraces and hemoptysis. Pulmonary emphysema is a chronic condition characterized by irreversible enlargement of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles with destruction of the alveolar walls and intraalveolar septa. It results in a loss of lung elastic recoil causing airflow obstruction, air trapping, and hyperinflation. Pulmonary function tests reveal an obstructive pattern with elevated total lung capacity, increased residual volume, and decreased diffusion capacity. Chest x-ray reveals all signs of hyperinflation as illustrated above. CT scan is the most sensitive imaging modality to reliably detect emphysema. Although pulmonary aery enlargement and mild pulmonary aerial hypeension are common in advanced emphysema, radiographic evaluation of pulmonary aery size is a poor indicator of PA pressures. Other concomitant pulmonary disease processes such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema may present in an atypical fashion in a patient with emphysema. Forms of emphysema include the following: 1. Centrilobular emphysema is the most common form, found predominantly in cigarette smokers. The destructive process begins with involvement of the center of the secondary lobule and extends into the lung parenchyma. The upper lobes are more frequently involved. 2. Panacinar emphysema begins with the involvement of the entire secondary lobule with diffuse, widespread lung destruction. It is seen in a1 antitrypsin deficiency and has lower zone predominance. 3. Paraseptal emphysema refers to peripheral lung destruction adjacent to the visceral pleura and interlobular septa. Progressive dyspnea associated with increasing paraseptal emphysema forming bullae refers to the \"vanishing lung syndrome\" 4. Congenital emphysema is seen in the first few months of life and refers to a large hyperlucent lobe associated with compressive and mass effect on the adjacent structures. 5. Compensatory emphysema refers to hyperlucent and hyperinflated airspaces adjacent to areas of deformity, atelectasis, or resection of lung and represents overexpansion without actual lung destruction. 6. Scar emphysema is associated with conditions of fibrosis and scarring and associated honeycombing as in stage 4 sarcoidosis or chronic inflammatory conditions.",

        "exp": "These x-rays show a large area of hyperlucency with no lung markings in the right upper and middle zone bounded by a very distinct margin. The area below the margin shows increased density and compression. There is attenuation of vascular markings and increased lucency in the left upper zone also. This is consistent with a large bulla in the right upper lobe and a smaller bulla in the left upper lobe. The CXR shows a large bulla, which accounts for the symptoms of this patient. Discrepancy in total lung capacity as assessed by the helium dilution and body plethysmography methods suggests significant gas trapping in the bulla and can be used to estimate the volume of the bulla. Bullae become symptomatic as they enlarge, and the goal of surgical therapy is to excise them to enable the surrounding tissue to reexpand. CT scan is helpful to determine the size, extent, and number of bullae present. It also helps in evaluating the anatomy of the remaining lung and its potential for effective reexpansion. PFTs may show a restrictive pattern if the bulla does not communicate with the airways. If there is no diffuse, widespread emphysema and profound hypoxemia or hypercarbia is not present, surgical resection of the bulla is likely to improve the symptoms. Placement of a chest tube in this case would conve an intrapulmonary closed airspace into a bronchopleural cutaneous fistula and is therefore not an appropriate option.",

        "exp": "This is a PA, slightly lordotic chest film, although there is some failure to fully abduct the scapula. The left hemithorax is markedly hyperlucent; there is some widening of the interspaces with a depressed diaphragm and air under the hea shadow. There is a large bandlike shadow extending from the apex of the left lung down to the bottom of the hea with silhouetting of the left cardiac border. This represents a total lung collapse with atelectasis; however, some of the air totally surrounds the lung with hyperlucency around the aoic knob. Most pneumothoraces usually show a sharp edge differentiating the free air in the pleural space from the normal pulmonary parenchyma, with a line representing the pleural surfaces. In this paicular case, because of marked collapse with circumferential air, one does not see the sharp line and observes bilateral edges, i.e., differences in contrast between a more radiodense and radiolucent back-ground. The very sharp edge along the left hea border represents the contrast between the collapsed lung and the pleural space and is called the visceral pleural line. The chest wall appears irregular along the level of lateral 6th to 7th ribs, probably representing a rib fracture. The acute onset of severe shoness of breath and left-sided chest pain suggests concurrent pleural disease as pa of the differential diagnosis. This is confirmed by the chest x-ray showing a left-sided pneumothorax. Patients with COPD and/or bullous disease have chronic symptoms. With an acute exacerbation of COPD, the chest x-ray is helpful in distinguishing a pneumothorax vs. pneumonia. On physical exam, patients with pneumothorax present with absent breath sounds and hyperresonance on the side of the pneumothorax. The other physical findings mentioned are not characteristic of pneumothorax. Management of a symptomatic patient with a large pneumothorax is by inseion of a chest tube.",

The clinical hints that aid diagnosis include: An occupational history without constitutional symptoms. X-ray that looks worse than the patient's complaints, as in sarcoidosis. History of thromboembolic disease or sepsis, as in septic emboli or pulmonary infarcts. These are generally seen in the lower lung zones. * History of ahritis; may suggest rheumatoid nodules.
