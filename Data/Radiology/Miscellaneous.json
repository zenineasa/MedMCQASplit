Hepatic fibrosis with hepatic cysts is known association. In the kidney, epithelial hyperplasia occurs along the collecting duct of the nephron. The hyperplastic cells undergo a functional change from being resorptive to becoming secretory. The fluid secreted from these abnormal cells is rich in epithelial growth factors, which further stimulate epithelial proliferation. The combination of epithelial hyperplasia and fluid secretion results in significant ductal ectasia. Approximately 10-90% of the ducts may be affected, resulting in a wide variability of renal dysfunction. Depending on the number of ducts involved, the kidneys may be massively enlarged.",

Although they might be very large in size, they do not cause any mass effect unless they bleed. Following contrast administration, and especially with CTA the diagnosis is usually self evident with feeding arteries, nidus and draining veins visible in the so-called \"bag of worm\" appearance. The exact anatomy of feeding vessels and draining veins can be difficult to delineate, and thus, angiography remains necessary.# MRI: Fast flow generates flow voids easily seen on T2 weighted images. Complications including previous haemorrhage and adjacent oedema may be evident.# MRA: phase contrast MR angiography is often useful to subtract the haematoma components when an AVM complicated by an acute haemorrhage needs to be imaged# Angiography (DSA) Remains the gold standard, able to exquisitely delineate the location and number of feeding vessels and the pattern of drainage. Ideally, angiography is performed in a bi-plane system with a high rate of acquisition, as the shunts can be very rapid.
