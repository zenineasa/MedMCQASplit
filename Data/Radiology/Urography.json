Small bowel can dilate up to around 50mm. If the small bowel has a diameter of 70mm orgreater it probably isn't small bowel.The 3.6.9 Rule: The maximum diameter of the bowel is shown below Maximum Normal DiameterSmall bowel30 mmLarge bowel50-60 mmCaecum90 mmStep ladder pattern: (Blue arrows) The appearance of multiple air-fluid levels on erect abdominal film is sometimes referred to as a step ladder sign. It has also been suggested that uneven levels in a bowel loop (i.e. more fluid on one side of the loop than the other) is diagnostic of SBO rather than ileus.Stretch/slit sign: Slit sign is a result of small amounts of air caught in the valvulae of fluid-filled bowel.String of pearls/ beads sign: (white arrow) The appearance is considered to be diagnostic of obstruction (as opposed to ileus) and is caused by small bubbles of air trapped in the valvulae of the small bowel. A similar appearance is sometimes seen in the large bowel but can usually be differentiated by the fact that the gas bubbles are largerCoiled spring sign: (red circle) The coiled spring appearance only occurs in the dilated air-filled small bowel. It also is most noticeable in the jejunum where the valvulae conniventes are closely spaced.",

The presence of this cobra head appearance is an indicator of uncomplicated ureterocele.A ureterocele is a submucosal cystic dilation of the terminal segment of the ureter.It may be classified most easily as intravesical, defined by its presence entirely within the bladder, or extravesical, defined by the permanent presence of some portion of the ureterocele at the bladder neck or urethra.",

Only 1 to 5% nephron will develop cysts.The cyst contain straw coloured fluid that may become haemorrhagic.Genetic ConsiderationOver 90% of cases are inherited as an AD-trait , with the remainder likely representing spontaneous mutations. Two form of ADPKD has been identified.ADPKD-1 accounts for 85% of cases & the gene has been mapped to chromosome 16p13.3. ADPKD-2 accounts for remainder cases & the gene has been mapped to chromosome 4q 21-23.ADPKD-2 appear to have a later age of onset of symptoms & renal failure than ADPKD-1.Radiological Feature Rim / Cresent Sign HydronephrosisSoap Bubble appearanceHydronephrosisSpider leg appearancePolycystic kidneyFlower vase appearance of ureterHorse shoe kidneyDrooping flower appearanceEctopic ureterCobra head appearanceUreterocoeThimble biadderTubercular cystic (chronic)Sandy patchesSchistosomiasis of bladderFish hook bladderBPH",
