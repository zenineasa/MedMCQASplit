The mid portion represents the coarc ted segment'E' Sign or 'Reverse Three sign': Seen in barium swallow due above aortic shadowsRib notching: Bilateral rib notching is seen between the third and eighth posterior ribs along its lower border usually after the age of 9 years.Unilateral rib notching: A feature of coarctation, if it involves the origin of the left subclavian artery also.Differential diagnosis for rib-notchingRib notching is also seen in the following conditionsChronic superior vena cava obstructionChronic inferior vena cava obstructionAortoarteritis in rare occasionIntercostal neurofibromatosisIntercostal arteriovenous malformationsPost Blalock-Tausig shunt",
