Malnutrition in India is mainly attributed to kwashiorkar, marasmus, xerophthalmia, nutritional anemia and endemic goitre. Iron deficiency anemia is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency affecting all age groups in India. The effects are direct and indirect. Direct effects are occurence of frank and subclinical nutrition deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkar, marasmus, vitamin and mineral deficiency. Indirect effects are a high morbidity and moality among young children retarded physical and mental growth. Malnutrition predisposes to infection and infection to malnutrition. Waterlow&;s classification of PEM: It defines two groups- 1. Malnutrition with a retarded growth, in which a drop in height/age ratio points to a chronic condition - shoness/stunting. It is an index of duration of malnutrition 2. Malnutrition with a low weight fir a normal height, in ehich the weight for height ratio is indicative of acute condition of rapid weight loss/ wasting . It is an index of severity of malnutrition. Classification of grades of PEM is given by ICMR. IAP Classification of malnutrition: Based on % of ideal weight expected for the age. 1. Normal : >80% 2. Grade 1 PEM: 71-80% 3. Grade 2 PEM:61-70% 4. Grade 3 PEM:51-60% 5. Grade 4 PEM:<50% {Reference: Park&;s textbook of community medicine 23 rd edition, pg no. 640}",

        "exp": "Deficiency of Vitamin A The signs of vitamin A deficiency are predominantly ocular. They include nightblindness, conjunctiva) xerosis, Bitot's spots, corneal xerosis and keratomalacia. The term \"xerophthalmia\" (dry eye) comprises all the ocular manifestations of vitamin A deficiency ranging from nightblindness to keratomalacia, Given below is a sho description of the ocular manifestations. (a) Nightblindness Lack of vitamin A, first causes nightblindness or inability to see in dim light. The mother herself can detect this condition when her child cannot see in late evenings or find her in a darkened room. Nightblindness is due to impairment in dark adaptation. Unless vitamin A intake is increased, the condition may get worse, especially when children also suffer from diarrhoea and other infections. (b) Conjunctiva xerosis This is the first clinical sign of vitamin A deficiency. Theconjuctiva becomes dry and non-wettable. Instead of looking smooth and shiny, it appears muddy and wrinkled. It has been well described as \"emerging like sand banks at receding tide\" when the child ceases to cry. (c) Bitot's spots Bitot's spots are triangular, pearly-white or yellowish, foamy spots on the bulbar conjunctiva on either side of the cornea. They are frequently bilateral. Bitot's spots in young children usually indicate vitamin A deficiency. In older individuals, these spots are often inactive sequelae of earlier disease. (d)Corneal xerosis This stage is paicularly serious. The cornea appears dull, dry and non-wettable and eventually opaque. It does not have a moist appearance. In more severe deficiency there may be corneal ulceration. The ulcer may heal leaving a corneal scar which can affect vision. (e) Keratomalacia Keratomalacia or liquefaction of the cornea is a grave medical emergency. The cornea (a pa or the whole) may become soft and may burst open. The process is a rapid one. If the eye collapses, vision is lost. EXTRA-OCULAR MANIFESTATIONS These comprise follicular hyperkeratosis, anorexia and growth retardation which have long been recognized. They are non-specific and difficult to quantify. Recent studies seem to indicate that even mild vitamin A deficiency causes an increase in morbidity and moality due to respiratory and intestinal infection . Deficiency of vitamin A has recently been linked to child moality Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 654",

Khesari dhal (lathyrus sativus), is consumed in pas of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, excessive consumption of which is associated with lathyrism. Pulses contain 20 to 25 per cent of proteins, which is double that found in wheat and three times that found in rice. II') fact, pulses contain more protein than eggs, fish or flesh foods. But in regard to quality, pulse proteins are inferior to animal proteins. Pulse proteins are poor in methionine and to a lesser extent in cysteine. On the other hand they are rich in lysine. Soyabean is exceptionally rich in protein, containing up to 40 per cent. In addition, pulses are rich in minerals and B-group vitamins such as riboflavin and thiamine. In the dry state, pulses do not contain vitamin C. Germinating pulses, however, contain higher concentration of vitamins, especially vitamin C and B vitamins. Fermentation also modifies the nutritive value of pulses .in that the vitamin content paicularly that of riboflavin, thiamine and niacin is enhanced.

        "exp": "Egg Egg contains all the nutrients except carbohydrate and vitamin C. About 12 per cent of egg is made of shell, 58 per cent of egg white, and 30 per cent of egg yolk. An egg weighing 60 grams contains 6 g of protein, 6 g of fat, 30 mg of calcium and 1.5 mg of iron, and supplies about 70 kcal of energy. Egg proteins have all the nine essential amino acids needed by the body in right propoions. Nutritionists consider egg protein as the best among food proteins. In fact, egg protein is the standard against which the quality of other proteins is compared. Except for vitamin C, egg contains all the fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins in appreciable amounts. Impoant minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc and other trace elements are present in the egg. Barring milk, no other food can supply such a diverse range of nutrients. Net protein utilization (NPU) which combines in a single value the biological value and digestibility, is 100 for egg compared to 80 for meat and 75 for milk. Raw egg white is not assimilated by the intestinal mucosa, therefore it must be cooked before consumption. Boiling destroys 'avidin', a substance which prevents the body from obtaining biotin, one of the B-complex vitamins. Boiled egg is therefore nutritionally superior to raw egg. In recent years the cholesterol content of egg (250 mg/egg) has generated a sense of fear because of the risk of CHD . A reduction in intake of eggs is advised for those at risk of CHD. This should not distract others from eating eggs. Eggs or no eggs, cholesterol is formed in the body endogenously and is controlled by what is known as feedback mechanism.

Malnutrition in India is mainly attributed to kwashiorkar, marasmus, xerophthalmia, nutritional anemia and endemic goitre. Iron deficiency anemia is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency affecting all age groups in India. The effects are direct and indirect. Direct effects are occurence of frank and subclinical nutrition deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkar, marasmus, vitamin and mineral deficiency. Indirect effects are a high morbidity and moality among young children retarded physical and mental growth. Malnutrition predisposes to infection and infection to malnutrition.

Surveys, however, indicated that the problem of goitre and iodine deficiency disorders was more widespread than it was thought earlier, with nearly 145 million people estimated to be living in known goitre endemic areas of the country.

A balanced diet has become an accepted means to safeguard a population from nutritional deficiencies. In constructing balanced diet, the following principles should be borne in mind : (a) First and foremost, the daily requirement of protein should be met. This amounts to 10-15 per cent of the daily energy intake. (b) Next comes the fat requirement, which should be limited to 15-30 per cent of the daily energy intake (c) Carbohydrates rich in natural fibre should constitute the remaining food energy. The dietary pattern varies widely in different pas of the world. It is generally developed around the kinds of food produced (or impoed) depending upon the climatic conditions of the region, economic capacity, religion, customs, taboos, tastes and habits of the people. It takes into account 95-98% of population. Balanced diets formulated by the Indian Council of Medical Research are given in Annexure II at the end of this chapter.

Foodgrains such as bajra, rye, sorghum, and wheat have a tendency to get infested during the flowering stages by the ergot fungus (Claviceps purpurea). Fungus grows as a blackish mass and the seeds become black and irregular and are harvested along with food grains. Consumption of ergot infested grain leads to ergotism. Sporadic outbreaks of ergot poisoning in human population have been repoed from time to time in areas where bajra is consumed as a staple. The symptoms are acute but rarelyfatal and include nausea, repeated vomiting, giddiness and drowsiness extending sometimes for periods upto 24 to 48 hours after the ingestion of ergoty grain. In chronic cases, painful cramps in limbs and peripheral gangrene due to vasoconstriction of capillaries have been repoed. However, the long-term effects of consuming small amounts of the Toxin are not known. A disquieting feature is that the recently introduced high-yielding varieties of bajra are more susceptible to infestation. Ergot-infested grains can be easily removed by floating them in 20 per cent salt water. They can also be removed by hand-picking or air floatation. The upper safe limit for the ergot alkaloids has been estimated to be 0.05 mg per 100 grams of the food material. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 694",

Malnutrition in India is mainly attributed to kwashiorkar, marasmus, xerophthalmia, nutritional anemia and endemic goitre. Iron deficiency anemia is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency affecting all age groups in India. The effects are direct and indirect. Direct effects are occurence of frank and subclinical nutrition deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkar, marasmus, vitamin and mineral deficiency. Indirect effects are a high morbidity and moality among young children retarded physical and mental growth. Malnutrition predisposes to infection and infection to malnutrition. Waterlow&;s classification of PEM: It defines two groups- 1. Malnutrition with a retarded growth, in which a drop in height/age ratio points to a chronic condition - shoness/stunting. It is an index of duration of malnutrition 2. Malnutrition with a low weight fir a normal height, in ehich the weight for height ratio is indicative of acute condition of rapid weight loss/ wasting .

Of these alpha-tocopherol is biologically the most potent. Vitamin E is widely distributed in foods. By far the richest sources are vegetable oils, cotton-seed, sunflower seed, egg yolk and butter. Foods rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids are also rich in vitamin E. The usual plasma level of vitamin E in adults is between 0.8 and 1.4 mg per 100 ml. While there is no doubt that man requires tocopherol in his diet, there is no clear indication of dietary deficiency. The role of vitamin E at the molecular level is little understood. The current estimate of vitamin E requirement is about 0.8 mg/g of essential fatty acids. This roughly works out to 8-10 mg tocopherol per day depending on the edible oil used. Recently the cytotoxic effect of vitamin E on human lymphocytes in vitro at high concentrations has been repoed. This being so, caution should be exercised against the mega-dose consumption of vitamin E in clinical practice. Ref : Park 25th edition Pgno : 657",

A balanced diet is defined as one which contains a variety of foods in such quantities and propoions that the need for energy, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, fats, carbohydrate and other nutrients is adequately met for maintaining health, vitality and general well-being and also makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand sho duration of leanness. A balanced diet has become an accepted means to safeguard a population from nutritional deficiencies. In constructing balanced diet, the following principles should be borne in mind : (a) First and foremost, the daily requirement of protein should be met. This amounts to 10-15 per cent of the daily energy intake. (b) Next comes the fat requirement, which should be limited to 15-30 per cent of the daily energy intake (c) Carbohydrates rich in natural fibre should constitute the remaining food energy. The dietary pattern varies widely in different pas of the world. It is generally developed around the kinds of food produced (or impoed) depending upon the climatic conditions of the region, economic capacity, religion, customs, taboos, tastes and habits of the people. It takes into account 95-98% of population.

In this system,. the \"normal\" reference child is in the 50th centile of the Boston standards. The cut-off values were set during a study of risk of death based on weight for age at admission to a hospital unit. This classification therefore, has a prognostic value for hospitalized children Between 90 and 110% : normal nutritional status Between 75 and 89% :1st degree, mild malnutrition Between 60 and 74% :2nd degree, moderate malnutrition Under60% :3rd degree, severe malnutrition Weight is widely recorded and the classification is easy to compute. The disadvantages are (a) A cut-off-point of 90 per cent of reference is high (80 per cent being approximately equivalent to -2SD or the 3rd percentile), thus some normal children may be classified as 1st degree malnourished.

The test is based on the fact that raw milk contains an enzyme called phosphatase which is destroyed on heating at a temperature which corresponds closely with the standard time and temperature required for pasteurization. At 60 deg C for 30 minutes phosphatase is completely destroyed. Consequently, the test is used to detect inadequate pasteurization or the addition of raw milk. (2) Standard plate count : The bacteriological quality of pasteurized milk is determined by the standard plate count. Most countries in the West enforce a limit of 30,000 bacterial count per ml of pasteurized milk. (3) Coliform count : Coliform organisms are usually completely destroyed by pasteurization, and therefore, their presence in pasteurized milk is an indication either of improper pasteurization or post-pasteurization contamination. The standard in most countries is that coliforms be absent in 1 ml of milk. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 692",

The technique recommended by the Central food technological Research Institute, Mysore is the hot soaking method.

This is followed by draining of water and steaming the soaked paddy in the same container for 5-10min. The paddy is then dried and later homepounded and milled. During the steaming process, a greater pa of the vitamins and minerals present in the outer aleurone layer of rice grain are driven into inner endosperm. With subsequent milling, the nutrients are not removed. There is also no loss of B group vitamin (niacin)which gets washed away at the end of cooking while draining away excess of water. The heat used in drying hardens the rice grain and makes the grain more resistant to insect invasion and more suitable for storage than raw rice. The starch also gets gelatinised which improves the keeping quality of rice.

Malnutrition in India is mainly attributed to kwashiorkar, marasmus, xerophthalmia, nutritional anemia and endemic goitre. Iron deficiency anemia is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency affecting all age groups in India. The effects are direct and indirect. Direct effects are occurence of frank and subclinical nutrition deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkar, marasmus, vitamin and mineral deficiency. Indirect effects are a high morbidity and moality among young children retarded physical and mental growth. Malnutrition predisposes to infection and infection to malnutrition.

There are several methods of pasteurization. Three are widely used : (1) Holder (Vat) method : In this process, milk is kept at 63-66 deg C for at least 30 minutes, and then quickly cooled to 5 deg C. Vat method is recommended for small and rural communities. In larger cities, it is going out of use. (2) HTST method : Also known as \"High Temperature and Sho Time Method\". Milk is rapidly heated to a temperature of nearly 72 deg C, is held at that temperature for not less than 15 seconds, and is then rapidly cooled to 4 deg C. This is now the most widely used method. Very large quantities of milk per hour can be pasteurized by this method. (3) UHT Method : Also known as \"ultra-high temperature method.\" Milk is rapidly heated usually in 2 stages (the second stage usually being under pressure) to 125 deg C for a few seconds only. It is then rapidly cooled and bottled as quickly as possible. Pasteurization is a preventive measure of public health impoance and corresponds in all respects to the modern principles of supplying safe milk. Pasteurization kills nearly 90 per cent of the bacteria in milk including the more heat-resistant tubercle bacillus and the Q fever organisms. But it will not kill thermoduric bacteria nor the bacterial spores. Therefore, despite pasteurization, with subsequent rise in temperature, the bacteria are bound to multiply. In order to check the growth of microorganisms, pasteurized milk is rapidly cooled to 4 deg C. It should be kept cold until it reaches the consumer. Hygienically produced pasteurized milk has a keeping quality of not more than 8 to 12 hours at 18 degC. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 692",

The test is based on the fact that raw milk contains an enzyme called phosphatase which is destroyed on heating at a temperature which corresponds closely with the standard time and temperature required for pasteurization. At 60 deg C for 30 minutes phosphatase is completely destroyed. Consequently, the test is used to detect inadequate pasteurization or the addition of raw milk. (2) Standard plate count : The bacteriological quality of pasteurized milk is determined by the standard plate count. Most countries in the West enforce a limit of 30,000 bacterial count per ml of pasteurized milk. (3) Coliform count : Coliform organisms are usually completely destroyed by pasteurization, and therefore, their presence in pasteurized milk is an indication either of improper pasteurization or post-pasteurization contamination.

Malnutrition in India is mainly attributed to kwashiorkar, marasmus, xerophthalmia, nutritional anemia and endemic goitre. Iron deficiency anemia is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency affecting all age groups in India. The effects are direct and indirect. Direct effects are occurence of frank and subclinical nutrition deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkar, marasmus, vitamin and mineral deficiency. Indirect effects are a high morbidity and moality among young children retarded physical and mental growth. Malnutrition predisposes to infection and infection to malnutrition.

A balanced diet has become an accepted means to safeguard a population from nutritional deficiencies. In constructing balanced diet, the following principles should be borne in mind : (a) First and foremost, the daily requirement of protein should be met. This amounts to 10-15 per cent of the daily energy intake. (b) Next comes the fat requirement, which should be limited to 15-30 per cent of the daily energy intake (c) Carbohydrates rich in natural fibre should constitute the remaining food energy. The dietary pattern varies widely in different pas of the world. It is generally developed around the kinds of food produced (or impoed) depending upon the climatic conditions of the region, economic capacity, religion, customs, taboos, tastes and habits of the people.

        "exp": "Parboiling Parboiling (paial cooking in steam) is ancient Indian technique of preserving the nutritive quality of rice. There are many techniques of parboiling. The technique recommended by the Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore is known as the hot soaking process. The process stas with soaking the paddy (unhusked rice) in hot water at 65 to 70 deg. C for 3 to 4 hours, which swells the grain. This is followed by draining of water and steaming the soaked paddy in the same container for 5 to 10 minutes. The paddy is then dried and later homepounded or milled. During the steaming process, a greater pa of the vitamins and minerals present in the outer aleurone layer of the rice grain are driven into the inner endosperm. With subsequent milling, even to a high degree, the nutrients are not removed. During the drying process, the germ gets attached more firmly to the grain. In addition, the heat used in drying hardens the rice grain. It results in the grain becoming more *resistant to insect invasion and more suitable for storage than raw rice. The starch also gets gelatinized which improves the -keeping quality of rice. The serious disadvantage of parboiling is the development of a peculiar smell or \"off flavour\" which some consumers do not relish. Modern methods of parboiling rice have been developed by which the finished product does not give any bad odour. Ref : Park 25th edition Pgno : 665",

Iodized salns most economical, convenient and effective means of mass prophylaxis inendemic areas. Under the national IDD control activities, the Government of India proposed to completely replace common salt with iodized salt in a phased manner. The National Institute of Nutrition at Hyderabad has come out with a new product, common salt foified with iron and iodine. Community trials have been launched to examine the efficacy of the \"two-in-one\" salt. Iodized oil : Another method which has demonstrated its efficacy for controlling goitre is intramuscular injection of iodized oil (mostly poppy-seed oil). Scientists at the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad have now successfully developed a process to produce iodized oil in safflower or safola oil. The advantage of the injection procedure is that an average dose of 1 ml will provide protection for about 4 years. Although more expensive than iodated salt, this method has the advantage that it can be applied rapidly and in places where iodization of salt is not feasible or iodated salt is in sho supply. However, the difficulty with. this procedure is one of logistics, i.e., in reaching every victim or potential victim of !DD for the injection, which means that this approach is less practicable. . Iodized oil, oral : The oral administration of iodine as iodized oil or as sodium iodate tablets, is technically simpler than the injection method. Limited research has found that these procedures are effective against goitre but more costly than intramuscular injections. Ref : Park 25th edition Pgno : 681",

Khesari dhal (lathyrus sativus), is consumed in pas of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, excessive consumption of which is associated with lathyrism. Pulses contain 20 to 25 per cent of proteins, which is double that found in wheat and three times that found in rice. II') fact, pulses contain more protein than eggs, fish or flesh foods. But in regard to quality, pulse proteins are inferior to animal proteins. Pulse proteins are poor in methionine and to a lesser extent in cysteine. On the other hand they are rich in lysine. Soyabean is exceptionally rich in protein, containing up to 40 per cent. In addition, pulses are rich in minerals and B-group vitamins such as riboflavin and thiamine. In the dry state, pulses do not contain vitamin C. Germinating pulses, however, contain higher concentration of vitamins, especially vitamin C and B vitamins. Fermentation also modifies the nutritive value of pulses .in that the vitamin content paicularly that of riboflavin, thiamine and niacin is enhanced.

        "exp": "<p>ORS Aim of oral rehydration therapy is to prevent dehydration and reduce moality. Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 mOsm/l improved the efficacy of ORS regimen for children with acute non cholera diarrhoea.
