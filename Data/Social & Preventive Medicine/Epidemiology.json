It consists in identifying those who have had RF and giving them one intramuscular injection of benzathine benzyl penicillin (1.2 million units in adults and 600,000 units in children) at intervals of 3 weeks. This must be continued for at least 5 years or until the child reaches 18 years whichever is later. For patients with carditis (mild mitral regurgitation or healed carditis) the treatment should continue for 10 years after the last attack, or at least until 25 years of age, which ever is longer. More severe valvular disease or post-valve surgery cases need life-long Treatment. This prevents streptococcal sore throat and therefore recurrence of RF and RHD. However, the crucial problem is one of patient compliance as penicillin prophylaxis is a long-term affair.

Cross-sectional studieshave been likened to a photograph, and longitudinal studies to a cine film. Longitudinal studies are useful (i) to study the natural history of disease and its future outcome {ii) for identifying risk factors of disease, (iii) for finding out incidence rate or rate of occurrence of new cases of disease in the community. Longitudinal studies provide valuable information which the cross-sectional studies may not provide, but longitudinal studies are difficult to organize and more time-consuming than cross-sectional studies. Measurement can also be extended to health states and events. For example, the study of blood pressure levels in a population will reveal the normal values, rather than abnormal ones related to disease. Ref : Park 23rd edition Pgno : 69",

Infectious agent is dependent on reservoir for survival. From reservoir it can be transmitted to susceptible host. Thus a reservoir may act as a source of infection when a person acquires infection directly from a reservoir.# Source & reservoir are same - Tetanus spores survive in soil (reservoir) and a person acquires infection directly from soil (source). So, soil acts as reservoir as well as source.# Source & reservoir different ->>In typhoid, bacillus survives and multiplies inside human cases or carriers (act as reservoir), but immediate source of infection is feces or urine of patients, or contaminated food, water or milk (act as source).# So, source may or may not be a part of reservoir. In other words reservoir may or may not act as a source.* Reservoir may be: (i) Human, (ii) Animals or bird, or (iii) Non-living things.Human reservoir# Human reservoir is the most important source or reservoir of infection.

Baring a few e.g. measles and chicken pox, sub-clinicalinfection occurs in most cases.# Important examples are rubella, mumps, polio, hepatitis A & B, influenza, diphtheria and Japanese encephalitis.iii) Latent infection# Infectious agent lie dormant in host without any activity, e.g. Herpes simplex, Brill-zinser diseaes, ankylostomiasis.2. Carriers* A carrier is defined as \"an infected person or animal that harbours a specific infectious agent in the absence of clinical disease and serves as a potential source of infection\".* As a rule carriers are less infectious than cases, but epidemiologically they are more dangerous than cases because they escape recognition, and continuing as they do to live a normal life among the population or comunity, they readily infect the susceptible individuals over a wider area and longer period of time.* Carrier may be classified as followTemporary carrier* Temporary carriers shed the infectious agent for short period of time.* This category may include -1. Incubatory carriers :Measles, mumps, polio, pertussis (whooping cough), influenza, diphtheria, Hepatitis B.2. Convalescent carriers:Typhoid, cholera, diphtheria, Pertussis (whooping cough), dysentery.3.

Each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance. There is no stratification in similar groups. Thus, each individual has the same probability of being chosen.# Methods of simple random sampling are : -i) Lottery methodii) Random number tableiii) Computer technique.# It is suitable for small homogenous population and is used in clinical trials. It provides the greatest number of possible samples.ii) Systemic random sampling# In order to do systematic random sampling, the individuals in a population are arranged in a certain way (for example, alphabetically).# A random starting point is selected and then every nth (for example 10th or 15th) individual is selected for the sample.# That is, after arranging the individuals in certain pattern (e.g., alpabetically) a starting point is chosen at random, and choices thereafter at regular intervals.iii) Stratified random sampling# When sub-populations vary considerably, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently.# Stratification is the process of grouping members of the population into relative hemogenous subgroups before sampling.# The strata should be mutually exclusive, every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. Then systematic random sampling method is applied within each stratum.# Stratified random sampling is particularly useful where one is interested in analysing the data by a certain characteristic of the population, viz Hindus, Muslims, Christians, age group etc, - as we know these groups are not equally distributed in the population.iv) Cluster sampling# Cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when natural groupings are evident in a statistical population. In this technique, the total population is divided into these groups (or clusters) and a sample of groups is selected.# The characteristic feature is that selected groups act as samples (while in other types of random sampling individuals act as sample).# Cluster sampling is rapid, simple and economic (less expensive).# Sample size may vary according to study.# Cluster sampling is an example two-stage sampling.# There are chances of sampling error.# Cluster sampling is used in India to evaluate immunization coverage. WHO used 30 x 7 technique (total = 210 children) for cluster sampling in which there are 30 clusters, each containing 7 children who are 12-23 months old and are completely immunized for primary immunization (till measles vaccine at 9 month).v) Multistage random sampling# It is done in successive stages; each successive sampling unit is nested in the previous sampling unit. Advantage: Introduces flexibility in sampling.# For example, in large country surveys, states are chosen, then districts, then villages, then every 10th person in village as final sampling unit.vi) Multiphse random sampling# It is done in successive phase; part of information is obtained from whole sample and part from the sub-sample.# For example, in a TB survey, Mantourx test done in first phase, then X-ray done in all Mantoux positive, then sputum examined in all those with positive X-ray findings.",

For example, improvements in treatment may decrease the duration of illness and thereby decrease prevalence of a disease. But if the treatment is such that by preventing death, and at the same time not producing recovery, may give rise to the apparently paradoxical effect of an increase in prevalence.

Short term fluctuation2. Periodic fluctuation3. Long term or secular trendsShort term fluctuations-best known example is an epidemic. Types of epidemicsI. Common - source epidemics a) Single exposure or \"point source\" epidemics b) Continuous or multiple exposure epidemicsII. Propagated epidemics a) Person -to-person b) Arthropod vector c) Animal reservoirIII. Slow or modem epidemicI. Common - source epidemics1. Single exposure or point source epidemics - the exposure to the disease agent is brief and simultaneous, the resultant cases all develop within one incubation period of the disease. The main features of a point source epidemic are:(i) The epidemic curve rises and falls rapidly, with no secondary waves.(ii) The epidemic tends to be explosive, there is clustering of cases within a narrow interval of time(iii) All cases develop within one incubation period of the disease. Examples - Bhopal gas tragedy in India. Mina Mata disease in Japan, food poisoning.2. Common - source, continuous or repeated exposure epidemics. Exposure from the same source may be prolonged, or repeated. The resulting epidemics tend to be more extensive and irregular. Diseases tend to occur beyond the range of one incubation period. No evidence of secondary cases among persons who had contact with ill persons. E.g, A prostitute being a common source in gonorrhea outbreak.II. Propagated Epidemics- the epidemic usually shows a gradual rise and tails off over a much longer period of time. Transmission continues until the number of susceptible is depleted, e.g., polio, hepatitis A.Periodic fluctuations(a) Seasonal trend - upper respiratory tract infections in winter, gastro intestinal infections in summer.(b) Cyclic trend - diseases may occur in cycles spread over a short period of time.E.g, measles in pre vaccination era appeared every 2-3 years, rubella every 6-9 years, Influenza pandemic every 7-10 years.Long term or secular trends - changes in occurrence of disease over a long period of time, over years or decades. e.g, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, Diabetes.Endemic - it refers to the constant presence of a disease or an infectious agent within a given population group or geographic area without importation from outside.",

Dr. Snow believed sewage dumped into the river or into cesspools near town wells could contaminate the water supply, leading to a rapid spread of disease. In August of 1854 Soho, a suburb of London, was hit hard by a terrible outbreak of cholera. Dr. Snows himself lived near Soho, and immediately went to work to prove his theory that contaminated water was the cause of the outbreak. \"Within 250 yards of the spot where Cambridge Street joins Broad Street there were upwards of 500 fatal attacks of cholera in 10 days,\" Dr. Snow wrote \"As soon as I became acquainted with the situation and extent of this irruption (sic) of cholera, I suspected some contamination of the water of the much-frequented street-pump in Broad Street.\" Dr. Snow worked around the clock to track down information from hospital and public records on when the outbreak began and whether the victims drank water from the Broad Street pump. Snow suspected that those who lived or worked near the pump were the most likely to use the pump and thus, contract cholera. His pioneering medical research paid off. By using a geographical grid to cha deaths from the outbreak and investigating each case to determine access to the pump water, Snow developed what he considered positive proof the pump was the source of the epidemic.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e. Proportion [Ref. style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif\">Prevalence: It refers to all current cases existing at a given point in time.It's not a ratio (numerator is not part of denominator as in ratio).Prevalence is normally expressed as percentage e.g. 5% or number of cases per 10,000 or 100,000When referenced as number of cases per X, it's a proportion.Long Reference: What is Prevalence?\"Prevalence\" is the proportion of a population who have (or had) a specific characteristic in a given time period - in medicine, typically an illness, a condition, or a risk factor such as depression or smoking.Prevalence is calculated if one has information on the characteristics of the entire population of interest (this is rare in medicine).Prevalence is estimated if one has information on samples of the population of interest.Prevalence is generally determined by:Randomly selecting a sample (smaller group) from the entire population, with the goal being for the sample to be representative of the population.For a simple representative sample, prevalence is the number of people in the sample with the characteristic of interest, divided by the total number of people in the sample.When samples (instead of entire populations) are used to generate estimates of prevalence, statistical 'weights' may be applied to adjust the sample characteristics to match up with the target population that they were selected to represent.For example, if the randomly selected sample ends up having 53% women and 47% men in it, but the target population the sample is supposed to represent has 51% women and 49% men, then statistical weights will be applied to bring the proportions of women and men in the sample in alignment with the portions of women and men in the target population.How is Prevalence Reported?Prevalence is usually expressed as a percentage (5%, or 5 people out of 100), or as the number of cases per 10,000 or 100,000 people, depending on how common the illness or risk factor is in the population.There are several ways to measure and report prevalence, which vary according to the timeframe for the estimate:Point prevalence is the proportion of a population that has the characteristic at a specific point in time.Period prevalence is the proportion of a population that has the characteristic at any point during a given time period of interest. \"Past 12 months\" is a commonly used timeframe.Lifetime prevalence is the proportion of a population who, at some point in life up to the time of assessment, has ever had the characteristic.How is Prevalence Different from Incidence?\"Incidence\" is a measure of the number of new cases of a characteristic (such as illness or risk factor) that arise in a population over a given period (e.g., a month, a year, etc.); whereas prevalence is the proportion of a population who have (or had) a specific characteristic in a given time period, regardless of when they first acquired the characteristic.In medicine and public health, one often studies incident (new) cases to help identify causes and prevent additional cases, particularly for infectious/communicable illness.What Else Do I Need to Know about Prevalence?A variety of surveys and data systems are used to produce prevalence estimates of mental disorders. Integrating information from multiple data sources can provide useful information about the mental health of the population of interest.When examining prevalence estimates generated in a variety of surveys, it is important to take into consideration survey methodology differences that may impact the prevalence estimates produced.That is, the goals and approaches for various sources of mental health data are often different, making direct comparisons between them difficult.Some methodological differences that may affect comparisons between studies include, but are not limited to: the populations covered; the timing of data collection; sample design; mode of data collection; instruments and surveys used; operational definitions; and, estimation methods.",

Quarantine measures are also \"applied by a health authority to a ship, an aircraft, a train, road vehicle, other means of transpo or container, to prevent the spread of disease, reservoirs of disease or vectors of disease\" . Quarantine may comprise (a) absolute quarantine, as defined above; (b) modified quarantine, e.g., a selective paial limitation of freedom of movement, such as exclusionof children from school; (c) segregation which has been defined as \"the separation for special consideration, control of observation of some pa of a group of persons (or domestic animals) from the others to facilitate control 'of a communicable disease, e.g., removal of susceptible children to homes of immune persons\". In contrast to isolation, quarantine applies to restrictions on the healthy contacts of an infectious disease. Quarantine which was once a popular method of disease control has now declined in popularity.

In England, it is the basis for the allocation of government money to the health regions of the country. The concept is That the regions with higher moality also have the higher morbidity, and should therefore receive propoionately higher funding to combat ill-health. Standard moality ratio is a ratio (usually expressed as a percentage) of the total number of deaths that occur in the study group to the number of deaths that would have been expected to occur if that study group had experienced the death rates of a standard population (or other reference population). In other words. SMR compares the moality in a study group (e.g., an occupational group) with the moality that the occupational group would have had if they had experienced national moality rates. In this method, the more stable rates of the larger population are applied to the smaller study group. It gives a measure of the likely excess risk of moality due to the occupation. SMR= Observed deaths /Expected deaths X lOO The SMR has the advantage over the direct method of age adjustment in that it permits adjustment for age and other factors where age-specific rates are not available or are unstable because of small numbers. One needs to know only the number of persons in each age group in the study population and the age-specific rates of the national population (or other reference population).

These organisms have been passed repeatedly in the laboratory in tissue culture or chick embryos and have lost their capacity to induce full blown disease but retain their immunogenicity.In general, live vaccines are more potent immunizing agents than killed vaccines, reasons being:(i) live organisms multiply in the host and the resulting antigenic dose is larger than what is injected,(ii) live vaccines have all the major and minor antigenic components,(iii) live vaccines engage certain tissues of the body, as for example, intestinal mucosa by the oral polio vaccine# When two live vaccines are required they should be given either simultaneously at different sites or with an interval of at least 3 weeks.# In the case of live vaccines, immunization is generally achieved with a single dose.# The exception is polio vaccine which needs three or more doses to be given at spaced intervals to produce effective immunity.# Live vaccines usually produce a durable immunity, but not always as long as that of the natural infection.# Live vaccines must be properly stored to retain effectiveness.# Serious failures of measles and polio immunization have resulted from inadequate refrigeration prior to use.",

Long term or secular trendsShort term fluctuations-Best known example is an epidemic.Types of epidemics:A. Common -source epidemicsa) Single exposure or point source epidemicsb) Continuous or multiple exposure epidemicsB. Propagated epidemicsa) Person-to-personb) Arthropod vectorc) Animal reservoirC. Slow or modem epidemicCommon-source epidemics:1. S ingle exposure or point source epidemics-The exposure to the disease agent is brief and simultaneous, the resultant cases all develop within one incubation period of the disease. The main features of a point source epidemic are:i. The epidemic curve rises and falls rapidly, with no secondary wavesii. The epidemic tends to be explosive, there is clustering of cases within a narrow interval of timeiii. All cases develop within one incubation period of the disease.Examples -Bhopal gas tragedy in India, Mina Mata disease in Japan, food poisoning2. Common -source, continuous or repeated exposure epidemicsExposure from the same source may be prolonged, or repeated. The resulting epidemics tend to be more extensive and irregular. Diseases tend to occur beyond the range of one incubation period. No evidence of secondary cases among persons who had contact with ill persons. E.g. A prostitute being a common source in gonorrhea outbreak.Propagated Epidemics:The epidemic usually shows a gradual rise and tails off over a much longer period of time. Transmission continues until the number of susceptible is depleted. E.g., polio, hepatitis APeriodic fluctuations:a) Seasonal trend-upper respiratory tract infections in winter, gastrointestinal infections in summer.b) Cyclic trend-diseases may occur in cycles spread over a short period of time. E.g., Measles in pre vaccination era appeared every 2-3 years, rubella every 6-9 years, Influenza pandemic every 7-10 years.Long term or secular trends - Changes in occurrence of disease over a long period of time, over years or decades.e.g., coronary artery disease, lung cancer, diabetes.Endemic - it refers to the constant presence of a disease or an infectious agent within a given population group or geographic area without importation from outside.",

These distorting factors are called confounding factors or variables. In the study given, protective factor is being studied.

Thus this is an example of confounding factor. Causal association: There are 2 types- 1. One to one causal relationship - Two variables are causally related if a change in one variable is followed by a change in the other. So when the disease is present, the factor must also be present.

Emergencies caused by epidemics remain one of the most impoant challenges to national health administrations. Epidemiology has an impoant role to play in the investigation of epidemics. The objectives of an epidemic investigation are a. to define the magnitude of the epidemic outbreak or involvement in terms of time, place and person. b. to determine the paicular conditions and factors responsible for the occurrence of the epidemic. c. to identify the cause, source(s) of infection, and modes of transmission to determine measures necessary to control the epidemic; and d. to make recommendations to prevent recurrence.
