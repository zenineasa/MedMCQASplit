Fever is exceedingly variable, but commonly lasts for about 5 days. The fever is followed by a remission and a recurrence after 5 days. These recurrences may be single or multiple and upto 12 recurrences every 5-6 days are not uncommon. o Other symptoms and signs include headache, back and limb pain, profuse sweating, shivering, myalgia, arthralgia, splenomegaly, a maculopapular rash in occasional cases, and nuchal rigidity in some cases.Diagnosiso Definitive diagnosis requires isolation of B. quintana by blood cultureo Weil-Felix test used for diagnosis of ricketssial infection is negative in trench fever.Treatmento It is treated with gentamycin along with doxycycline.",
