The woman is required to inse test sticks dipped in her urine The device then calculates the likely date of ovulation well in advance and allows for sperm survival. She is thus shown green light days when conception is unlikely and 'red light' days when conception may well occur o With perfect use failure rates are in the region of 6/100 woman years. o However more typical user failure rates are much higher. Persna has advantage for couples who wish to use natural family planning in that it takes away much of the subjectvity of the symptothermal method and its greater predictive accuracy results in fewer abstinence days (8 on average, compared to 12) however the best use failure rate is still high compared to other methods and it should therefore, be viewed as most suitable for couples spacing rather then preventing a pregnancy.",

Time distribution o There are three kinds of time trends or fluctuations in disease occurence :? A. Sho term fluctuations epidemics B. Secular trends or long term fluctuations C. Periodic fluctuation Sho term fluctuation o The best known sho - term fluctuation in the occurence of a disease is an epidemic. o There are three major types of epidemics ? 1) Common - source epidemics a) Single exposure or point source epidemics b) Continuous or multiple exposure epidemics 2) Propagated epidemics 3) Slow (modern) epidemics Common source epidemics q As name suggests, the source of disease agent is common for all cases. q It is of two types. a) Single exposure or point source epidemics o The exposure to the disease agent is brief and essentially simultaneous --> single exposure. Because disease agent enters into all exposed persons at same time --> the resultant cases all develop within one incubation period of the disease. The epidemic curve rises and falls rapidly. Because exposure is single (simultaneous) with no fuher exposure ---> No secondary wave (no secondary case). Epidemic tends to be explosive, there is clustering of cases within a narrow interval of time. o Point source epidemics are mostly (not always) due to exposure to an infectious agent. Examples --> Food poisoning, Bhopal gas tragedy, Minamata disease in Japan, Chernobyl tragedy. b) Continous or multiple exposure epidemics o Exposure from the common (same) source is prolonged - continous, repeated or intermittent. o Exposure is not at the same time or place. o For examle, a prostitute may be a common source in a gonorrhea outbreak, but since she will infect her clients over a period of time there may be no explosive rise in number of case. Because disease agent enters into exposed person at different time --> outbreaks continues over more than one incubation period. o Example --> Outbreak of legionnaire's disease (respiratory illness) in 1976 in Philadelphia (USA).",

Live attenuated mumps vaccine strains used only on a limited scale include the Hoshino, Torii and NKM-46 strains. The WHO recommends that the Rubini mumps vaccine strain should not be used in national immunization programmes because of its demonstrated low effectiveness. A single dose (0-5 ml) intramuscularly produces detectable antibodies in 95% of vaccines. The duration of long-term immunity is not known. It is recommended for routine immunization for children over 1 year of age, either alone or in combination with other virus vaccines, e.g. in MMR vaccine or as a quadrivalent vaccine with varicella. A second dose is recommended for children at 4-6 years of age i.e., before staing the school.

        "exp": "Ans. C: Hypochlorous acid During chlorination of water, hypochlorous acid (HOC1) has main role in disinfection Chlorination of water When chlorine is added to water, it reacts to form a pH dependent equilibrium mixture of chlorine, hypochlorous acid and hydrochloric acid: C12 + H20 HOC1 + HC1 Depending on the pH, hypochlorous acid paly dissociates to hydrogen and hypochlorite ions: HOC1 H+ + C10- In acidic solution, the major species are C12 and HOC1 while in alkaline solution effectively only C10- is present. Very small concentrations of C102-, 0103-, C104- are also found Disinfection by chlorination can be problematic, in some circumstances. Chlorine can react with naturally occurring organic compounds found in the water supply to produce compounds known as disinfection byproducts (DBPs). The most common DBPs are trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAS). Due to the potential carcinogenicity of these compounds, drinking water regulations across the developed world require regular monitoring of the concentration of these compounds in the distribution systems of municipal water systems. There are also other concerns regarding chlorine, including its volatile nature which causes it to disappear too quickly from the water system, and aesthetic concerns such as taste and odour.",

        "question": "Which of the following is not included in phase I clinical trial of medicine: March 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Epilepsy patients Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into four phases. Each phase of the drug approval process is treated as a separate clinical trial. The drug-development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years. If the drug successfully passes through Phases I, II, and III, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Phase IV are 'post-approval' studies. Before pharmaceutical companies sta clinical trials on a drug, they conduct extensive pre-clinical studies. Pre-clinical studies involve in vitro (i.e., test tube or laboratory) studies and trials on animal populations (in vivo) in order to obtain preliminary efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetic information and to assist pharmaceutical companies in deciding whether it is wohwhile to go ahead with fuher testing. Phase 0 trials are also known as human microdosing studies. Distinctive features of Phase 0 trials include the administration of single subtherapeutic doses of the study drug to a small number of subjects (10 to 15) to gather preliminary data on the agent's pharmacokinetics (how the body processes the drug) and pharmacodynamics (how the drug works in the body). A Phase 0 study gives no data on safety or efficacy, being by definition a dose too low to cause any therapeutic effect. Phase I trials are the first stage of testing in human subjects. Normally, a small (20-80) group of healthy volunteers will be selected. This phase includes trials designed to assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug. These trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. Phase I trials also normally include dose-ranging, also called dose escalation, studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. Phase I trials most often include healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances when real patients are used, such as patients who have end-stage disease and lack other treatment options. This exception to the rule most often occurs in oncology (cancer) and HIV drug trials. Once the initial safety of the study drug has been confirmed in Phase I trials, Phase II trials are performed on larger groups (20-300) and are designed to assess how well the drug works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers and patients. Phase IIA is specifically designed to assess dosing requirements (how much drug should be given). Phase IIB is specifically designed to study efficacy (how well the drug works at the prescribed dose(s). Phase III studies are randomized controlled multicenter trials on large patient groups (300-3,000 or more depending upon the disease/medical condition studied) and are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the drug is, in comparison with current 'gold standard' treatment. Because of their size and comparatively long duration, Phase III trials are the most expensive, time-consuming and difficult trials to design and run, especially in therapies for chronic medical conditions. Phase IV trial is also known as Post Marketing Surveillance Trial. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance) and ongoing technical suppo of a drug after it receives permission to be sold. Phase IV studies may be required by regulatory authorities or may be undeaken by the sponsoring company for competitive or other reasons.",

Such concerted preventive actions should reduce not only cardiovascular diseases but also other major NCDs.\"\nPrevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)\u00a0:\n1. Population strategy :\n\nFocus on control of underlying causes (risk factors) in whole populations, 'not merely by individuals'\nPrinciple: Small changes in risk factor levels in total populations can achieve the biggest reduction in mortality, thus aim should be 'to shift the whole curve or risk factors towards biological normality'\nSpecific interventions:\n1. Dietary changes: Dietary modification is the principal preventive strategy in the prevention of CHD;\n\nWHO recommended changes (Prudent diet-dietary goals):\ni. Reduction of fat intake to < 20 \u2014 30 % of total energy intake\nii. Consumption of saturated fats < 10 % of total energy intake\niii. Reduction in dietary cholesterol to < 100 mg/1000 kcal/day\niv Increase in complex carbohydrate consumption\nv. Reduction of salt intake to \u2264 5 gms per day\nvi.

The term AFP means paralysis of acute onset involving limbs leading to flaccidity. Poliomylelitis is most impoant etiology of AFP, other causes are - GBS (Guillain-Barre syndrome), transverse myelitis and traumatic neuritis. AFP surveillance aims at detecting cases of AFP and repoing them immediately to district immunization officer. Surveillance is carried out for all cases of AFP and not just for poliomyelitis. All cases of AFP are repoed, regardless of the final diagnosis. As paralytic poliomyelitis is one cause of AFP, maintaining a high sensitivity of AFP repoing will ensure that all cases of paralytic poliomyelitis are detected, repoed and investigated, resulting in preventive central measures to interrupt the transmission of disease. The aim of AFP surveillance is to detect polio virus transmission, and the earlier the stool is collected, the greater the chance of detecting polio virus. WHO recommends the immediate repoing and investigation of every case of AFP in children less than 15 yrs (As AFP in a person > 15 yrs is unlikely to be polio. Still, AFP surveillance must be flexible enough to repo any case of AFP in an adult, if suspected to be due to poliomyelitis) Cases ofAFP are classified as Polio if : Wild polio virus is isolated from any stool specimen. Cases of AFP without isolation of wild polio virus may be classified as 'polio compatible' if : Stool specimens were inadequate and Residual weakness was present 60 days after onset of paralysis or 60-day follow-up was not done (due to death or absence) and 'Expe review' concludes that these cases could not be discarded as 'non-polio' based on available data.",

Lead time o The lead time is the time period between diagnosis by early detection (i.e., earliest point of diagnosis by screening test) and diagnosis by standard diagnostic tests. o Lead time is the advantage gained by screening. Implications of lead time & Screening time o If the person is diagnosed in screening time (from first possible point to final critical point), the outcome can be improved/changed by early treatment. o If the person is diagnosed after screening time (after final critical point), the outcome will not change even with treatment. o So, though the lead time is the advantage gained by screening, only the earlier poion of lead time, i.e., screening time is impoant for screening tests. o For example if the usual outcome of a disease is death (without any intervention). Following may occur : - i) Person is diagnosed before final critical point in screening time ---> Person may survive or death may be postponed by treatment (outcome is altered/improved). ii) Person is diagnosed after final critical point, even if in lead time (i.e., poion of lead time after screening time) ----> Person will die even with treatment, at the same time (the time of death without any intervention). iii) Screening is not useful for the diseases, which do not have lead time (screening time is a poion of lead time) --> Because there is nothing to be gained by screening as the disease will be diagnosed at the usual time of diagnosis (as by standard diagnostic tests).",

        "question": "The number of girls a woman would bear if she passes through her reproductive age with the same feility rate gives: March 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Gross reproductive rate The net reproduction rate (NRR) measures the effective feility in a population, taking account not only of bihs but also of the fact that not all women born will survive to their own reproductive years. The NRR is the average number of daughters of reproductive age that a woman would have if she experienced over her lifetime the prevailing age-specific rates of feility and if her daughters experienced the prevailing rates of moality. The gross reproduction rate (GRR) for a paicular year is the average number of daughters that a woman would have if she experienced over her lifetime the age-specific feility rates of that year. In that it refers only to the number of daughters born to women, not the total number of children, it is a special case of the (period) total feility rate; in most circumstances (unless the sex ratio at bih is highly unequal) the GRR equals roughly half the TFR. The general feility rate is similar to the crude bih rate except that it uses a more restricted denominator, the female population of childbearing age, ages 15 to 49. Age-specific feility rates (also called age-specific bih rates) are similar to the crude bih rate but are calculated for specific age groups of women of childbearing age. The range of childbearing ages is conventionally considered to be ages 15 to 49 (sometimes 15 to 44 is used), and a full set of age-specific feility rates would span this interval-usually either in single-year age groups or, more commonly, in five-year groups: 15 to 19, 20 to 24, ..., 45 to 49. Marital feility rates can be calculated either for the full range of reproductive ages (15 to 49 or 15 to 44) or as age-specific rates. The numerator is usually taken as the total number of live-bihs to women in the specified age range, regardless of the marital status of the mother; the denominator is the number of currently married women in the specified age range The total feility rate (TFR) at a given time (technically referred to as the period total feility rate) is the average number of children a woman would bear in her life if she experienced the age-specific feility rates prevailing at that time.",

Mechanism of action When chlorine is added to water, there is formation of hypochloric and hypochlorous acid The hypochloric acid is neutralized by the alkanity of the water. The hypochlorous acid ionizes to form hydrogen ions and hypochlorite ions. The disinfecting action of chlorine is mainly due to the hypochlorous acid and to a small extent due to the hypochlorite ions. The hypochlorous acid is the most effective form of chlorine for water disinfection, it is 70-80 times more effective than hypochlorite ion.

The validity of the ceificate begins 10 days after the date of vaccination and extends up to 10 years. Revaccination performed before the end of the validity of ceicicate renders the ceificate valid for a fuher period of 10 years staing on the day of revaccination. If no such ceificate fo vaccination is available, the travellar is placed on quarantine for 6 days from the date of leaving an infected area. ii) Mosquitoes The aircraft and ships arriving from endemic areas are subjected to aerosol spraying with prescribed insecticides.

        "question": "Vector for Yellow fever is: September 2011, March 2013",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Aedes Aedes aegypti is the main vector for yellow fever across world Yellow fever/ \"Yellow Jack\" It is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease. The virus is a 40 to 50 nm enveloped RNA virus with positive sense of the Flaviviridae family. The yellow fever virus is transmitted by the bite of female mosquitoes (the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, and other species) and is found in tropical and subtropical areas in South America and Africa, but not in Asia. The only known hosts of the virus are primates and several species of mosquito. In the 19th century, yellow fever was deemed one of the most dangerous infectious diseases. Yellow fever presents in most cases with fever, nausea, and pain and it generally subsides after several days. In some patients, a toxic phase follows, in which liver damage with jaundice (giving the name of the disease) can occur and lead to death. Because of the increased bleeding tendency (bleeding diathesis), yellow fever belongs to the group of hemorrhagic fevers. A safe and effective vaccine against yellow fever has existed since the middle of the 20th century and some countries require vaccinations for travelers. Since no therapy is known, vaccination programs are, along with measures to reduce the population of the transmitting mosquito, of great impoance in affected areas. Since the 1980s, the number of cases of yellow fever has been increasing, making it a reemerging disease Yellow fever is caused by the yellow fever virus, a 40 to 50 nm wide enveloped RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae. The viruses infect amongst others monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. After entering the host cells, the viral genome is replicated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in the so-called vesicle packets. After transmission of the virus from a mosquito the viruses replicate in the lymph nodes and infect dendritic cells in paicular. From there they reach the liver and infect hepatocytes (probably indirectly Kupffer cells), which leads to eosinophilic degradation of these cells and to the release of cytokines. Necrotic masses (Councilman bodies) appear in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. If yellow fever is suspected, the virus cannot be confirmed until six to ten days after the illness. A direct confirmation can be obtained by Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction where the genome of the virus is amplified. Another direct approach is the isolation of the virus and its growth in cell culture using blood plasma; this can take one to four weeks. Serologically an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay during the acute phase of the disease using specific IgM against yellow fever or an increase in specific IgG-titer (compared to an earlier sample) can confirm yellow fever. Together with clinical symptoms, the detection of IgM or a fourfold increase in IgG-titer is considered sufficient indication for yellow fever. Since these tests can cross-react with other Flaviviruses, like Dengue virus, these indirect methods can never prove yellow fever infection. In a differential diagnosis, infections with yellow fever have to be distinguished from other feverish illnesses like malaria. Other viral hemorrhagic fever, such as Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Marburg virus or Junin virus have to be excluded as cause. For journeys into affected areas, vaccination is highly recommended since mostly non-native people are affected by severe cases of yellow fever. The protective effect is established 10 days after vaccination in 95% of the vaccinated people and lasts for at least 10 years (even 30 years later, 81% of patients retained the immunity). The attenuated live vaccine (stem 17D) was developed in 1937 by Max Theiler from a diseased patient in Ghana and is produced in chicken eggs. WHO recommends routine vaccinations for people living in endemic areas between the 9th and 12th month after bih.",

The WHO guideline for nitrates in drinking water is established to prevent methaemoglobinaemia (blue babies), which is lethal in babies. It can be potentially hazardous with health risks for considerable groups of people and depends on the conversion of nitrates to nitrites and wells which were shallow, dug of located on large farms, or springs were more likely to have elevated concentrations of nitrates.

Some definitions of tuberculosis cases and treatment Case of tuberculosis : A patient in whom tuberculosis has been confirmed by bacteriology or diagnosed by a clinician. Sputum smear examination - Laboratory technique to screen sputum for tuberculosis, where acid fast bacilli (AFB) are stained red by the Ziehl Neelsen method, and then identified and counted using microscopy. Smear positive tuberculosis - At least one initial sputum smears positive for AFB or one AFB positive. Smear negative tuberculosis - At least two negative smears, but tuberculosis suggestive symptoms and X-ray abnormalities or positive culture. Adherence - Person takes appropriate drug regimen for required time (also known as compliance). New case - A patient with sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis who has never had treatment for tuberculosis or has taken anti - tuberculosis drugs for less than 4 weeks. Relapse - A patient who returns smear positive having previously been treated for tuberculosis and declared cured after the completion of his treatment. Failure case - A patient who was initially smear positive, who began treatment and who remained or became smear positive again at five months or later during the course of treatment. Return after default - A patient who returns sputum smear positive, after having left treatment for at least two months. Transfer in - A patient recorded in another administrative area register and transferred into another area to continue treatment (treatment results should be repoed to the district where the patient was initially registered). Transfer out - A patient who has been transferred to another area register and treatment results are not known. Cured - Initially smear positive patient who completed treatment and had negative smear result on at least two occasions (one at treatment completion). Treatment completed - Initially smear negative patient who received full course of treatment, or smear positive who completed treatment, with negative smear at the end of initial phase, but no or only one negative smear during continuation and none at treatment end. Coho - A group of patients in whom TB has been diagnosed, and who were registered for treatment during a specified time period (e.g. the coho of new smear-positive cases registered in the calender year 2003). This group forms the denominator for calculating treatment outcomes. The sum of the treatment outcomes, plus any case for which no outcome is recorded (eg. still on treatment) should equal the number of cases registered.

Cyclopropagative - The agent changes in form & multiplies in the body of ahropod e.g. malarial parasites in mosquito c.
