Smoke concentration is estimated and expressed as micrograms/cubic metre of air as an average level over a period of time.* Sulphur dioxide This gas is a major contaminant in many urban and industrial areas. Its concentration is estimated in all air pollution surveys. So, it is the best indicator of air pollution* Grit and dust measurement: Deposit gauges collect grit, dust and other solids.
