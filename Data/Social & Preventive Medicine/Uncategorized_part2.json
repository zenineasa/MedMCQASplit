Antigenic drift involves point mutation in the gene owing to selection pressure by immunity in the host population Antigenic drift accounts for the periodic epidemics of influenza. Occurs every 2-3 years in case of Influenza A and every 4-7 years in case of Influenza-B 2) Antigenic shift An abrupt, drastic, discontinuous variation in the antigenic structure.

A: Filarial parasite Cyclodevelopmental biological transmission is shown by filarial parasite in culex mosquito and guineaworm embryo in Cyclops (when the disease agent undergoes cyclical changes but do not multiply in the body of the ahropod) Propagative transmission In the case of viruses, rickettsiae, bacteria and parasites, the parasites reproduce (i.e. propagate) in the vector, but do not pass through developmental stages. Transmission cannot occur until the parasite population has increased many fold and been disseminated, e.g. to the salivary glands. Cyclopropagative transmission In this case, protozoan parasites undergo both development and reproduction within the vector. These parasites both increase in number and transform to a different life stage before transmission can occurs. However, the veebrate stages of these parasites can invoke a new infection if they are directly transferred to another veebrate host blood transfusion or across the placenta (e.g. malaria parasites) or through sexual intercourse. (e.g. trypanosomes). Cyclodevelopmental transmission Microfilarial parasites ingested by the vector with the blood meal undergo development to 3rd stage larvae (L3) before being transferred back to another veebrate host. There is no replication and not all ingested microfilaria survive to L3. Thus, the number of parasites leaving the vector is always less than the number entering.",

B: Every pregnant women is provided cash assistance In High performing states, eligibility of cash assistance is for pregnant women below povey line, aged 19 years and above and SC and ST women only. In Low performing states, every women delivering in government health center or accredited private institutions are given financial assistance. Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) It is a safe motherhood intervention under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) being implemented with the objective of reducing maternal and neo-natal moality by promoting institutional delivery among the poor pregnant women. The Yojana, launched on 12th April 2005, by the Hon'ble Prime Minister, is being implemented in all states and UTs with special focus on low performing states. JSY is a 100% centrally sponsored scheme and it integrates cash assistance with delivery and post-delivery care. The success of the scheme would be determined by the increase in institutional delivery among the poor families The Yojana has identified ASHA, the accredited social health activist as an effective link between the Government and the poor pregnant women in 10 low performing states, namely Uttar Pradesh, Uttarachal, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh, Orissa, Assam and JandK and the remaining NE States. In other eligible states and UTs, wherever, AWW/ anganwadi worker and TBAs/ trained bih attendants or ASHA like activist has been engaged in this purpose, she can be associated with this Yojana for providing the services. Role of ASHA or other link health worker associated with JSY would be to: - Identify pregnant woman as a beneficiary of the scheme and repo or facilitate registration for ANC, - Assist the pregnant woman to obtain necessary ceifications wherever necessary - Provide and/or help the women in receiving at least three ANC checkups including TT injections, IFA tablets, - Identify a functional Government health center or an accredited private health institution for referral and delivery, - Counsel for institutional delivery, - Esco the beneficiary women to the pre-determined health center and stay with her till the woman is discharged, - Arrange to immunize the newborn till the age of 14 weeks, - Inform about the bih or death of the child or mother to the ANM/ MO, - Post natal visit within 7 days of delivery to track mother's health after delivery and facilitate in obtaining care, wherever necessary, - Counsel for initiation of breastfeeding to the newborn within one-hour of delivery and its continuance till 3-6 months and promote family planning. Impoant Features of JSY: The scheme focuses on the poor pregnant woman with special dispensation for states having low institutional delivery rates namely the states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Rajasthan, Orissa and Jammu and Kashmir. While these states have been named as Low Performing States (LPS), the remaining states have been named as High performing States (HPS). Tracking Each Pregnancy: Each beneficiary registered under this Yojana should have a JSY card along with a MCH card. ASHA/ AWW/any other identified link worker under the overall supervision of the ANM and the MO, PHC should mandatorily prepare a micro-bih plan. Please see.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Indirect association Association Descriptive studies help to suggest an aetiological hypothesis. Analytic and experimental studies test the hypothesis, derived from descriptive studies and confirm or refute the observed association between suspected causes and disease. Association may be defined as the concurrence of two variables more often than would be expected by chance. In other words, events are said to be associated when they occur more frequently togeher than one would expect by chance. Association can be of following types : - 1 .Spurious association Observed association between a disease and suspected factor is spurious, i.e., not real. In other words there is an observed association when none actually exists. 2.Indirect association The indirect association is a statistical association between a variable of interest and a disease due to the presence of another factor, known or unknown, that is common to both the variable and the disease. This third factor (i.e., the common factor) is also known as the confounding variable. For example, endemic goitre (disease) is found at high altitudes (variable), showing thereby an association between altitude and endemic goitre. But it is due to iodine deficiency which is common at high altitude. So, iodine deficiency acts as a confounding factor as it is associated with both high altitude and endemic goitre. 3.Direct (causal) association a) One to one causal relationship Two variables are stated to be causally related if change in one is followed by change in other. If It does not, then their relationship cannot be causal. b) Multifactorial causation The causal thinking is different in non-communicable disease (e.g., CHD) where the etiology is multifactorial, i.e., more than one factors are associated with disease causation.",

A: None (Its Indices of Urinary excretion of Iodine) Neonatal hypothyroidism is a sensitive pointer to environmental iodine deficiency and is thus an effective indicator for monitoring the impact of the iodine deficiency control programme. Neonatal thyroid screening using serum thyrotropin (TSH) as the primary screening test detects not only permanent sporadic congenital hypothyroidism, whose incidence is about 1 per 4000 bihs, but also compensated or transient primary hypothyroidism, whose incidence can be as high as 1 in 10 neonates and whose main cause is iodine deficiency. Elevated serum TSH in the neonate indicates insufficient supply of thyroid hormones to the developing brain, and therefore, constitutes the only indicator that allows prediction of possible impairment of mental development at a population level, which is the main consequence of iodine deficiency. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD) included neonatal TSH as one of the indicators for assessing iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) and their control.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Low validity and low reliability o Reliability is synonymous with consistency of test, i.e. it should produce consistent results when repeated n number of times. o Validity refers to the degree in which our test or other measuring device is truly measuring what we intended it to measure, i.e. accuracy of the test. The validity often is associated by comparing a measurement method with the best possible method of measure that is available. For example, the validity of BP measurements obtained by a sphygmonanometer might be compared with those obtained by intra-aerial measurements. o A test may have: (1) High Reliability (consistent) and High validity (accurate) The test produces consistent results when repeated several times and values are close to the true values. In above graph and figure the test has produced consistent results whose values are around the true values. For example, a person of 70 kg steps on a scale 10 times gets reading 69, 69, 70, 71, 69, 69, 71, 70. So, the test is showing consistent results (69-71 kg) and the values are very close to the true values. (2) Low reliability and low validity The test produces inconsistent results and values are far from the true values. For example, a person of 200 pounds steps on a scale 10 times and gets reading of 15, 250, 95, 140, 80, 100, 130, 400, 50, 100. So, the tests results are inconsistent and the values are far away from the true value. The test produces consistent results but the values are far away from true value. For example, a person of 200 pounds steps on a scale 10 times and gets reading 150 pounds all ten times. So, the tests resulsts are consistent (150 pounds all ten times) but values are far away from true value. o From above discussion it is clear that reliability does not imply validity. A test may be reliable (consistent) but not valid (accurate). However, unreliable test (inconsistent) test cannot be valid. \"Reliability is necessary but not sufficient for validity\" Coming to the question o Test in question showing different values everytime it is repeated. So, the result is not reliable (inconsistent). o Unreliable test cannot be valid. o So, the test in question has low reliability and low validity.",

International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of WHO, acknowledged dioxins cancer causing potential and classified it as human carcinogen.\nTo avoid dioxin production, no chlorinated plastic bags (and preferably no other chlorinated corn pounds) should be introduced into the incinerator.\n\n\nRed bags must not be incinerated as red colour contains cadmium, which causes toxic emissions.\n\nIf mercury-containing items are put into a red bag for infectious waste and sent to an incinerator or other waste treatment technology, mercury will contaminate the environment.\nAirborne mercury then enters a global distribution cycle in the environment, contaminating fish and wildlife. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cross the blood- brain barrier as well as the placenta.\nPublic concerns about incinerator emissions, as well as the creation of federal regulations for medical waste incinerators, are causing many health care facilities to rethink their choices in medical waste treatment. As stated by Health Care without Harm, an international coalition of 470 organizations in 52 countries, non-incineration treatment technologies are a growing and developing field.\nSome technologies are still essentially prototypes, while others, such as autoclave technology, have been used for decades.",

Now see types of error : ? There are two basic type of statistical errors : ? 1) Type I error 2) Type II error Type I error It is also known as an error of first kind or a-error or false positive. o This type of error rejects null hypothesis when it is true False rejection of null hypothesis. o That means in real there is no difference (as null hypothesis says) but we observe a difference (by rejecting the null hypotesis due to error). In very simple words \"we observe a difference when it is not true\" false positive. o One of the simplest example of this would be if a test shows that a women is pregnant when in reality she is not, i.e., she is false positive for pregnancy. o Probability of type-I error is given by '13-value' (probability of declaring a significant difference when actually it is not present). o Significance (a) level is the maximum tolerable probability of type I error. o Significance (a) level is fixed in advance and calculation of P value (probability of type I error) can be less than, equal to or greater than the significance (a) level. o If the probability of type I error (P -value) is less than significance (a) level, the results are declared statistically significant. Therefore, to declare the results statistical significant, type I error (a-level) should be kept to minimum . o Type I error is more serious that type II error. Type II error It is also known as an error or second kind or error or false negative. o This type of error accept/fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false -->False acceptance of null hypothesis. That means we fail to observe a difference when in truth there is one --4 False negative. o An example of this would be if a test shows that a woman is not pregnant when in reality she is i.e., she is false negative.",

P-value and Type I error Type I error (alpha error) occur when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected erroneously, which leads to an erroneous conclusion that a difference exists between the two samples. If a test has statistic with a p-value of less than 0.05, it is accepted as statistically significant and the null hypothesis is rejected. In this situation, approximately 5% of the time type I error is made because if no difference actually exists between groups, that result will occur by chance in 5% (1 in 20 times). How is it possible ? It has already been explained that p value is 0.5 means that there is 5% chance of null hypothesis being true and 95% chance of being false; and if a study results have p value of S 0.5 the null hypothesis is rejected and the difference between groups is considered as statistically significant. So, there are 5% chances that null hypothesis is true but rejected --> Type I error. So, p-value tells about the probability of type I error (i.e., rejection of null hypothesis when it is true) If, p-value is 5 0.001 a type 1 error will occur 0.1% of the time (1 in 1000 times) Therefore, chance of making a type I error is decreased if you use a lower p value. So, If one rejects the null hypothesis, one risks committing a type 1 error, the probability of which is equal to the p value.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Leishmani Donovani Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of kala-azar (VL) Visceral leishmaniasis/ VL/ kala-azar/ black fever/ Dumdum fever It is the most severe form of leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. This disease is the second-largest parasitic killer in the world (after malaria) The parasite migrates to the internal organs such as liver, spleen (hence 'visceral') and bone marrow Several species of Leishmania are known to give rise to the visceral form of the disease. The \"Old World\" (Africa, Asia, Europe) species are L. donovani and L. infantum and the \"New World\" (South America) species is L. chagasi. Life-cycle of the parasite Visceral leishmaniasis (Kala-azar) is spread through an insect vector, the sandfly of the Phlebotomus genus in the Old World and the Lutzomyia genus in the New World. Sandflies are tiny creatures, 3-6 millimeters long by 1.5-3 millimeters in diameter, and found in tropical or temperate regions throughout the world. Sandfly larvae grow in warm, moist organic matter, such as old trees, house walls or waste -- making them hard to eradicate. The adult female sand fly is a bloodsucker, usually feeding at night on sleeping prey. When the fly bites an animal infected with L. donovani, the pathogen is ingested along with the prey's blood. At this point the protozoan is in the smaller of its two forms, called an amastigote -- round, non-motile, and only three to seven micrometers in diameter. Taken into the stomach of the sandfly, the amastigotes quickly transform into a second L. donovani form, called the promastigote. This form is spindle-shaped, triple the size of the amastigote, and has a single flagellum that allows for motility.The promastigotes live extracellularly in the sandfly's alimentary canal, reproducing asexually, then migrate to the proximal end of the gut where they become poised for a regurgitational transmission. This is their means of transmission back into a mammalian host, as the fly injects its saliva into prey when it bites. The promastigotes are introduced locally at the bite site along with the fly's saliva. Once inside the new host, promastigotes invade macrophages. Once inside, they transform back into the smaller amastigote form. As an amastigote, L. donovani can only reproduce intracellularly -- and the amastigotes replicate in the most hostile pa of the macrophage cell, inside the phagolysosome, whose normal defensive response they are able to prevent. After they have reproduced to a ceain extent, the L. donovani lyse their host cell by sheer pressure of mass, but there is some recent speculation that they are able to leave the cell by triggering the exocytosis response of the macrophage. The daughter cell protozoans then migrate through the bloodstream to find new macrophage hosts. In time, L. donovani becomes a systemic infection, spreading to all the host's organs, paicularly the spleen and liver",

Ninety per cent of the world's production of asbestos is of the serpentine variety, which is hydrated magnesium silicate, the amphibole type contains little magnesium. The amphibole type occurs in different varieties, e.g., crocidolite (blue), amosite (brown), and anthrophyllite (white). Asbestos fibres are usually from 20 to 500 vt in length and 0.5 to 50 p. in diameter. Asbestos is used in the manufacture of asbestos cement, fire-proof textiles, roof tiling, brake lining, gaskets and several other items.

        "question": "Human milk as compared to cow's milk is: March 2011,March 2013 (b)",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Rich in lactose Lactose content of human milk is 7.4g/100 gm whereas that of cows milk is 4.4 g/100 grams Human milk The initial milk produced is often referred to as colostrum, which is high in the immunoglobulin IgA, which coats the gastrointestinal tract. This helps to protect the newborn until its own immune system is functioning properly, and creates a mild laxative effect, expelling meconium and helping to prevent the build up of bilirubin (a contributory factor in jaundice). During the first few days after delivery, the breasts produce colostrum. This is a thin yellowish fluid that is the same fluid that leaks from the breasts during pregnancy. It is rich in protein and antibodies that provide passive immunity to the baby (the baby's immune system is not fully developed at bih). Colostrum also helps the newborn's digestive system to grow and function properly. After 3 to 4 days, breasts will begin producing milk that is thin, watery, and sweet. This quenches the baby's thirst and provides the proteins, sugar, and minerals that the baby needs. Foremilk, the milk released at the beginning of a feed, is watery, low in fat, and high in carbohydrates relative to the creamier hindmilk, which is released as the feed progresses. The breast can never be truly \"emptied,\" since milk production is a continuous biological process. The level of Immunoglobilin A (IgA) in breast milk remains high from day 10 until at least 7.5 months post-paum. Human milk contains 1.1% protein, 3.4% fat, 7.4% carbohydrates, and 0.1% ash (minerals). Carbohydrates are mainly lactose. The fat fraction contains specific triglycerides of palmitic and oleic acid (0-P-0 triglycerides), and also quite a large quantity of lipids with trans bonds. They are vaccenic acid, and Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) accounting for up to 6% of the human milk fat. The principal proteins are casein (homologous to bovine beta-casein), alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, IgA, lysozyme, and serum albumin. In an acidic environment such as the stomach, alpha-lactalbumin unfolds into a different form and binds oleic acid to form a complex called HAMLET. Non-protein nitrogen-containing compounds, making up 25% of the milk's nitrogen, include urea, uric acid, creatine, creatinine, amino acids, and nucleotides. It is now universally recognized that there is no commercial formula that can equal breast milk. In addition to the appropriate amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat, breast milk provides vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, and hormones - all of the things that a growing infant will require. Breast milk also contains antibodies and lymphocytes from the mother that help the baby resist infections. The immune function of breast milk is individualized, as the mother, through her touching and taking care of the baby, comes into contact with pathogens that colonize the baby, and, as a consequence, her body makes the appropriate antibodies and immune cells. This is the reason why breast milk contains very little iron, as iron is an essential precursor to the activation of micro bacteria and gut flora; providing iron in the milk would lead to infection. However, the internal iron supplies of the infant, held in the hepatic cells of the liver, are exhausted at 4-6 months, hence this is the time that complimentary feeding is introduced, as to prevent anemia (recommended by WHO). Whole cow's milk It does not contain sufficient vitamin E, iron, or essential fatty acids, which can make infants fed on cow's milk anemic. Whole cow's milk also contains excessive amounts of protein (3.2 g/ 100 gram), sodium, and potassium, which may put a strain on an infant's immature kidneys. In addition, the proteins and fats in whole cow's milk are more difficult for an infant to digest and absorb than the ones in breast milk. A significant minority of infants are allergic to one or more of the constituents of cow's milk, most often the cow's milk proteins. These problems can also affect infant formulas derived from cow's milk.",

Rather with elimination of vaccination and waning immunity against small pox, an increase in human monkey pox cases may occur. Small pox eradication: Small pox was declared eradicated on 8th May 1980. The epidemiological factors which led to small pox eradication are as follows: Highly effective, heat stable and easily administrable vaccine that confers long-term protection.

The relationship is sufficiently strong for infant moality rates on occasion to have been used as indicators of income levels when the requisite data for computing the latter are missing. Gordon et al. have suggested that the death rate of children in their second year of life may be a better indicator of general health levels than infant morality, which responds to a number of influences not present at other ages.

New case - A patient with sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis who has never had treatment for tuberculosis or has taken anti - tuberculosis drugs for less than 4 weeks. Relapse - A patient who returns smear positive having previously been treated for tuberculosis and declared cured after the completion of his treatment. Failure case - A patient who was initially smear positive, who began treatment and who remained or became mear positive again at five months or later during the course of treatment. Return after default - A patient who returns sputum smear positive, after having left treatment for at least two months. Transfer in - A patient recorded in another administrative area register and transferred into another area to continue treatment (treatment results should be repoed to the district where the patient was initially registered). Transfer out - A patient who has been transferred to another area register and treatment results are not known. Cured - Initially smear positive patient who completed treatment and had negative smear result on at least two occasions (one at treatment completion).

Iodized salt is most economical, convenient and effective means of mass prophylaxis in endemic areas. Recently the National institure of Nutrition at Hyderabad has come out with a new product, common salt foified with iron and iodine --> two in one salt (twin foified salt or double foified salt). Iodized oil --> It is another effective method for controlling goitre. IM injection of iodized oil (mostly poppy seed oil) is given. An average dose of 1 ml will provide protection for 4 years. 2. Iodine monitoring Neonatal hypothyroidism is a sensitive pointer to environmental iodine deficiency and can thus be an effective indicator for monitoring the impact of a programme. 3.

        "question": "True about cluster sampling are all except",
        "exp": "Sample size is same as that of simple random sampling Repeat from Nov 08 Sampling When a large propoion of individuals or items or units have to be studied, we take a sample. It is easier and more economical to study the sample than the whole population or universe. A sample is a subset of the population- the pa that is actually being observed or studied. It is impoant to ensure that the group of people or items include in the sample are representative of the whole population to be studied. Various sampling methods are used to select the sample groups. Sanzpling methods Simple random sampling: This is done by assigning a number to each unit in the population to be sampled and then using lottery method or a table of random numbers to select units to be included in the sample. The principle here is that every unit of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This method is applicable when the population is small, homogenous and readily available such as patients coming to hospital or lying in wards. Systematic sampling: In this method the first unit of the sample is selected at random and the subsequent units are selected in a systematic way i.e every fifth or tenth unit at regular intervals. For example in a malaria survey to take a 5 percent sample, all the houses are numbered first. Then the first house is selected at random between 1 and 5. then every 5(h house is selected from that point on. This method is popularly used in those cases when a complete list of population from which samples is to be drawn, is available. It is more often applied to field studies when the population is large, scattered and not homogenous. Stratified sampling: This method is used when the population is heterogenous with regards to characteristic under study. The population under study is first divided into homogenous groups or classes called strata and then the sample is drawn from each stratum at random in propoion to its size. This method of sampling gives representation to all strata of society or population such as selecting sample from defined areas, classes, religions, ages or sexes. For example a population to be sampled consists of people of different religions like Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians etc. In stratified sampling the population is first divided into religious groups and then samples are drawn from each group in propoion to its size. This method is paicularly useful where one is interested in analyzing the data by ceain characteristic of the population, viz Hindus, Muslims, Christians, age-groups etc. Cluster sampling: A cluster is a randomly selected group. This method is used when units of population are natural groups or clusters such as villages, wards, blocks, slums, schools etc. In this technique clusters are chosen at random from the entire population, and then these clusters are sampled. Each cluster should be a small scale representation of the total population. In single-stage cluster sampling, all the elements from each of the selected clusters are used. In two-stage cluster sampling, a random sampling technique is applied to the elements from each of the selected clusters. The main difference between cluster sampling and stratified sampling is that in cluster sampling the cluster is treated as the sampling unit so analysis is done on a population of clusters (at least in the first stage). In stratified sampling, the analysis is done on elements within strata. In stratified sampling, a random sample is drawn from each of the strata, whereas in cluster sampling only the selected clusters are studied. The main objective of cluster sampling is to reduce costs by increasing sampling efficiency. This contrasts with stratified sampling where the main objective is to increase precision. Cluster sampling is most often used to evaluate vaccination coverage in Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) and Universal Immunization Programme (U1P), where only 210 children, taking 7 from each of the 30 clusters are examined. Cluster sampling gives a high standard error but the data collection in this method is simpler and involves less time and cost than in other sampling techniques. Multistage sampling: In this method sampling procedure is carried out in several stages using random sampling techniques. Multistage sampling is used when the population units arranged in hierarchal groups. For examples farmers in India may be grouped into various states, then into districts, then into talukas, fuher into villages within the talukas and then farmers within the villages. Multistage sampling of this population of farmers would consist of first randomly selecting districts within each state, then selecting a subset of talukas within the selected districts, then selecting a subset of villages and finally selecting a sample of farmers within the villages. Multiphase sampling: In this method, pa of information is collected from the whole sample and pa from the subsample. For example in a tuberculosis survey, in the first phase, physical examination or Mantoux test may be done in all the cases; in the second phase X-ray of the chest may be done in Mantoux positive cases and in those with clinical symptoms: finally the sputum may be examined in X-ray positive cases. Thus number of samples in the second and third phases would become successively smaller and smaller. Survey by multiphase sampling would involve less cost and labour and would be more purposeful.",

The study groups, so defined, are observed over a period of time to determine the frequency of new incidence of the studied disease among them. The coho cannot therefore be defined as a group of people who already have the disease. Coho studies can either be performed prospectively or retrospectively from historical records. Prospective (longitudinal) coho studies between exposure and disease strongly aid in studying causal associations. The advantage of prospective coho study data is the longitudinal observation of the individual through time, and the collection of data at regular intervals, so recall error is reduced. However, coho studies are expensive to conduct, are sensitive to attrition and take a long follow-up time to generate useful data. Neveheless, the results that are obtained from long-term coho studies are of substantially superior quality to retrospective/cross-sectional studies, and coho studies are considered the gold standard in observational epidemiology. Moreover, coho studies are informative for efficiently studying a wide-range of exposure-disease associations. It is the most reliable mean of showing an association between a suspected risk factor and subsequent disease because it eliminates many of the problems of the case control study. Odd's ratio can be derived from a case control study, which is a measure of the strength of the association between risk factor and outcome.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., 150 Quaile The quailes are the four ranges defined by the three value discussed. o A quaile is any of the three values which divide the soed data set into four equal pas, so that each pa represents one fouh of the sample. From above mentioned lines it is very difficult to understand that what the quaile is. I am trying to explain in very simple language : ? o A quaile divides the data into four equal pas. o That means the data will have four equal pas i.e., 25 percent each. o So, the number of intercepts required will be 3, i.e., Q1, Q2, Q3. Q 1 is first (lowest) quale Q2 is second quaile Q3 is third (highest quaile) From above figure it is clear that : - i) Zero - Q I will cover 25% value ii) Zero - Q2 will cover 50 % value iii) Zero - Q3 will cover 75% value . iv) Zero - 100 will cover 100% value Zero - Ql, Ql- Q2, Q2-Q3 and Q3-100 all will cover 25% values among each of them. Zero-Q2, QI-Q3, Q2-100 will cover 50% values. Coming to question The first quaile Q1 = 1.5 litres. The third quaile Q3 = 4.5 litres The value between Q1 - Q3 = 50% (see above) So, 50% of total smokers (300) will have FEV between 1.5 to 4.5 litres. 50% of 300 = 150",

Selected from the village itself and accountable to it, the ASHA will be trained to work as an interface between the community and the public health system. Following are the key components of ASHA: ASHA must primarily be a woman resident of the village - married/ widowed/ divorced, preferably in the age group of 25 to 45 years. o She should be a literate woman with formal education up to class eight. This may be relaxed only if no suitable person with this qualification is available. o ASHA will be the first po of call for any health related demands of deprived sections of the population, especially women and children, who find it difficult to access health services o ASHA will be a health activist in the community who will create awareness on health and its social determinants and mobilize the community towards local health planning and increased utilization and accountability of the existing health services. She would be a promoter of good health practices. She will counsel women on bih preparedness, impoance of safe delivery, breastfeeding and complementary feeding, immunization, contraception and prevention of common infections including Reproductive Tract Infection/ Sexually Transmitted Infection ( Is/STI s) and care of the young child o She will arrange esco/accompany pregnant women & children requiring treatment/ admission to the nearest pre-identified health facility i.e. Primary Health Centre/ Community Health Centre/ First Referral Unit (PHC/CHC /FRU). o ASHA will provide primary medical care for minor ailments such as diarrhoea, fevers, and first aid for minor injuries. She will be a provider of Directly Observed Treatment Sho-course (DOTS) under Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme She will also act as a depot holder for essential provisions being made available to every habitation like Oral Rehyd ration Therapy (ORS), Iron Folic Acid Tablet (IFA), chloroquine, Disposable Delivery Kits (DDK), Oral Pills & Condoms, etc. A Drug Kit will be provided to each ASHA. o The general norm will be 'One ASHA per 1000 population'. In tribal, hilly, dese areas the norm could be relaxed to one ASHA per habitation, dependant on workload etc. o ASHA would be an honorary volunteer and would not receive any salary or honorarium. Her work would be so tailored that it does not interfere with her normal livelihood.",

Park 20/e, p 549 (19/e p503)1 Repeat from Nov 08 Net Protein Utilization (NPU): NPU is a method of assessing protein quality. It is the ratio of amino acid conveed to proteins to the ratio of amino acids supplied. Experimentally, this value can be determined by determining dietary protein intake and then measuring nitrogen excretion. One formula for NPU is: NPU = Nitrogen retained by the body/ Nitrogen intake X 100 As a value, NPU can range from 1 to 0, with a value of 1 indicating 100% utilization of dietary nitrogen as protein and a value of 0 an indication that none of the nitrogen supplied was conveed to protein. Ceain foodstuffs, such as eggs or milk, rate as I on an NPU cha. The NPU gives a more complete expression of protein quality than the amino acid score. The protein requirement varies with the NPU of dietary protein. If NPU is high, the protein requirement is low and vice versa. Amino acid score: Other method of assessing protein quality is amino acid score. Amino acid score is a measure of the concentration of each essential amino acid in the test protein expressed as a percentage of that amino acid in the reference protein (usually egg protein) Amino acid score Number of mg of one amino acid per g of protein/Number of mg of the same amino acid per g of egg protein X 100 Also Know Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS): Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score is a method of evaluating the protein quality based on the amino acid requirements of humans. It has been adopted by FAO/WHO as the preferred method for the measurement of the protein quality in human nutrition. The method is based on comparison of the concentration of the first limiting essential amino acid in the test protein with the concentration of that amino acid in a reference (scoring) pattern. This scoring pattern is derived from the essential amino acid requirements of the preschool-age child. The chemical score obtained in this way is corrected for true fecal digestibility of the test protein. A PDCAAS value of 1 is the highest, and 0 the lowest as the table demonstrates the ratings of common foods below. - whey 1.0 - egg white 1.0 - asein 1.0 - milk 1.0 The Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) is superior to other methods for evaluating the protein quality of food proteins for humans because it measures the quality of a protein based on the amino acid requirements of a 2- to 5-year old child (the most demanding age group), adjusted for digestibility. PDCAAS is based on a food protein's amino acid content, its true digestibility, and its ability to supply indispensable amino acids in amounts adequate to meet the amino acid requirements of a 2- to 5-year old child, the age group used as the standard",
