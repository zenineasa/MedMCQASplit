(b) Primary preventionLEVELS OF PREVENTION:* Primordial Level of Prevention: Is primary prevention (see below) in purest sense- It is the prevention of the emergence or development of risk factors in countries or population groups in which they have not yet appeared- Modes of Intervention:1. Individual Education2. Mass Education- Primordial Level is Best level of prevention for Non-communicable diseases* Primary Level of Prevention:- It is the action taken prior to onset of disease, which removes the possibility that a disease will ever occur- Modes of Intervention:1. Health Promotion: Is targeted at strengthening the host through a variety of approaches/interventions, e.g. Health Education, Environmental modifications, Nutritional interventions, Lifestyle and behavioral changes2. Specific Protection: Is targeting the prevention of disease through a specific intervention- Primary level of prevention is applied when 'risk factors are present, but disease has not yet taken place'- It signifies 'intervention in the Pre-pathogenesis Phase of a disease/ health problem'* Secondary Level of Prevention:- It halts the progress of disease at its' incipient stage and prevents complications- Modes of Intervention:1. Early Diagnosis: Detection of disturbances while biochemical, functional and morphological changes are still reversible or prior to occurrence of manifest signs and symptoms2. Treatment: Shortens period of communicability, reduces mortality and prevents occurrence of further cases (secondary cases) or any long-term disability- Secondary level of prevention is applied when disease has possibly set in: It attempts to arrest the disease process, seek unrecognized disease and treat it before irreversibility and reverse communicability of infectious diseases- National Health Programs by Govt, of India mostly operate at Secondary level of prevention- Secondary prevention is an imperfect tool in control of transmission of disease: It is more expensive and less effective than primary prevention- It is an important level of prevention for diseases like Tuberculosis, Leprosy and STDs* Tertiary Level of Prevention:- Is applied when disease has advanced beyond early stages: It aims to reduce or limit impairments and disabilities, minimize suffering caused by existing departures from good health- Modes of Intervention:1. Disability Limitation: It 'prevents the transition of disease from impairment to handicap'2. Rehabilitation: Training and retraining of an individual to the highest possible level of functional ability; It can be medical, vocational, social or psychological- Tertiary level of prevention signifies 'intervention in late pathogenesis phase'ALSO REMEMBER* All Vaccines (including Anti-rabies vaccine): Specific Protection mode of intervention, Primary Level of prevention* Screening is predominantly Secondary Level of Prevention with some component of Primary Prevention also",

The WHO Expert Committee considered the following dietary changes to be appropriate for high incidence populations: reduction of fat intake to 20-30 per cent of total energy intake consumption of saturated fats must be limited to less than 10 per cent of total energy intake; some of the reduction in saturated fat may be made up by mcmo- and poly-unsaturated fats a reduction of dietary cholesterol to below 100 mg per 1000 kcal per day an increase in complex carbohydrate consumption (i.e., vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes) avoidance of alcohol consumption; reduction of salt intake to 5 g daily or less .2. Blood pressure: It has been estimated that even a small reduction in the average blood pressure of the whole population by a mere 2 or 3 mm Hg would produce a large reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular complications. The goal of the population approach to high blood pressure would thus be to reduce mean population blood pressure levels. This involves a multifactorial approach based on a \"prudent diet\" (reduced salt intake and avoidance of a high alcohol intake), regular physical activity and weight control. The potential benefits and the safety and low cost of this advice would justify its implementation.3. Physical activity: Regular physical activity should be a part of normal daily life.

Damages the developing nervous system, resulting in IQ loss and impacts on learning, memory, and behavior in children. Cardiovascular and renal effects in adults and early effects related to anaemia.> Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Fuel combustion (electric utilities, big industrial boilers, vehicles) and wood burning. Worsens lung diseases leading to respiratory symptoms, increased susceptibility to respiratory infection.> Particulate Matter (PM) This is formed through chemical reactions, fuel combustion (e.g., burning coal, wood, diesel), industrial processes, farming (plowing, field burning), and unpaved roads or during road constructions. Short-term exposures can worsen heart or lung diseases and cause respiratory problems. Long-term exposures can cause heart or lung disease and sometimes premature deaths.> Sulfur Dioxide (SOS02 comes from fuel combustion (especially high-sulfur coal); electric utilities and industrial processes as well as natural occurances like volcanoes.

Under experimental conditions, the Aedes albopictus mosquito (also known as the Asian Tiger Mosquito) has been found to be a vector of West Nile Virus. The virus is transmitted through mosquito vectors, which bite and infect birds. The birds are amplifying hosts, developing sufficient viral levels to transmit the infection to other biting mosquitoes which go on to infect other birds (in the Western hemisphere the American robin and the American crow are the most common carriers) and also humans.

Do not distinguish between causes and associated factors5. No risk to subjects5. Not suited to the evaluation of therapy or prophylaxis of disease6. Allows the study of several different aetioiogical factors (e.g., smoking, physical activity and personality characteristics in myocardial infarction)6. Another major concern is the representativeness of cases and controls7. Risk factors can be identified. Rational prevention and control programmes can be established 8.
