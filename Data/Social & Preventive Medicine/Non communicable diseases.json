This code, known as the Declaration of Oslo, was amended by the 35th World Medical Assembly, Venice, Italy in October 1983 and states: The first moral principle imposed upon the physician is respect of human life from its beginning. Circumstances which bring the vital interests of a mother into conflict with the vital interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated. Diversity of response to this situation results from the diversity of attitudes towards the life of the unborn child. This is a matter of individual conviction and conscience which must be respected. It is not the role of the medical profession to determine the attitudes and rules of any paicular state or community in this matter, but it is our duty to attempt both to ensure the protection of our patients and to safeguard the rights of the physician within society. Therefore, where the law allows therapeutic aboion to be performed, the procedure should be performed by a physician competent to do so in premises approved by the appropriate authority. If the physician considers that his convictions do not allow him to advise or perform an aboion, he may withdraw while ensuring the continuity of (medical) care by a competent colleague. This statement, while it is endorsed by the General Assembly of the World Medical Association, is not to be regarded as binding on any individual member association unless it is adopted by that member association.

(2) Make school education upto the age 14 free and compulsory, and reduce drop-outs at primary and secondary school levels to below 20 per cent for both boys and girls. (3) Reduce infant moality rate to below 30 per 1000 live bihs. (4) Reduce maternal moality ratio to below 100 per 100,000 live bihs. (5) Achieve universal immunization of children against all vaccine preventable diseases. (6) Promote delayed marriage for girls, not earlier than age 18 and preferably after 20 years of age. (7) Achieve 80 per cent institutional deliveries and 100 per cent deliveries by trained persons. (8) Achieve universal access to information/counselling, and services for feility regulation and contraception with a wide basket of choices. (9) Achieve 100 per cent registration of bihs, deaths, marriage and pregnancy. (10) Contain the spread of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and promote greater integration between the management of reproductive tract infections (I) and sexually transmitted infections (ST!) and the National AIDS Control Organization. (11) Prevent and control communicable diseases. (12) Integrate Indian Systems of Medicine (ISM) in the provision of reproductive and child health services, and in reaching out to households. (13) Promote vigorously the small family norm to achieve replacement levels of TFR. (14) Bring about convergence in implementation of related social sector programmes so that family welfare becomes a people centred programme The NPP 2000 anticipates that proper implementation of this policy will help limit the population to 1,107 million (110 crores) in 2010, instead of 1,162 million (116 crores) as projected by the Technical Group on Population Projections. It is hoped that the TFR will reach the replacement level of 2.1 by 2010. The long-term objective of achieving a stable population by 2045, at a level consistent with the requirements of sustainable economic growth, social development, and environment protection will also require considerable effo and efficient implementation of the NPP.

It involves preventing the emergence and spread of CHD risk factors and life-styles that have not yet appeared or become endemic. This applies to developing countries in paicular. These countries should seek to preserve their traditional eating patterns and life- styles associated with low levels of CHD risk factors. Since the aetiology of CHD is multifactorial the approach to prevention should be multifactorial aimed at controlling or modifying as many risk factors as possible. The aim should be to change the community as a whole, not the individual subjects living in it. Several well-planned risk factor intervention trials (e.g., The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) in the US , The Stanford Hea Disease Prevention Programme in California, and The Noh Kerelia Project in Finland have demonstrated that primary prevention can achieve substantial reduction in the incidence of coronary hea disease.

The achievement of functional literacy implies (i) self-reliance in 3 R's, (ii) awareness of the causes of deprivation and the ability to move towards amelioration of their condition by paicipating in the process of development, (iii) acquiring skills to improve economic status and general well being, and (iv) imbibing values such as national integration, conservation of environment, women's equality, observance of small family norms.

Studies in this branch of biology examine such phenomena as adaptation, speciation, and population structure Population genetics began as a reconciliation of Mendelian inheritance and biostatistics models. Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural or sexual selection implausible. The Hardy-Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. According to this principle, the frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.

        "question": "Which of the following is maximally associated with hea disease",
        "exp": "Serum cholesterol as a risk factor for CHD It is nearly three decades since it became clear that elevation of serum cholesterol was one of the factors which carried an increased risk for the development of myocardial infarction. Today, there is a vast body of evidence showing a triangular relationship between habitual diet, blood cholesterol-lipoprotein levels and CHD, and that these relationships are judged to be causal. There is no population, in which CHD is common, that does not also have a relatively high mean level of cholesterol (i.e. greater than 200 mg/di in adults), which shows the cultural differences in serum cholesterol levels between two countries. Among Japan and Finland, Japan having the lowest incidence and Finland the highest incidence of CHD. The strength of the dietary-fat hypothesis is that observations in the Seven Countries Study (among others) fitted it well that is, the Japanese had low fat diets, low serum cholesterol and low incidence of CHD while the East Fins were at the other extreme. The weakness of the hypothesis is that studies of individuals have not shown such a relationship. This has been attributed to genetic and dietary intake differences between individuals. When we look at the various types of. lipoproteins, it is the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is most directly associated with CHD. While very low- density lipoprotein (VLDL) has also been shown to be associated with premature atherosclerosis, it is more strongly associated with peripheral vascular disease (e.g., intermittent claudication) than with CHD. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is protective against the development of CHD- the higher its mean level in a group of individuals, the lower the incidence of infarction in that group. HDL should be more than 40 mg/dl. To fuher refine CHD risk prediction based on serum lipid levels, a total \"cholesterol/HDL ratio\" has been developed. A ratio of less than 3.5 has been recommended as a clinical goal for CHD prevention. With newer techniques, high-density and low-density lipoproteins have been fuher subdivided into sub-fractions. Recent evidence indicates that levels of plasma apolipoprotein-A-1 (the major HDL protein) and apolipoprotein-B (the major LDL protein) are better predictors of CHD than HDL cholesterol or LDL cholesterol respectively. Therefore, measurement of apolipoproteins may replace lipoprotein cholesterol determinations in assessing the risk of CHD Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 387",

These recommendations can be valid for adults with disabilities. However adjustments for each individual based on their exercise capacity and specific health risks or limitations may be needed. There are multiple ways of accumulating the total of 150 minutes per week. The concept of accumulation refers to meeting the goal of 150 minutes per week by performing activities in multiple shoer bouts, of at least 10 minutes each, spread throughout the week then adding together the time spent during each of these bouts: e.g. 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity 5 times per week. Pregnant, postpaum women and persons with cardiac events may need to take extra precautions and seek medical advice before striving to achieve the recommended levels of physical activity for this age group. Inactive adults or adults with disease limitations will have added health benefits if moving from the category of \"no activity\" to \"some levels\" of activity. Adults who currently do not meet the recommendations for physical activity should aim to increase duration, frequency and finally intensity as a target to achieving them.

It consists in identifying those who have had RF and giving them one intramuscular injection of benzathine benzyl penicillin (1.2 million units in adults and 600,000 units in children) at intervals of 3 weeks. This must be continued for at least 5 years or until the child reaches 18 years whichever is later. For patients with carditis (mild mitral regurgitation or healed carditis) the treatment should continue for 10 years after the last attack, or at least until 25 years of age, which ever is longer. More severe valvular disease or post-valve surgery cases need life-long treatment. This prevents streptococcal sore throat and therefore recurrence of RF and RHD. However, the crucial problem is one of patient compliance as penicillin prophylaxis is a long-term affair.
