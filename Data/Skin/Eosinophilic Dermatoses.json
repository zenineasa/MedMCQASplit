Once. the skin is relatively drier and the eczema has entered into subacute stage, topical corticosteroids in creams or lotion preparations with/without topical antibiotics are prescribed. Moisturizers can start to be used in subacute stage. In chronic stage, owing to the lichen died skin, topical corticosteroids in ointment with external occlusion are preferred. \"Ref: Rook's Dermatology Eczemas and contact dermatitis generally go through three stages:Acute stage: Characterized by erythema, edema, oozing accompanied by itching.Subacute stage: The affected area in relatively dry compared to the acute stage. In this stage, scaling and crusting predominate.Chronic Stage: Unresolved eczema persisting for a long time evolve into chronic stage characterized lichenification of the skin. Lichenification refers to thickening of skin, increased skin markings and pigmentation of the skin.Acute contact dermatitis is best treated by moist compresses. No creams or ointment would stay on the skin at this stage (hence would be wasted if used).Once, the skin is relatively drier and the eczema has entered into subacute stage, topical corticosteroids in creams or lotion preparations are used.Moisturizers can be started in subacute stage.In chronic stage, owing to the lichenified skin, topical corticosteroids in ointment with external occlusion are preferred.For hyperkeratosis, salicylic acid is added to topical corticosteroids (in general 6% salicylic acid is added to 3% topical corticosteroids).High potency topical corticosteroids are used for chronic eczemas.Topical calcineurin inhibitors (Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) are indicated in childhood eczemas like atopic dermatitis.When therapy is prolonged, topical corticosteroids used for long time can produce a lot of side effects like atrophy, hypo or depigmentation, telangiectasia.Topical calcineurin inhibitors are safer in this regard, for areas with thin skin like the face.Oral corticosteroids, cyclosporine are used in special circumstances like extensive acute eczemas, erythroderma due to eczema, acute flare of atopic dermatitis.Stages of eczemaClinical featureTopical treatment of choiceAcuteErythema, edema, oozingMoist compressesSubacuteCrusting and scalingCreams and moisturizersChronicLichenificationOintments (with/without occlusion)TRE ATMENT OF CONTACT DERMATITISGeneral PrinciplesAvoid further contact w ith the allergen known/ identified.Short course of oral corticosteroids for severe dermatitis.Topical corticosteroids: Creams for subacute stage and ointment for chronic stage.
