Most lesions are present at bih and develop during infancy. They enlarge slowly during childhood and generally reach a stable size at adolescence. Lesions may be localized or diffuse. Linear configurations are common especially on the limbs and may follow skin tension lines or Blaschko's lines. The salient histological features are ? Perinuclear vacuolization of the cells in the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum. Irregular cellular boundaries peripheral to the vacuolization and increased number of irregularly :,aped large keratohyaline granules. Compact hyperkeratosis in stratum corneum. Darner white disease Autosomal dominant disease. Males and females are equally affected. Daffier white disease is not present at bih and usually begins in the first or second decade. Characteristic sites of prediliction are the face, forehead, scalp, chest and the hack (seborrhic sites). Clinical features consists of way papules and plaques in (seborrhic sites).

C: Trichophyton Tinea cruris, a pruritic superficial fungal infection of the groin and adjacent skin, is the second most common clinical presentation for dermatophytosis The most common etiologic agents for tinea cruris include Trichophyton rubrum and Epidermophyton floccosum; less commonly Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton verrucosum are involved. Tinea cruris is a contagious infection transmitted by fomites, such as contaminated towels or hotel bedroom sheets, or by autoinoculation from a reservoir on the hands or feet (tinea manuum, tinea pedis, tinea unguium). The etiologic agents in tinea cruris produce keratinases, which allow invasion of the cornified cell layer of the epidermis. Findings includes: Large patches of erythema with central clearing are centered on the inguinal creases and extend distally down the medial aspects of the thighs and proximally to the lower abdomen and pubic area. Scale is demarcated sharply at the periphery. In acute tinea cruris infections, the rash may be moist and exudative. Chronic infections typically are dry with a papular annular or arciform border and barely perceptible scale at the margin. Central areas typically are hyperpigmented and contain a scattering of erythematous papules and a little scale. Malassezia furfur is implicated in pityriasis versicolor and malassezia folliculitis.",

D: All of the above Melanopenic hypopigmentation is due to decrease in number of melanosomes, which could be due to: Genetic diseases-albinism, piebaldism A utoimmune diseases-vitiligo Post-inflammatory-Discoid lupus erythematosus Piebaldism is due to an absence of melanocytes in affected skin and hair follicles. The condition is present at bih and usually remains unchanged throughout life. This is caused by mutations of the KIT proto-oncogene. 14 point mutations, 9 deletions, 2 nucleotide splice mutations, and 3 inseions of the KIT gene are believed to be mutations causing piebaldism. The severity of the condition correlates with the site of the mutation within the KIT gene. Piebaldism is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder meaning half of an affected person's children will also have the condition. Piebaldism is one of the cutaneous signs of Waardenburg syndrome. Piebaldism is a rare inherited condition characterised by: White forelock in 80-90% of those affected (poliosis) White patch (due to absence of pigmentation) of the central poion of the forehead Eyebrow and eyelash hair may also be affected, either continuously or discontinuously with the forelock White patches of skin may also be seen on the face (paicularly the chin), trunk and extremities (hands and feet are not usually affected) Often a narrow border of hyperpigmented skin surrounds the white unpigmented patches Sometimes islands of normal or hyperpigmented skin occur within the white patches. Albinism is a condition in which people have little or no melanin pigment (compound that creates colour) in their eyes, skin or hair. Because of this people with albinism look a little different from other members of their family without albinism. They have very fair skin which is prone to sunburn, their hair is white or a very light colour, and they may squint a lot as their eyes are sensitive to sunlight.",

This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by multiple neural tumors, especially neurofibromas, pigmented hamaomas of the iris (Lisch nodules), and cafe au lait spots, which usually occur over nerve trunks. Although the majority of neurofibromas in this disease are benign, the tumors can be quite disfiguring and psychologically damaging. Basal cell carcinoma is a common, slow-growing tumor of sun-exposed skin. It develops in adulthood after years of chronic sun damage. Although malignant melanoma may arise from large congenital nevi, BCC does not. Neuroblastoma is a common childhood tumor that arises anywhere along the sympathetic chain, and most commonly in the adrenal medulla. The tumor usually presents as an abdominal mass and is not associated with skin findings. The ocular neoplasm associated with neurofibromatosis is the Lisch nodule, not the retinoblastoma.

Melanogenesis also occurs during anagen phase. This phase lasts for 3 years (2-6 years). Most of the hair (75-80%) are in anagen phase at a given time. 2) Catagen phase (Transition phase) It is the transition phase between anagen and telogen. 3% of hair are in this phase. During this phase growth stops and outer root sheat shrinks and attaches to root of hair known as club hair. This phase lasts for 2-3 weeks. 3) Telogen phase (Resting or degenerative phase) This phase is the resting phase and lasts for 100 days (3 months). About 25-100 telogen hair are shed normally each day. 10-15% of hair are in this phase. After telogen phase the cycle is complete and the new hair, which stas growing in same follicle, pushes this old hair (who has completed the hair cycle) --> Old hair is lost and new hair stas growing. This hair cycle of one hair is independent of the cycle of neighboring hair, i.e., the neighboring hair follicles are not synchronized in growth, this is called Mosaic.

Both forms are associated with increased hepatic iron stores. Predominant clinical feature is a chronic photosensitivity characterized by increased fragality of sun exposed skin, paicularly areas subject to repeated trauma such as dorsum of hands, forearms, face and ears. The predominant skin lesions are vesicles and bullae, that rupture, producing moist erosion, often with a hemorrhagic base, that heal slowly with crusting and purplish discolouration of the affected skin. Hyperichosis, mottled pigmentary change, and scleroderma like induration are associated features. - Confirmation of diagnosis is done by measurement of urinary porphyrin excretion, plasma porphyrin assay and by assay of erythrocyte and/or hepatic uroporphyrinogen decorboxylase. Erythropoietic porphyria - Erythropoietic porphyria originate in the bone marrow and is d/t decrease in mitochondrial enzyme ferrochelatase; congenital type is d/t deficiency of URO synthetase. - Clinical features include an acute photosensitivity, characterized by subjective burning and stinging of exposed skin that often develops during or just after sun exposure. These may be skin swelling, and after repeated episodes, wax like scarring. - Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of elevated levels of free erythrocytes protoporphyrins Detection of increased plasma protoporphyrin helps to differentiate lead poisoning & iron deficiency anemia; in both of which elevated erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels occur in the absence of cutaneous photosensitivity & of elevated plasma protoporphyrin levels. * Seborrhic Dermatitis: presents with greasy scales & severe dandruff.

        "question": "Ashleaf spots are seen in: March 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Tuberous Sclerosis Tuberous sclerosis/ tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare, multi-system genetic disease that causes benign tumours to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, hea, eyes, lungs, and skin. TSC is caused by mutations on either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode for the proteins hamain and tuberin respectively. These proteins act as tumour growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. The physical manifestations of tuberous sclerosis are due to the formation of hamaia (malformed tissue such as the coical tubers), hamaomas (benign growths such as facial angiofibroma and subependymal nodules) and, very rarely, cancerous hamaoblastomas. Central nervous system Classic intracranial manifestations of tuberous sclerosis include subependymal nodules and coical/ subcoical tubers. Kidneys Between 60 and 80% of TSC patients have benign tumors (hamaomas) of the kidneys called angiomyolipomas (AML) frequently causing hematuria. Lungs Patients with TSC can develop progressive replacement of the lung parenchyma with multiple cysts. This process is identical to another disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosi (LAM). Hea Rhabdomyomas are benign tumors of striated muscle. Skin The most common skin abnormalities include: - Facial angiofibromas (\"adenoma sebaceum\"): A rash of reddish spots or bumps, which appear on the nose and cheeks in a butterfly distribution. - Ungual or subungual fibromas: Small fleshy tumors that grow around and under the toenails or fingernails. - Hypomelanic macules (\"ash leaf spots\"): White or lighter patches of skin that may appear anywhere on the body and are caused by a lack of melanin. These are usually the only visible sign of TSC at bih. In fair-skinned individuals a Wood's lamp (ultraviolet light) may be required to see them. - Forehead plaques: Raised, discolored areas on the forehead. - Shagreen patches: Areas of thick leathery skin that are dimpled like an orange peel, usually found on the lower back or nape of the neck. Eyes Retinal lesions, called astrocytic hamaomas, appear as a greyish or yellowish-white lesion in the back of the globe on ophthalmic examination.",

The condition is universal; people of all genders, ages and ethnic groups are susceptible; but SLE is 3 times more common in black people than in white. So highest prevalence is in black women and lowest in white men. - According to American rheumatism association diagnostic criteria of SLE, it may present with photosensitive, butterfly (malar) rash or discoid rash (resembling chronic DLE) Q and non erosive ahritis, oral/nasopharyngeal ulcerations, serositis, renal/neurological/hematological/ immunological disorder and ANA. - Systemic constitutional symptoms like fatigue, malaise, fever, anorexia and weight lossQ are present in 95% of patients (although these are not included in diagnostic criteria). ANA are positive in > 98% of patients so repeated negative tests suggests that the diagnosis is not SLE, unless other antibodies are present. High titer Ig antibodies to Sm antigen & ds DNA are both specific for SLE and, therefore our the diagnosis in presence of compatible clinical symptoms . Presence of multiple autoantibodies without clinical symptoms should not be considered diagnostic for SLE, although such persons are at increased risk. Nephritis is usually the most serious manifestation of SLE, since nephritis & infections are the leading causes of moality in 1st decade of disease. Since nephritis is mostly asymptomatic, urinalysis should be done in suspected cases. Renal biopsy to classify nephritis (minimal mesangial, proliferative mesangial, focal, diffuse glomerulonephritis, membranous and advanced sclerotic) is useful in planning current and near future therapies.",

Close examination reveals a friable mucosa, but no well-defined aphthous ulcers. Biopsy of perilesional mucosa demonstrates acantholysis; direct immunofluorescence demonstrates an intraepidermal band of IgG and C3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "This is pemphigus vulgaris, in which autoantibody directed against transmembrane cadherin adhesion molecules induced acantholysis (breakdown of epithelial cell-cell connections) with resulting intraepidermal blister formation. It may develop spontaneously or following triggers such as drugs (thiols, penicillamine), physical injury (burns), cancer, pregnancy, other skin diseases, and emotional stress. Pemphigus vulgaris is a relatively rare blistering disease; it is seen more commonly in patients with Jewish or Mediterranean heritage. In addition to the usually prominent oral ulcers, uncomfoable skin erosions can also occur when the blisters rupture rapidly and are not observed. The epidermis at the edge of these erosions is often easily disrupted by sliding pressure (Nikolsky sign). Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by deeper blisters, occurring at the dermal-epidermal junction. Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by severe, intense pruritus and groups of papules and vesicles. Herpes simplex I or II can show multinucleated giant cells on scrapings of the ulcer base.

It is oxidase positive like other Neisseria species, from which it is distinguished by their ability to grow on selective media & to utilize glucose but not maltose, sucrose or lactose. Gonorrhoea is, the second most common (after Chlamydia trachomatis which is the most common) genital /sexually transmitted infection in US, UK and other developed countriesQ (Harrison 1442; Rook's 34.24). The incidence of gonorrhea is higher in developing countriesQ than industrialized nations predominantly affecting young, nonwhite, unmarried, less educated urban population. (Harrison 1220) Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of non gonococcal urethritis (NGU) and postgonococcal urethritis (PGU)Q. PGU refers to NGU developing in men 2-3 weeks after treatment of gonococcal urethritis with single doses of agents such as penicillin or cephalosporins which lack activity against Chlamydia. In US most of acute urethritis cases are NGU and C. trachomatis is implicated in most (30-50%) of these casesQ. The other causes of NGU are Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Gonorrhoea is a STD which commonly manifests as cervicitis (primary site of infection in females), urethritis (most common/primary site of infection in males presenting as rapid onset severe burning dysuria with profuse purulent discharge)Q, proctitis & conjunctivitis. If untreated it can 1/t local complications such as endometritis, salpingitis, tuboovarian abscessQ, baholinitis, peritonitis and perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh Cuis Syndrome) in females; peri urethritis and epididymitisQ in male patients and ophthalmia neonatorum in new borns.

Because of ascending spread of infection testis is spared or (uncommonly) last to be involvedQ only after urethritis, prostatitis, epididymitis in gonorrhea. Single dose regimens of 3rd generation cephalosporins ceftriaxone (IM) and cefixime (oral) are the mainstays of therapyQ for uncomplicated gonococcal infection of urethra, cervix, rectum, or pharynx. Septinomycin is an alternative (2nd) regimen for uncomplicated gonococcal infections in penicillin allergic patients. All 3 drugs are suitable for pregnant & breast feeding women. The new management for complaints of urethral discharge involves a combined modality of treatment for N. gonorrhea and C. trachomatisQ as most cases are d/t coinfection with both pathogens and incorporate an agent eg. azithromycin or doxycycline that is effective agenist chlamydial infection. Pregnant women who should not take doxycycline, should receive concurrent treatment with a macrolide antibiotic for possible chlamydial infection.

In skin they infect most superficial layer of the epidermis i.e. stratum corneum. They do not penetrate living tissues. Dermatophytes cause a variety of clinical conditions, collectively known as dermatophytosis, tinea or ringworm.

What is the likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Erythema ab igne (EAI) is characterized as localized areas of reticulated erythema and hyperpigmentation due to chronic and repeated exposure to infrared radiation. Patients with erythema ab igne have a history of repeated exposures to heat at a lower level than that which causes a thermal burn. The exposure, which need not be of long duration, results in cutaneous hypehermia in the range of 43-47degC. No definitive therapy is available for erythema ab igne. Reducing or eliminating exposure to the heat source early in the erythema ab igne disease process may reverse the hyperpigmentation. In cases of sho duration, complete resolution occurs with removal of the offending heating device. More advanced cases may respond somewhat to tretinoin, and 5-fluorouracil cream can help clear epithelial atypia. It has been described in the setting of internal inflammation (chronic low back pain, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease) and primary or metastatic cancer (rectal cancer, pancreatic carcinoma, myeloma).

Flash lamp-pumped PDL uses a high-power Xenon flashlamp to excite rhodamine(organic) dye to produce a pulse of yellow light that is absorbed by oxyhemoglobin. Pulsed lasers allowed for more precise targeting of oxyhemoglobin containing vessels with less thermal and mechanical injury of surrounding tissue. Because of emission of continuous thermal energy 1/t scarring and pigmentary alteration, the use of early lasers such as argon laser (488/514nm), argon pumped tunable laser (488 to 638nm), copper and bromide laser (578nm), potassium -titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser (532 nm) and krypton laser (568nm) is limited. 585nm sho pulse PDL is probably optimal for treating paediatric PWS because vessel diameters are relatively small. Success rate is 50-90%; the size of vessels, its depth and density will influence the response. Factors oring a good response to PDL are presence of more superficially located vessels, flat and red/scarlet (as opposed to pink and purple) PWS on head and neck (a compared to other body sites), as well as youth. Although peripheral facial lesions respond better than midline-centrofacial or cheeks. Side effects of PDL are few and includes bruising (in all cases), pain, swelling, crusting bleeding, pyogenic granuloma, both hypo and hyper-pigmentation, pial re-emergence and redarkening. 2nd generation PDLs, emit light with a longer wave length of 595nm (absorption of which by Hb02 is 5 times lower), longer pulse width, higher flUences with addition of cooling system. This may be suitable for deeper, bigger vessels in resistant or adult PWS. In PDL resistant capillary malformations KTP laser may produce extra lightening. Hyperophic and PDL resistant PWS are sometimes treated with near infrared lasers such as alexandrite (755nm) and Nd: YAG (1064nm) laser, multiple pass irradiation with two PDL passes:1st at 590-600nm and 2nd at 585nm, and intense pulsed light (e.g. photoderm) or combined pulsed dye & Nd:YAG laser. Other possibilities under investigation include electro-optical synergy and vaccum assisted laser treatment. Adult patients in whom progressive vascular ectasia has resulted in very exophytic lesions are probably best treated with CO2 laser.",

Correct diagnosis is essential because untreated temporal aeritis can involve the ophthalmic aery, leading to irreversible blindness. Atherosclerosis is almost never seen in the distal (lower blood pressure) pa of the temporal aery. Fibrinoid necrosis is a feature of polyaeritis nodosa, not temporal aeritis.

The primary cutaneous lesions are pruritic, polygonal, flat-topped, violaceous papules. Close examination of the surface of these papules often reveals a network of gray lines (Wickham's striae). The skin lesions may occur anywhere but have a predilection for the wrists, shins, lower back, and genitalia. Involvement of the scalp, lichen planopilaris, may lead to scarring alopecia, and nail involvement may lead to permanent deformity or loss of fingernails and toenails. LP commonly involves mucous membranes, paicularly the buccal mucosa, where it can present a spectrum of disease from a mild, white, reticulate eruption of the mucosa, to a severe, erosive stomatitis. Erosive stomatitis may persist for years and may be linked to an increased risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Ref: Harrison's Internal Medicine;Pa 2.

Diagnosis of PLR is confirmed by skin biopsy and by performing photo-test procedures (i.e. photo-patch test & photo provocative tests)Q. Phototoxicity - is a non-immunological reaction caused by photo toxic drugs - amiodarone, dacarbazine, fluroquinolones, 5-FU, furosemide, nalidixic acid, phenothiazines, psoralens, retinoids, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, tetracyclines, thiazides, vinblastin. The usual clinical manifestations include erythema resembling a sunburn reaction that quickly desquamates, or \"peels\", within several days. In addition, edema, vesicles and bullae may occur. Photo allergy - is immune mediated, less common reaction caused by - 6-methyl-coumarin, aminobenzoic acid and esters, bithionol, chlorpromazine, diclofenac, fluroquinolones, halogenated salicylanilides, hypericin (st John's Wo), Musk ambrette, piroxicam, promethazine, Sulfonamides and Sulfonylureas. The clinical manifestations typically differs from those of phototoxicity in that an intensely pruritic eczematous dermatitis tends to predominate and evolves into lichenified, thickened, \"leathery\" changes in sun exposed areas. A small subset of patients (5-10%) may develop a persistent equisite hypersensitivity to light even when the offending drug or chemical is identified and eliminated, a condition known as persistent light reaction. - A very uncommon type of persistent photosensitivity is known as chronic actinic dermatitis. These patients are typically elderly men with a long history of preexisting allergic contact dermatitis or photosensitivity. They are usually exquisitely sensitive to UV-B, UV-A and visible wave lengths (ie manifest a broad spectrum of UV - hyperresponsiveness). - Diagnostic confirmation of phototoxicity & photoallergy can be done by using photo test procedures. For phototoxicity & photoallergy UV-A radiation (MED = minimal erythema dose) is used. Patients with persistent light reaction characteristically show diminished threshold to erythema evoked by UV -B. In solar uicaria, lesions occur within minutes of sun exposure, on exposed areas.",

        "question": "A 30 year old male presents to the dermatologist with silvery, scaling plaques on his elbows and knees. His mother has been afflicted with the same condition in the past. The most likely diagnosis is ?",
        "exp": "Psoriasis vulgaris usually appears on the nails, knees, elbows, and scalp. It does not generally affect the mucous membranes. Lesions are well-demarcated coral-colored plaques with a white or silvery scale (classic clue). Histologically, epidermal hyperplasia causing thickening and lengthening of the rete ridges is apparent, as is thinning of the epidermis over the dermal papillae. There is a recognized genetic component to this condition. Peak incidence is at age 30. Here's a point-saving strategy: It is easy to get confused on this question because of the similar looking answer choices, especially under time pressure. Be extra careful in such cases to mark the proper choice on your answer grid. Acne rosacea affects the central face. Erythema, telangiectasias, acneform lesions (papules, cysts, pustules), and rhinophyma (telangiectasias and hyperplasia of nasal soft tissue) are found in various combinations. It is common from ages 30-50. Women are affected three times more frequently than men, but the syndrome is more severe in the latter. Acne vulgaris causes comedones, papules, and cysts. It may be related to hormones, drugs, diet, irritants, and genetic factors. Allergy to Propionibacterium acnes has been found to contribute to this condition. Pemphigus vulgaris stas with small vesicles, usually on the oral or nasal mucosa, then spreads to other pas of the body. Bullae are delicate and flaccid. The condition is due to autoantibodies to intercellular junctions between keratinocytes. Nikolsky's sign (production of blistering by light stroking or rubbing of the skin) is positive. Pemphigus is most common from ages 40-60. Ref: Suurmond D. (2009). Section 3. Psoriasis. In D. Suurmond (Ed), Fitzpatrick's Color Atlas & Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology, 6e.",

Psoriasis is associated with ceain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, paicularly human leukocyte antigen Cw6 (HLA-Cw6). Clinical findings: The skin almost always is affected before the eyes. Ocular findings occur in approximately 10% of the patients. The nonocular symptoms are related to rash and psoriatic ahritis: - Psoriatic ahritis can cause stiffness, pain, throbbing, swelling, or tenderness of the joints. - The distal joints, such as the fingers, toes, wrists, knees, and ankles, are affected most often. The most common ocular symptoms are redness and tearing due to conjunctivitis or blepharitis. Corneal involvement -The most common finding is punctate keratitis. Uvea: Usually, anterior uveitis can be seen in association with psoriatic ahritis. The most common skin manifestations are scaling erythematous macules, papules, and plaques. The most common type of psoriasis is chronic stationary psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris). This involves the scalp, extensor surfaces, genitals, umbilicus, and lumbosacral and retroauricular regions. Psoriasis inversa: It involves flexural surfaces and interiginous areas, and it is not associated with scaling. Eruptive psoriasis: It involves the upper trunk and upper extremities. Most often, it is seen in younger patients. Other forms: Psoriatic erythroderma is a generalized form. When the scales are removed, small droplets of blood appear within a few seconds; this is known as the Auspitz sign. KObner phenomenon is the appearance of psoriatic lesions in previously uninvolved areas after irritation or trauma. Biopsy of the skin lesion may reveal basal cell hyperplasia, proliferation of subepidermal vasculature, absence of normal cell maturation, and keratinization.",

Calcineurin inhibitors such as topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus have recently been shown to be safe and effective, and is especially useful on the face and neck where strong steroid creams may cause skin thinning. Narrowband UVB phototherapy is helpful in many patients, paicularly in combination with calcineurin inhibitors, and perhaps with calcipotriol cream (usually used in psoriasis). PUVA. This form of light treatment requires the patient to take a psoralen medicine and then be exposed to ultraviolet light (UVA). Gradual but paial repigmentation may results. Hands and feet respond poorly, faces and trunks do better. When the treatment is stopped, some of the pigment disappears again. PUVA takes less than five minutes twice weekly, and is continued for up to two years. PUVA is unsuitable for children or very fair skinned people. The pigment loss should have been present for less than 5 years. Surgical treatment: Melanocytes transfer Blister grafting",

The HTLV-associated T-cell leukemia generally presents as described above, and is very aggressive, progressing to death in under 1 year. AIDS , acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, is transmitted through the HIV virus. Although both viruses are RNA retroviruses and both infect CD4+ T cells, the diseases they produce are distinct. Autoimmune diseases produced after infection are typified by rheumatic fever after infection with Streptococcus. There is speculation that EBV virus (Epstein-Barr virus) may produce the autoimmune reactions in rheumatoid ahritis, but autoimmunity plays no role in leukemia after HTLV-1 infection. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions are T-cell-mediated immune responses typified by the subcutaneous reaction to tuberculin in sensitized individuals.

        "question": "Patient with gluten-sensitive enteropathy has a lifelong history of periodic crops of intensely pruritic, grouped, papular or vesicular lesions on the elbows, knees, sacrum, and shoulders. Because the vesicles are intensely pruritic, the patient routinely scratches the top off them, which relieves the pruritus. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "The condition described is dermatitis herpetiformis, which is strongly associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac sprue), and often has a life-long, intermittent course. Clinically, patients have (excoriated) groups of papules and vesicles on an erythematous base. The lesions tend to involve the extensor surfaces of the extremities and the buttocks. Microscopically, the lesions show subepidermal papillary dermal neutrophilic abscesses, with granular deposits of IgA and C3 in dermal papillary tips. Patients may respond dramatically to dapsone therapy. Bullous pemphigoid produces large, tense blisters. Herpes simplex I is characterized by crops of vesicles, but is not paicularly associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Pemphigus vulgaris usually shows prominent oral involvement.
