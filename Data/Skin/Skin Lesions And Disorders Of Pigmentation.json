Pityriasis alba* Occurs predominantly in children between the ages of 3 and 16 years, the sexes are equally susceptible.* The individual lesion is a rounded, oval or irregular plaque, which is red, pink or skin-colored and has fine lamellar or branny scaling. Initially, the erythema may be conspicuous and there may even be minimal serous crusting. Later, the erythema subsides completely, and at the stage at which the lesions are commonly seen by a physician they show only persistent fine scaling and hypopigmentation.* There are usually several patches ranging from 0.5to2cm in diameter, but they may be larger, especially on the trunk. In children, the lesions are often confined to the face, and are most common around the mouth, chin and cheeks. In 20% of affected children the neck, arms and there are scattered lesions on the trunk and limbs.* The course is extremely variable. The average duration of the common facial form in childhood is a year or more.P.
