        "exp": "Ans. (A) High blood: gas partition coefficient(Ref: Katzung 11th/e p427)The depth of anesthesia depends on the partial pressure of anesthetic in CNS. The transfer of anesthetic into the brain starts only after the blood is fully saturated (or, in other words partial pressure of the anesthetic in blood equals the partial pressure in the inspired air). The speed of transfer of anesthetic to the brain determines its onset of action (rapid vs slow induction of anesthesia) and is dependent on the solubility of anesthetic in the blood. Solubility of an anesthetic is directly related to its blood/gas partition coefficient: highly soluble anesthetics have high blood/gas partition coefficient.If the agent is poorly soluble the amount of gas needed to saturate the blood is small and saturation occurs fairly quickly. Nitrous oxide is an example of poorly soluble gas with a blood/gas partition coefficient of 47. On the graph above the curve of partial pressure of NO in blood rises rapidly. In the highest point on the curve the partial pressure on NO in blood equals that in the inspired air, and the transfer to brain occurs.The second curve (drug A) portrays the process of blood saturation for a highly soluble gas. The higher the solubility the more gas can be taken up by blood before it is saturated. Note that the curve of the partial pressure of drug A in blood rises slower than that for NO. When the blood is fully saturated with NO the partial pressure of drug A in blood is approximately 25% of that in inspired air. For drug A, it takes a longer time to fully saturate the blood and to start transfer in tissues. Drug A, therefore is characterized with high blood/gas partition coefficient and slower onset of action.EffectPoorly soluble gas NOHighly soluble gas (Halothane)Amount needed to saturate the bloodSmallLargeRise in tension of gas in bloodRapidSlowEquilibrium with the brainRapidSlowOnset of actionRapidSlow",

So, the drugs used in outpatient anaesthesia are those which have short duration of action. Anaesthetic techniques and agents ideal for day care surgery arePremedicationo Usually premedication is not used. However in anxious patients, midazolam is the drug of choice, which should be given 1-2 hours before surgery with sip of water by oral route or 30 min. Before surgery by i.m. route. If patient is prone to nausea nad vomiting, dolasetron is the drug of choice. Ondansetron is an alternative.Airwayo Laryngeal mask airway is preferred over intubation.Intravenous anaestheticso Intravenous route is the preferred method for induction. Propofol is the intravenous anaesthetic of choice for induction because of its smooth induction and rapid recovery'. Antiemetic action of propofol is also beneficial ? use of propofol for induction or maintenance of anaesthesia is associated with a reduced incidence of post - operative nausea and vomiting.Inhalational agentso Inhalational anaesthetics are preferred for maintenance. Desflurane (1st choice) and sevoflurane (2nd choice) are agents of choice. These agents are used along with N2O as N2O decreases the requirement of other anaesthetics hence fastening the recovery'. Halothane and isoflurane have largely been replaced by the less soluble desflurane and sevoflurane.Muscle relaxantso Mivacurium is the muscle relaxant of choice because of its short duration of action. Succinylcholine should be avoided as it causes post - operative myalgia. However, if intubation is required, succinylcholine remains the agent of choice.Opioid analgesicso Opioids compounds are frequently administered during anaesthesia to suppress autonomic responses to tracheal intubation and painful (noxious) surgical stimuli. These drugs are also useful supplements to inhaled anaesthetics during maintenance period. Alfentanil is the agent of choice because of rapid onset andshorter duration of action. Remifentanil is emerging as an alternative because of much shorter duration of action. Fentanyl or sufentanil can also be used.",

It inhibits the breakdown of ACh at the motor end plate. This results in the increased activity of ACh that causes depolarization of motor end plate by opening Na+ channels (increasing the influx of Na+). It possesses some direct agonistic activity on NM receptors resulting in depolarization. In addition, a minor effect to increase the release of ACh at motor end plate is also present.",
