However, respiratory depression can occur after the drug is injected into the epidural space and may require reversal with naloxone.Effects such as pruritus and nausea and vomiting are common after epidural and subarachnoid administration of opioids and may also be reversed with naloxone if necessary.Currently, the epidural route is favored because systemic adverse effects are less common",
