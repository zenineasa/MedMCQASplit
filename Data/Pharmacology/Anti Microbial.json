Of these drugs, only rifampin is bactericidal.* The sulfones (folate antagonists), the foremost of which is dapsone, were the first antimicrobial agents found to be effective for the treatment of leprosy and are still the mainstay of therapy.* Other antimicrobial agents active against M. leprae in animal models and at the usual daily doses used in clinical trials include ethionamide/prothionamide; the aminoglycosides streptomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin (but not gentamicin or tobramycin); minocycline; clarithromycin; and several fluoroquinolones, particularly preferred is ofloxacin.* Next to rifampin, minocycline, clarithromycin, and ofloxacin appear to be most bactericidal for M. leprae, but these drugs have not been used extensively in leprosy control programs. Most recently, rifapentine and moxifloxacin have been found to be especially potent against M. leprae in mice.

Fast multiplying organisms are rapidly killed but quiescent ones are only inhibited.* Acts on intracellular as well as extracellular TB bacilli and is equally active in acidic and alkaline medium.* MOA: Inhibit synthesis of mycolic acid, which is a unique fatty acid component of mycobacterial cell wall.* If given alone, resistance occurs in about 2-3 months* Most common mechanism of INH resistance: Mutation of catalase-peroxidase gene > Mutation of inh-A gene.* Adverse effects:# Isoniazid-induced hepatitis is the most common major toxic effect# Peripheral neuropathy is observed in 10-20% of patients# Neuropathy is due to a relative pyridoxine (Vit B6) deficiency.

Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are more likely to be encountered when therapy is continued for more than 5 days, at higher doses, in the elderly, and in the setting of renal insufficiency. Concurrent use with loop diuretics (eg, furosemide, ethacrynic acid) or other nephrotoxic antimicrobial agents (eg. vancomycin or amphotericin) can potentiate nephrotoxicity and should be avoided if possible. Neomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin are the most ototoxic agents. Streptomycin and gentamicin are the most vestibulotoxic, bleomycin, tobramycin, and gentamicin are the most nephrotoxic. --Katzung 12/e p824\"Vestibular and auditory dysfunction can follow the administration of any of the aminoglycosides, and ototoxicity may become a dose-limiting adverse effect. Aminoglycoside induced ototoxicity results in irreversible, bilateral high-frequency hearing loss and temporary vestibular hypofunction. \"--Goodman Gillman 12/e p1512\"Auditory impairment, sometimes permanent, may follow the use of vancomycin or teicoplanin. Ototoxicity is associated with excessively high concentrations of these drugs in plasma (60-100 ug/mL of vancomycin). \"-Goodman Gillman 12/e p1542\"The fatal oral dose of quinine for adults is ~2-8 g. Quinine is associated with a triad of dose-related toxicides when given at full therapeutic or excessive doses. These are cinchonism, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. Hearing and vision are particularly affected Functional impairment of the eighth nerve results in tinnitus, decreased auditory acuity, and vertigo. Visual signs consist of blurred vision, disturbed color perception, photophobia, diplopia, night blindness, constricted visual fields, scotomata, mydriasis, and even blindness. \"--Goodman Gillman 12/e p1407Drugs causing OtotoxicityAntibiotics* AminoglycosidesQ* VancomycinQChemotherapeutic drugs* CisplatinQDiuretics* Ethacrynic acidQ* FurosemideQOthers* QuinineQ* SalicylatesQ Aminoglycosides Side-Effects MaximumMinimumOtotoxicity* AmikacinQ (Auditory)* StreptomycinQ (Vestibular)* NetilmycinQNephrotoxicity* Neomycin >GentamicinQ* StreptomycinQNeuromuscular Blockade* Neomycin >StreptomycinQ* TobramycinQ",

The preferred regimen is 2 g metronidazole as a single oral dose for both males and females.Metronidazole is the agent of choice for all symptomatic forms of amebiasis, including colitis and liver abscess. The recommended dose is 500-750 mg metronidazole taken orally three tiniesdaily for 7-10 days. The daily dose for children is 35-50 mg/kg, given in three divided doses, for 7-10 days.. E. histolytica persist in most patients who recover from acute amebiasis after metronidazole therapy, so it is recommended that all such individuals also be treated with a luminal amebicide.Metronidazole is used for treatment of giardiasis.Metronidazole is used for the treatment of serious infections owing to susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including bacteroides, Clostridium, fusobacterium, peptococcus. peptostreptococcus. eubacterium. And helicobacter.Metronidazole achieves clinically effective levels in bones, joints, and the CNS and can be given intravenously when oral administration is not possible..Metronidazole is used as a component of prophylaxis of postoperative mixed bacterial infections and is used as a single agent to treat bacterial vaginosis.Metronidazole is used increasingly as primary therapy for pseudomembranous colitis due to Clostridium difficile infection. At doses of250-500 mg orally three times daily for 7-14 days, metronidazole is effective and less expensive than oral vancomycin. Metronidazole also is used in patients with Crohn disease who have perianal fistulas or significant colonic diseaseMILTEFOSINEMiltefosine is the first orally available therapy for leishmaniasis.It is safe and effective treatment for visceral leishmaniasis and has also shown >95% efficacy against cutaneous leishmaniasisNIFURTIMOXNifurtimox and benznidazole are trypanocidal against both the trypomastigote and amastigote forms of T. cruzi.

Half-life of vancomycin can increase to 6-10 days in case of anephric patients.Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside. Aminoglycosides are most potent to cause both ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.

Superficial infections caused by Candida species may be treated with topical applications of clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, ciclopirox olamine, nystatin, or amphotericin B. Chronic generalized mucocutaneous candidiasis is responsive to long-term therapy with oral ketoconazole.Terbinafine# Its mechanism of action: inhibition of fungal squalene epoxidase, blocking ergosterol biosynthesis.# Terbinafine 1% cream or spray is applied twice daily and is effective in tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis. Terbinafine is less active against Candida species and Malassezia furfur, but the cream also can be used in cutaneous candidiasis and tinea versicolor.# Terbinafine, given as one 250-mg tablet daily, is at least as effective for nail onychomycosis as 200 mg daily of itraconazole, and slightly more effective than pulse itraconazole therapy. Duration of treatment varies with the site being treated but typically is 3 months. Although not approved for this use, terbinafine (250 mg daily) also is effective in ringworm elsewhere on the body.# Terbinafine is not recommended in patients with marked azotemia or hepatic failure, because in the latter condition, terbinafine plasma levels are increased by unpredictable amounts. Rifampin decreases and cimetidine increases plasma terbinafine concentrations.# The drug is well tolerated, with a low incidence of gastrointestinal distress, headache, or rash. Rarely, hepatotoxicity, severe neutropenia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis may occur. The drug is contraindicated in pregnancy (category B). I",

Champe page 353POST ANTIBIOTIC EFFECT:Post antibiotic effect (PAE) is a persistent suppression of microbial growth that occurs after levels of antibiotic have fallen below the MIC. To measure the PAE of an antibiotic ca test culture is first incubated in antibiotic containing medium anfd then transferred to antibiotic free medium. PAE is defined as the length of time it takes (after the transfer) for the culture to acheeve log phase growth.Antimicrobial drugs exhibiting a long PAE (several hours) often require only one dose per day. For example aminoglycosides and fluoroquinilones, exhibit a long PAE, particularly against gram negative bacteria.Time-dependent antibiotics tend to have minimal to no postantibiotic effect, whilst concentrationdependent antibiotics usually have a dose dependent long post antibiotic affectAntibioticAnti bacterial actionPharmacodynamic categoryFDA pregnancy risk categoryPenicillinBactericidalTime dependentBCephalosporinsBactericidalTime dependentBCarbapenemsBactericidalTime dependentB (Imipenem-C)MacrolidesBacteriostaticTime dependentB (clarithromycin-C)ClindamycinBacteriostaticTime dependentBTetracyclinsBacteriostaticTime dependentDAminoglycosidesBactericidalConcentration dependentDFloroquinolonesBactericidalConcentration dependentCGlycopeptidesBactericidalTime dependentCMetronidazoleBactericidalConcentration dependentB",

ANTIBIOTICMECHANISM OF ACTIONAminoglycosides* Inhibit protein synthesis by binding to a portion of the bacterial ribosome.

This includes penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems and monobactams.Cephalosporins* Similar to penicillins in their mode of action but they treat a broader range of bacterial infections. They have structural similarities to penicillins and many people with allergies to penicillins also have allergic reactions to cephalosporins.Chloramphenicol* Inhibits protein synthesis by binding to a subunit of bacterial ribosomes (50S).Glycopeptides (e.g., vancomycin)* Interferes with cell wall development by blocking the attachment of new cell wall subunits (muramyl pentapeptides).Macrolides (e.g., erythromycin) and Lincosamides (e.g., clindamycin)* inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. It combines with 50S ribosome subunits and interferes with 'translocation'.Penicillins* Inhibits formation of the bacterial cell wall by blocking cross-linking of the cell wall structure.

Ganciclovir (valganciclovir) is beneficial when prophylaxis is indicated and for the Rx of serious CMV disease. Acyclovir (Valacyclovir) is less efficacious but also less toxic than ganciclovir (Valganciclovir). The availability of Valganciclovir and Valacyclovir has allowed most centers to move to oral prophylaxis for transplant recipients. Additional oral prophylactic agents, such as maribavir, are in clinical study\".# Ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscamet, and cidofovir are approved for Rx of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS. They are also used for colitis, pneumonia, or \"wasting\" syndrome associated with CMV and for prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients.GANCICLOVIR AND VALGANCICLOVIR# An analogue of acyclovir. ganciclovir is active against HSV and VZV and is markedly more active than acyclovir against CMV.# Ganciclovir is a synthetic nucleoside analogue of 2?-deoxyguanosine. The drug is preferentially phosphorylated by virus-induced cellular kinases.# Ganciclovir triphosphate acts as a competitive inhibitor of the CMV DNA polymerase, and its incorporation into nascent viral DNA results in premature chain termination.# In HSV- and VZV-infected cells, ganciclovir is phosphorylated by virus-encoded thymidine kinases; in CMV-infected cells, it is phosphorylated by a viral kinase encoded by the UL97 gene.# Ganciclovir is approved for the Rx of CMV retinitis in immunosuppressed patients and for the prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients. It is widely used for the Rx of other CMV-associated syndromes, including pneumonia, esophagoGI infections, hepatitis, and \"wasting\" illness.# Oral ganciclovir has largely been supplanted by valganciclovir, which is the L-valyl ester of ganciclovir & is frequently used in place of IV ganciclovir.- Intraocular ganciclovir, given by either intravitreal injection or intraocular implantation, has also been used to treat CMV retinitis.# Valganciclovir is well absorbed orally, with a bioavailability of 60%, and is rapidly hydrolyzed to ganciclovir in the intestine and liver. The area under the curve for a 900-mg dose of valganciclovir is equivalent to that for 5 mg/kg of ganciclovir given IV, although peak serum concentrations are -40% lower for valganciclovir. The serum half-life is 3.5 h after IV administration of ganciclovir and 4.0 h after PO administration of valganciclovir.# Valganciclovir is an orally bioavailability prodrug that can generate high serum levels of ganciclovir, although studies of its efficacy in treating CMV CNS infections are limited.Foscarnet# is a pyrophosphate analogue that inhibits viral DNA polymerases by binding to the pyrophosphate-binding site.# Foscarnet is poorly soluble and must be administered IV via an in- fusion pump in a dilute solution over 1-2 h.# Foscarnet is approved for the Rx of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS and of acvclovir-resistant mucocutaneous HSV infections. Intraocular foscamet has been used to treat CMV retinitis.# Foscarnet has also been employed to treat acyclovir-resistant HSV and VZV infections as well as ganciclovir- resistant CMV infections, although resistance to foscarnet has been reported in CMV isolates obtained during therapy. Foscarnet has also been used to treat HHV-6 infections in immunosuppressed patients.# The major form of toxicity associated with foscamet is renal impairment. Thus renal function should be monitored closely, particularly during the initial phase of therapy.# Since foscarnet binds divalent metal ions, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hypo- or hyperphosphatemia can develop. Saline hydration and slow infusion appear to protect the patient against nephrotoxicity and electrolyte disturbances.# Foscarnet is not myelosuppressive and is active against acyclovir- and ganciclovir-resistant herpesviruses.Cidofovir# Cidofovir is a phosphonate nucleotide analogue of cytosine.# Its major use is in CMV infections. particularly retinitis. but it is active against a broad range of herpes viruses. including HSV. human herpesvirus (HHV) type 6. HHV-8. and certain other DNA viruses such as polyomaviruses. papillomaviruses. adenoviruses. and poxviruses. including variola (smallpox) and vaccinia.# Cidofovir is usually active against foscarnet-resistant CMV. although cross-resistance to foscarnet as well as to ganciclovir has been described.# Cidofovir has poor oral availability and is administered IV. It is excreted primarily by the kidney and has a plasma half- life of 2.6 h.# The major toxic effect of cidofovir is proximal renal tubular injury, as manifested by elevated se- rum creatinine levels and proteinuria. The risk of nephrotoxicity can be reduced by vigorous saline hydration and by concomitant oral probenecid. Neutropenia, rashes, and GI intolerance may also occur.# IV cidofovir has been approved for the Rx of CMV retinitis in AIDS patients who are intolerant of ganciclovir or foscarnet or in whom those drugs have failed.AMCICLOVIR AND PENCICLOVIR# Famciclovir is the diacetyl 6-deoxyester of the guanosine analogue penciclovir.# Famciclovir is well absorbed orally, has a bioavailability of 77%, and is rapidly converted to penciclovir by deacetylation and oxidation in the intestine and liver.# Penciclovir's spectrum of activity and mechanism of action are similar to those of acyclovir. Thus, penciclovir is usually not active against acyclovir-resistant viruses.# Famciclovir is effective as therapy for mucocutaneous HSV infections in HIV-infected patients.Ribavirin (Intravenous)# (15-25 mg/kg per day in divided doses given every 8 h) has been reported to be of benefit in isolated cases of severe encephalitis due to California encephalitis (LaCrosse) virus.# Ribavirin might be of benefit for the rare patients, typically infants or young children, with severe adenovirus or rotavirus encephalitis and in patients with encephalitis due to LCMV or other arenaviruses.# However, clinical trials are lacking. Hemolysis, with resulting anemia, has been the major side effect limiting therapy.TRIFLURIDINE# Trifluridine is a pyrimidine nucleoside active against HSV-1, HSV-2, and CMV.VIDARABINE# Vidarabine is a purine nucleoside analogue with activity against HSV- 1, HSV-2, VZV, and EBV.# Vidarabine inhibits viral DNA synthesis through its 5?-triphosphorylated metabolite.# IV-administered vidarabine has been shown to be effective in the Rx of herpes simplex encephalitis, mucocutaneous HSV infections, herpes zoster in immunocompromised patients, and neonatal HSV infections. Its use has been supplanted by that of IV acyclovir, which is more effective and easier to administer.",

It combines with SOS ribosome subunits and interferes with 'translocation'\"Erythromycin:# It is bacteriostatic at low but cidal at high concentration.# It is several fold more active in alkaline medium, because the non-ionized form of the drug is favored at higher pH.# MOA:- Erythromycin acts by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. It combines with 50S ribosome subunits and interferes with 'translocation'. After peptide bond formation between newly attacjed amino acid and the nacent peptide chain at the acceptor (A) site the elongated peptide is translocated back to peptidyl (P) site, making the A site available for next aminoacyl tRNA attachment. This is prevented by erythromycxin and the ribosomes fail to move along the mRNA to expose the next codon.# Spectrum:- Narrow- Includes mostly gram + and few gram negative bacteria, and overlaps considerably with that of penicillin G.- Highly active against Str. Pyogenes and Str. Pneumoniae, N.gonorrhoea, Clostredia, C. diphtheriae, Listeria.- Most penicillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococci have now become resistant to erythromycin.- Campylobacter, Legionella, Branhamella cataralis, Gadnerella vaginalis and mycoplasma are highly sensitive to erythromycin.# Pharmacokinetics:- 70-80% plasma protein bound, partly metabolized, and excreted primarily in bile in active form.- Renal excretion is minor.- Dose need not be altered in renal failure.# Interaction:- Inhibits hepatic oxidation of many drugs.- Causes rise in plasma levels of theophylline, carbamazepine, valproate, ergotamine, and warfarin.- Cases of QT prolongation, serious V'tachs and death reported due to CYP3A4 inhibition by erythromycin/ clarithromycin resulting in high bloofd levels of concurrently administered terfenadine, astemizole or cisapride.",

Hence, if they are prescribed they are usually coprescribed with clindamycin which inhibits bacterial protein toxin production.Other treatment options are a combination of vancomycin and clindamycin for suspected serious staphylococcal infections pending culture and sensitivity.Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; which presumably acts in part via neutralizing antibodies against toxins) has been used and appears to have significant promise. At present, IVIG is used in severe or recalcitrant cases.Treatment of choice:Vancomycin (15 mg/kg q12h) plus Clindamycin (600 mg q8h).If a penicillin or oxacillin-sensitive strain is isolated, o Penicillin or Oxacillin can be given.In severe cases:IV immunoglobulins.",

        "exp": "Ans. a (Sulphacetamide). (Ref. Harrison's Medicine 18th/ Chapter 144., KDT 6th/682).........Sulphacetamide eye drops used for ophthalmic neonatorum.The SULFONAMIDES may be classified into 3 groups on the basis of the rapidity with which they are absorbed and excreted: (1) agents that are absorbed and excreted rapidly, such as sulfisoxazole and sulfadiazine: (2) agents that are absorbed very poorly when administered orally and are active in the bowel lumen, such as sulfasalazine: (3) agents that are used topically, such as sulfacetamide, mafenide. and silver sulfadiazine: and (4) long-acting sulfonamides, such as sulfadoxine. that are absorbed rapidly but excreted slowly.SULFONAMIDESRapidly Absorbed And Eliminated SulfonamidesSulfisoxazole.Sulfamethoxazole.Sulfadiazine.Sulfisoxazole is a rapidly absorbed and excreted sulfonamide with excellent antibacterial activity.Since its high solubility eliminates much of the renal toxicity inherent in the use of older sulfonamides, it has essentially replaced the less-soluble agents.Sulfisoxazole is bound extensively to plasma proteins.Sulfisoxazole currently is preferred over other sulfona- mides by when a rapidly absorbed and rapidly excreted sulfonamide is indicated.Sulfamethoxazole is a close congener of sulfisoxazole, but its rates of enteric absorption and urinary excretion are slower.It is administered orally and employed for both systemic and urinary tract infections.Precautions must be observed to avoid sulfamethoxazole crystalluria.The uses of sulfamethoxazole are the same as sulfisoxazole.Sulfadiazine given orally is absorbed rapidly from the GI tract, and peak blood concentrations are reached within 3 to 6 hours after a single dose.About 15% to 40% of the excreted sulfadiazine is in acetylated form. In adults and children who are being treated with sulfadiazine, every precaution must be taken to ensure fluid intake adequate to produce a urine output of at least 1200 ml in adults.Poorly Absorbed Sulfonamides.Sulfasalazine is very poorly absorbed from the Gl tract.It is used in the therapy of ulcerative colitis and regional enteritis, but relapses tend to occur in about one-third of patients who experience a satisfactory initial response.Corticosteroids are more effective in treating acute attacks, but sulfasalazine is preferred to corticosteroids for the treatment of patients who are mildly or moderately ill with ulcerative colitis. The drug also is being employed as the first approach to treatment of relatively mild cases of regional enteritis and granulomatous colitis. Sulfasalazine is broken down by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine, an active sulfonamide that is absorbed and eventually excreted in the urine, and 5-aminosalicylate, which reaches high levels in the feces. 5-Aminosalicylate is the effective agent in inflammatory bowel disease, whereas sulfapyridine is responsible for most of the toxicity. Toxic reactions includeHeinz-body anemia, acute hemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and agranulocytosis. Nausea, fever, arthralgias, and rashes occur in up to 20% of patients treated with the drug; desensitizationhas been an effective treatment. Sulfasalazine can cause a reversible infertility in males owing to changes in sperm number and morphology.Long-Acting Sulfonamides.SulfadoxineIt has a particularly long half-life (7 to 9 days).It is used in combination with pyrimethamine for the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria caused by mefloquine - resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum.Because of severe and sometimes fatal reactions, including the Stevens-Johnson syndrome, the drug should be used for prophylaxis only where the risk of resistant malaria is high.Sulfonamides for Topical Use.Sulfacetamide.Solutions of the sodium salt of the drug are employed extensively in the management of ophthalmic infections.Although topical sulfonamide for most purposes is discouraged, its advantage is it penetrates into ocular fluids and tissues in high concentration. Sensitivity reactions to sulfacetamide are rare, but the drug should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides.Silver sulfadiazine inhibits the growth in vitro of nearly all pathogenic bacteria and fungi, including some species resistant to sulfonamides.The compound is used topically to reduce microbial colonization and the incidence of infections of wounds from burns.It should not be used to treat an established deep infection.Adverse reactions burning, rash, and itching are infrequentMafenide.When applied topically, it is effective for the prevention of colonization of burns by a large variety of gram-negative and grampositive bacteria. It should not be used in deep infection. Superinfection with Candida may be problem. Mafenide is rapidly absorbed systemically and converted to poro-carboxybenzenesulfonamide.Adverse effects include intense pain at sites of application, allergic reactions, and loss of fluid by evaporation from the burn surface because occlusive dressings are not used.Metabolic acidosis with compensatory tachypnea and hyperventilation may ensue; these effects limit its usefulness.",

KatzungRifampin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of mycobacteria and other microorganisms by forming a stable drug-enzyme complex, leading to suppression of initiation of chain formation (but not chain elongation) in RNA synthesis. More specifically, the b subunit of this complex enzyme is the site of action of the drug, although rifampin binds only to the holoenzyme. Nuclear RNA polymerases from a variety of eukaryotic cells do not bind rifampin, and RNA synthesis is correspondingly unaffected in eukaryotic cells. High concentrations of rifamycin antibiotics can inhibit RNA synthesis in mammalian mitochondria, viral DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and reverse transcriptases. Rifampin is bactericidal for both intracellular and extracellular microorganisms.A primary action of isoniazid is to inhibit the biosynthesis acids, branched lipids that are attached to a unique polysaccharide, arabino galactan, to form part of the mycobacterial cell wall.* Adjustment of dosageof rifampicin is not necessary in patients with impaired renal function.* It readily penetrates most tissues and into phagocytic cells. So they get concentrated mainly in lymphocytes and macrophages and not in neutrophils It can kill organisms that are poorly accessible to many other drugs, such as intracellular organisms and those that are sequestrated in abscesses and lung cavities.* Rifampicin, anticonvulsants including phenobarbitone, glucocorticoids induce CYP3 A soenzymes.

In HIV infected patients with refractory, sight- threatening CMV retinitis, fomivirsen injections significantly delay retinitis progression.Ocular side effects include iritis in up to 25% of patients, which can be managed with topical glucocorticoids, vitritis, cataracts, and increased intraocular pressure in 15-20% of patients. Recent cidofovir use may increase the risk of inflammatory reactions.Notes on antiviral therapyIntravenous acyclovir is the treatment of choice for herpes simplex encephalitis, neonatal HSV infection, and serious HSV or VZV infectionsPalivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope in the A antigen site on the F surface protein of RSV. It is licensed for the prevention of RSV infection in high-risk infants and children such as premature infants and those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease.Intravenous foscamet is used for CMV retinitis, including ganciclovir-resistant infections, other types of CMV infection, and acyclovir-resistant HSV and VZV infections. Foscamet's major dose-limiting toxicides are nephrotoxicity and hypocalcemia.The neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir, analogs of sialic acid, interfere with release of progeny influenza virus from infected to new host cells, thus halting the spread of infection within the respiratory tract. Unlike amantadine and rimantadine, zanamivir and oseltamivir have activity against both influenza A and influenza B viruses.",
