If a person still takes alcohol while on disulfiram treatment, alcohol is metabolized as usual, but acetaldehyde accumulates.* This accumulation of acetaldehyde gives some distressing symptoms like flushing, burning sensation, throbbing headache, perspiration, dizziness, vomiting, confusion and circulatory collapse.* Therefore, it is recommended only for those alcoholics who are motivated and sincerely desire to leave the habit.* Drugs causing Disulfiram like reaction:# Metronidazole# Chlorpropamide# Cefoperazone# Cefotetan# Trimethorprim* Other drugs that decrease craving for alcohol and smoking: (remembered as NATO)# NALTREXONE# ACAMPROSATE# TOPIRAMATE# ONDANSETRONAlso Know* Drug which inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase - FOMEPIZOLE* Antidote for methanol poisoning: FOMEPIZOLE > ETHANOL* Antidote for ethelene glycol poisoning: FOMEPIZOLE",

Though H+ is secreted at this site by H+-ATPase, it is generated in the cell by CAse mediated reaction. As such, this is a subsidiary site of action of CAse inhibitors,o For the same degree of natriuresis CAse inhibitors cause most marked kaliuresis compared to other diuretics.Read belowCollecting tubule is the most important site of K+ secretion by the kidney.K+ secretion occurs in exchange with Na+If Na+ load is higher in collecting tubels it will be absorbed in exchange with K+ and more K+ will be secreted, i.e. higher the Na+ load in CD, higher will be K+ excretion in urine.Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors act on proximal tubules, where maximum Na+ (70%) is absorbed -they block this absorption and will cause maximum kaliuresis (K+ excretion in urine).o Extrarenal actions of acetazolamideLowering of IOT due to decreased formation of aqueous humour.Decreased gastric HCL and pancreatic NaHCO3 secretion.Raised level of CO2 in brain and lowering of pH - sedation and elevation of seizure threshold.Alteration of CO2 trasport in lungs and tissues,o Uses of CAse inhibitors* Glaucoma# Acute mountain sickness# Periodic paralysis* Epilepsy# To alkalinise urine for UTI or to promote excretion of acidic drugso Dorazolamide and brinzolamide are used topically for glaucoma.o Adverse effectsHypersensitivity reactions in patients sensitive to sulfonamides (CAse inhibitors are sulfonamide derivatives).Bone marrow depression, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, drowsiness, paresthesias, fatigue and abdominal discomfort.In hepatic diseases may precipitate hepatic coma by interfering with urinary elimination of NH3.o Contraindications for carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.COPD # Hepatic cirrhosis # Hyperchloremic acidosiso Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide) can cause allergic reactions in patients hypersensitive to sulfonamides.",

They are xenobiotics.They are eliminated from the body mainly through kidney.Drug metabolism means necessary changes in the drug molecule which are essential for easy excretion from the body.Drug metabolism usually converts lipophilic chemical compounds into more readily excreted polar / water soluble / ionizable compounds.When the drug turns polar it becomes more soluble in the extracellular fluid and thus more filterable in the renal tubules. The drug also becomes highly ionizable so it is less reabsorbale and hence readily excretable from the kidney.The metabolism occcurs more or less in every tissue but mainly in the liver.Usually the drug metabolism occurs in two phases -Phase I andPhase IIPhase I and phase II reactions are biotransformations of chemicals that occur during drug metabolism.Phase I reactionsPhase I reactions usually precede phase II reactions though not necessarily. During these reactions, polar molecules are either added or unmasked, which results in more polar metabolites of the original chemicals. These metabolites are more water soluble than the original compound.Phase I reactions can lead to either activation or inactivation of the drug.Phase I reactions are usually of the following types:OxidationReductionHydrolysisCyclizationDecyclizationIf the metabolites of phase I reactions are sufficiently polar they may be readily excreted at this point.However many phase I products are not eliminated rapidly and undergo a subsequent reaction in which an endogenous substrate combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly polar conjugate (Phase II reaction).Phase II reactionsPhase II reactions are usually known as \"conjugation reactions\".This involves conjugation with glucuronic acid, sulfonates and glutathione.The phase II reactions are -MethylationSulfationAcetylationGlucuronidationThe products of conjugation have increased molecular weight and are usually inactive unlike phase I reactions which often produce active metabolites.",

Cytochrome b5 (cyb5) can also contribute reducing power to this system after being reduced by cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R).Mitochondrial P450 systems, that employ adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin to transfer electrons from NADPH to P450.Bacterial P450 systems, that employ a ferredoxin reductase and a ferredoxin to transfer electrons to P450.CYB5R/cyb5/P450 systems in which both electrons required by the CYP come from cytochrome b5.FMN/Fd/P450 systems originally found in Rhodococcus sp. in which a FMN-domain- containing reductase is fused to the CYP.P450 only systems, which do not require external reducing power.

Butorphanol has shown greater analgesia in women.Another alternative to parenteral administration is the buccal transmucosal route, which uses a fentanyl citrate lozenge or a \"lollipop'' mounted on a stick.",
