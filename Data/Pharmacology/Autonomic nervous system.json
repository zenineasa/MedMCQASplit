The i.o.t.remains normal until an attack is precipitated, usually by mydriasis. The i.o.t. rises rapidly to very high values (40-60 mmHg). It is an emergent condition with marked congestion of eyes and severe headache. Treatment:- 1. Hypeonic mannitol (20%) 1.5-2 g/kg or glycerol (10%): infused i.v. decongest the eye by osmotic action. 2. Acetazolamide:- 0.5 g i.v. followed by oral twice daily is staed concurrently. 3. Miotic:- Once the i.o.t. stas falling due to the above i.v. therapy, pilocarpine 1-4% is instilled every 10 min initially and then at longer intervals. Contraction of sphincter pupillae changes the direction of forces in the iris tolessen its contact with the lens and spreads the iris mass centrally - pupillary block is removed and iridocorneal angle is freed. 4. Topical b blocker:- Timolol 0.5% is instilled 12 hourly in addition. 5. Apraclonidine (1%)/latanoprost 0.005% instillation may be added.

It blocks sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction and produces fall in BP which is attended by only mild tachycardia; Prazosin dilates aerioles more than veins. Postural hypotension is less marked, occurs especially in the beginning, which may cause dizziness and fainting as 'first dose effect'. This can be minimized by staing with a low dose and taking it at bedtime. Subsequently tolerance develops to this side effect. uses:- Prazosin is primarily used as an antihypertensive. Other uses are--Raynaud's disease and benign hyperophy of prostate (BHP). Prazosin blocks a1 receptors in bladder trigone and prostatic smooth muscle, thereby improves urine flow, reduces residual urine in bladder. Ref:- kd tripathi; pg num:-140,142",

They compete with ACh at the receptor without stimulating it. Thus, these drugs prevent depolarization of the muscle cell membrane and inhibit muscular contraction. At high doses (Atypical doses) Non depolarising agents can also block the ion channels of the motor endplate Their competitive action can be overcome by administration of cholinestrase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and edrophonium, which increase the concentration of ACh in the neuromuscular junction At high doses with blockage of ion channels the abiility of ACh-esterase inhibitors to reverse the action is significantly reduced. At low doses, the muscle will respond to direct electrical stimulation from a peripheral nerve stimulator to varying degrees.
