Binding of RANK-ligand to these receptors causes differentiation and activation of osteoclast progenitors to mature osteoclasts. Donesumab is a monoclonal antibody that prevents the binding of RANK-ligand with RANK. This prevents activation of osteoclasts and it can therefore, be used in osteoporosis.Osteoblasts synthesize and release osteoprotegerin (OPG), identical with RANK, which functions as a 'decoy receptor'. OPG, thus inhibits the binding to RANK-L to RANK. Hence OPG analogs can be the potential therapeutic agents of osteoporosis.",
