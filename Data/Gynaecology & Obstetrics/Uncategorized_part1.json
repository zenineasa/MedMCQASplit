        "question": "Most sensitive diagnosis test for ectopic pregnancy",
        "exp": "Transvaginal ultrasound Diagnosis of Ectopic pregnancy Pregnancy is definitely diagnosed by demonstrating intrauterine sac. - A normal intrauterine sac appears regular and well defined on ultrasound. So ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed by demonstrating the absence of the intrauterine sac. In a woman in whom ectopic pregnancy is suspected because of pain, bleeding and positive pregnancy test, performance of vaginal sonography is the logical first step. If the sonography demonstrates live intrauterine fetus then ectopic pregnancy is extremely unlikely. Alternatively if the uterus is empty, an ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed based on the visualization of an adnexal mass separate from the ovaries. 3-hCG hormones also play an impoant role in the diagnosis of pregnancy. fi HCG is a hormone secreted during pregnancy. It is positive in viually 100% of ectopic pregnancies. However, a positive test only confirms pregnancy and does not indicate whether it is intrauterine or extrauterine. In normal pregnancy pHCG should double up every 2 days but in ectopic pregnancy the rate of increase of fl hCG is slow. 13 hCG litres and ultrasound complement one another in detecting ectopic pregnancy and have led to earlier detection. By correlating fl hCG titres with ultrasound .findings an ectopic pregnancy can often be differentiated.from intrauterine pregnancy. An intrauterine sac should be visible by transvaginal ultrasound when the p hCG is approximately 1000 ml p/m1 and by transabdominal ultrasound approximately 1 week later when the fi hCG is 1800-3600 ?nip/int. Thus when an empty uterine cavity is seen with a 13 hCG litre above this threshold, the patient is likely to have an ectopic pregnancy. An empty cavity is less of a concern when a fihCG below this threshold is obtained. Serum progesterone measuremen A single measurement of serum progesterone may sometimes clarify the diagnosis when ectopic pregnancy is suspected, but Its accuracy is crude and the customary thresholds are < 5 ng/m and > 25 'tend. i.e.a value exceeding 25 ng/m1 excludes ectopic pregnancy with 97.5% sensitivity, value below 5 ng/ml occur in only .3 percent of normal regnancies. So normal pregnancies can be excluded if the progesterone level is below 5%. Surgical diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy :- Laparoscopy Direct visualization of the ,fallopian tubes and pelvis by diagnostic laparoscopy offers a reliable diagnosis in most cases of suspected ectopic pregnancy and a ready transition to definitive operative therapy. At times, identification of an early unruptured tubal pregnancy may be difficult even if the tube is .fully visualized. Inspite of the low morbidity and quick recovery time, laparoscopy usually is performed when, on the basis of noninvasive test or curettage results, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is fairly ceain and medical therapy is not planned. In these cases laporoscopy is used both for therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. Laparotomy Open abdominal surgery is preferred when the woman is hemodynamically unstable or when laparoscopy is not feasible. Laparotomy should not be delayed while laparoscopy is performed in a woman with obvious abdominal hemorrhage that required immediate definitive treatment. Culdocentesis Culdocentesis is the transvaginal passage of a needle into the posterior cul-de-sac in order to determine whether free blood is present in the abdomen. This procedure is useful in the diagnosis of intraperitoneal bleeding. This procedure will reveal nonclotting blood if intra-abdominal bleeding has occurred. If culdocentesis is positive, laparoscopy or laparotomy should be performed immediately. Indeed, some argue that the main purpose of culdocentesis is, not in diagnosis but to better prioritize patients so that those with positive culdocentensis are taken immediately to the operating room. More on imaging procedures used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy Vaginal sonography There has been much improvement in the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy using vaginal sonography. Its use results in earlier and more specific diagnosis of uterine pregnancy than abdominal sonography and it has become the imaging method of choice in early pregnancy.

        "exp": "The central neurons system and its overlying bones are subject to a variety of malformations and developmental diseases. The defect described in the question stem is a cranial encephalocele, in which brain herniates through a defect in the skull bones. The most common site for such a herniation is the occipital bone. Small defects in the occipital bone can be treated surgically, but large defects are very problematic, paicularly if significant herniation has occurred, since the brain becomes very vulnerable to trauma and infection. Meningocele is the term used when the meninges, but not the brain or spinal cord, herniate through a defect in the bony cranium or spinal column. Myelocele is the term used when the spinal cord herniates through a defect in the spinal column. Spina bifida refers to veebral defects through which the spinal cord or meninges may herniate.

        "exp": "Ans. is b i.e. 32 weeks Friends, I had to search a lot for this answer but all in vain. Only Nelson Paediatric throws some light on this issue : \"Pulmonary surfactant is a heterogenous mixture of phospholipids and proteins secreted into the saccular or alveolar sub-phase by the type ll pneumocytes. Its presence is first recognised in characteristic secretory organelles known as lamellar bodies as early as the 24th week of gestation. However, surfactant lipids of which the most abundant is phosphatidyicholine, are not detectable in the amniotic fluid until the 30th week of gestation, suggesting that there is a chronologic gap between surfactant synthesis and secretion. Labour probably shoens this gap because phospholipids are consistently found in the air spaces of infants born before the 30th week of gestation.\" From the above lines it is clear : Surfactant synthesis occurs in 24th week of gestation, it appear in amniotic fluid in 30th week of gestation. Since 30 weeks is not given in options, I would personally go with 32 weeks, when surfactant will absolutely be detected in amniotic fluid, whereas at 28 weeks it can detected only if preterm labour occurs.",

The commonly repoed side effects are leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow aplasia, ulcerative stomatitis, hemorrhagic enteritis, elevated liver enzymes, alopecia, pneumonitis and diarrhea. It produces cranio-facial abnormalities in the fetus though it is not teratogenic. It is better to be avoided in women who are pregnant or in those who are planning for a pregnancy in the near future. Cyclosporine is a immunosuppressant that can be safely used in pregnancy.

As malaria is a life threatening infection in pregnancy, the benefits obtained outweighs the risks that evolve from the use of anti-malarials. Chloroquine is used both in the treatment and in the prevention of malaria in pregnancy. Pyrazinamide is used in the treatment of active tuberculosis in pregnant mothers. It is given along with isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol for a period of nine months.

        "question": "A pregnant female has past history of embolism in puerperium. What medical management she should take in next pregnancy to avoid this",
        "exp": "Ans. is b i.e. To take Warfarin after delivery Friends venous thromboembolism in pregnancy, is one of those topics which we donot study in detail during undergraduation. So, I am giving in brief, all the impoant points you need to remember : Venous thromboembolism in pregnnacy : Venous thromboembolism is the leading cause of maternal deaths in developed countries. Pregnancy increases the risk of thromboembolism 6 times as all components of virchow's triad are increased.deg A. Deep vein thrombosis : Left sided DVT is more common than Right sided DVT. Clinical features : swelling / redness / pain and calf muscle tenderness and oedema. Investigations - Recommended method during pregnancy : Doppler ultrasound - Gold standard (in conditions other than pregnancy) : venography Mangement : Therapeutic The treatment should be staed on clinical grounds if confirmatory tests are not available. Drug of choice - Heparin (as it doesnot cross the placenta) Initially intravenous Heparin is given with the aim to prolong APTT (activated paial thromboplastic time) by 1.5 to 2 times the control followed by subcutaneous Heparin. Monitoring is done by APTT and platelet count (as Heparin causes Thrombocytopenia). Oral anticoagulants like Warfarin cross the placenta and cause teratogenesis therefore should be avoided in pregnancy. Treatment is continued for 6 weeks following which prophylactic subcutaneous heparin is given throughout pregnancy. Heparin is stopped just before delivery. Regional anaesthesia should be avoided at the time of delivery in patients on heparin due to the risk of hematoma formation. Heparin is restaed about 6 - 8 hours after delivery as the puerperium is the time of greatest risk for VTE. Warfarin is commenced simultaneously and thereafter monitoring is done by prothrombin time (PT). Once the prothrombin time INR is between 2 and 3, heparin can be discontinued. Usually warfarin is continued for 6 to 18 weeks and is safe for breast feeding mothers. Thromboprophylaxis : Thromboprophylaxis is considered for women who are at increased risk of thromboembolism (TE). Risk category Risk factors High risk Recurrent TE Previous TE with thrombophilia Previous TE with family history TE in current pregnancy Low risk One episode of previous TE without thrombophiiia or family history Thrombophilia without previous thrombosis Additional risk Cesarean section, obesity, grand multiparity, age above 35, pre-eclampsia, prolonged immobilization etc. High risk patients need antepaum heparin, intrapaum heparin and postpaum prophylaxis for 6 weeks. Low risk patient require intrapaum and postpaum low dose prophylaxis for 6 weeks. Well, now that you have a detailed knowledge of thromboembolism, lets have a look at the question. It says : a female with previous history of embolism becomes pregnant,what medical management should be given to her? Option 'a. i.e. Compulsory prophylaxis with warfarin at 10 weeks. It is absolutely wrong as warfarin is not given during pregnancy. Option 'b Le to take warfarin after delivery - According to William obs. 22/e, p 1077 table 47-3, 23/e, p 1028 - table 47.6 In case of prior VTE associated with a non recurring risk factor and no known thrombophilia? During pregnancy : Only surveillance is required as per American college of chest physicians. Prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is required as per American college of obs & gynaecology (which also explains option 'd is paly correct). Postpaum : warfarin is given for 6 weeks. So, option 'b' is absolutely correct i.e. warfarin should be given in the post paum period for six weeks.",

It is usually confined to the T11-T12 dermatomes during the latent phase but eventually involves the TIO-LI dermatomes as the labour enters the the active phase. The visceral afferent fibres responsible for labour pain travel with sympathetic nerve.fibres.first to the uterine and cervical plexes then through the hypogastric and aoic plexes before entering the spinal cord with the T10-L1 nerve roots. The onset of perineal pain at the end of fist stage signals the beginning of the fetal descent and the second stage of labour. Stretching and compression of pelvic and perineal structures intensify the pain.

        "exp": "Ans. is a i.e. OCP Friends, all the options given in the question are used for treatment of PCOS but only OCP and spironolactone are used for managing hirsutism. The first step done in general practise in OPD's when a patient of PCOS comes is : Advise : Weight reduction. 'Weight reduction in obese patients is the initial recommendation because it reduces insulin, SHBG and androgen levels (mainly calculated or bioavailable testosterone) and may restore ovulation either alone or combined with ovulation induction agents.\" Drug therapy If a patient has hirsutism primary goal is lowering androgen levels to halt futher conversion of vellus hairs to terminal ones. Drugs used are : i. OCP's ? \"Combination OC's decrease adrenal and ovarian steroid production and reduce hair growth in nearly two - third of hirsute patients.\" \"Combined oral contraceptive - COC's are effective in establishing regular menses and lowering ovarian androgen production. As an additional effect, the estrogen component of these pills leads to increased SHBG levels. With higher SHBG levels, a greater amount of free testosterone is bound and thus becomes biologically unavailable at the hair follicle.\" Gonadotropin releasing horomone agonists - \"GnRH agonists effectively lower Gonadotropin levels over time, and in turn subsequently lower androgen levels. Despite their effectiveness in treating hirsutism, administration of these agents is not a preferred long term treatment method due to associated bone loss. high cost and menopausal side effects.\" iii Androgne receptor antagonists - like spirono lactone, cyproterone acetate and flut amide. These antiandrogens are competitive inhibitors of androgen binding to the androgen receptor. \"Although these agents are effective in the treatment of hirsutism, they carry a risk of several side effects. Metrorrhagia may frequently develop. In addition, as antiandrogens, these drugs bear a theoretical risk of pseudo hermaphroditism in male fetuses of women using such medication in early pregnancy. None of these antiandrogen agents are approved by the FDA for treatment of hyperandrogenism and thus are used off-label.\" iv. 5 a reductase inhibitor : Conversion of testosterone to dihydro testosterone can be decreased by 5 a reductase inhibitor, Finasteride. It is modestly effective in treating hirsutism and similar to other antiandrogens the risk of male fetus teratogenecity is present. So, friends after such a detailed discussion on the management of hirsutism. You can very well understand that the first line therapy for management of hirsutism are combined oral contraceptive pills.

The mass consists of a large (25 cm) cystic sac containing thick mucinous fluid within a thin wall. On careful inspection, the pathologist finds an area of increased thickness in the cyst wall, which is sampled for histology. Microscopically, the tumor appears to be composed mostly of a single layer of nonciliated columnar cells arranged in papillary projections. The thickened area, however, displays stratification of epithelial cells, increased cytologic atypia, and high mitotic activity. Neveheless, no stromal invasion is found. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Classification of ovarian tumors, like testicular tumors, is based on putative cell of origin. Thus, ovarian tumors can be divided into neoplasms of germ cells,surface epithelium, or stromal origin. Two thirds of all ovarian neoplasms derive from the surface (coelomic) epithelium. These cystic tumors may contain clear serous fluid or turbid mucinous fluid. Depending on whether a tumor is benign or malignant, surface epithelium tumors can be differentiated into serous cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma, and mucinous cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. Borderline tumors are intermediate cases in which the epithelial lining shows malignant features (cytologic atypia and architectural disorganization) in the absence of stromal invasion. Thus, microscopic features of the ovarian tumor in this case are consistent with a borderline mucinous tumor. Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma shows obvious signs of malignancy, including foci of invasion of the stroma within the cystic wall. Mucinous cystadenoma is a cystic tumor with a mucin-rich fluid content. The epithelial lining is similar to intestinal or cervical epithelium, ie, a single layer of columnar cells with apical mucin and no cilia. Serous cystadenocarcinoma is the most frequent malignant ovarian tumor. Its epithelial lining is composed of columnar cells showing atypia and crowding. By definition, stromal invasion is present.

They are the most common ovarian malignancy detected during pregnancy. Histologically as in seminoma, it mimics the pattern of primitive gonad, lymphocytic infiltration may be seen (good prognostic sign).deg Clinically as with all germ cell tumours most dysgerminoma are diagnosed at an early stage. Unlike other germ cell tumours it does not secrete AFP and HCG is only rarely secreted, however it secretes LDH and placental alkaline phosphate, which are used as tumour marker of dysgerminoma. Although dysgerminoma is most radio sensitive tumouty2treatment of choice is surgery (unilateral salpingo oophorectomy) followed by Bleomycin, Etoposide and Cisplatin (BEP) based chemotherapy as feility can be preserved.

Individuals who inherit mutations of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are highly susceptible for the development of hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. The mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant. Lifetime risk of Ovarian Ca in individual with these mutation - 25% Lifetime risk of Breast Ca in individual with these mutation - 50% BRCA-1 - (20-40% life time risk of ovarian cancer). BRCA-2 - (10-20% life time risk of ovarian cancer). Men in these families have an increased risk of prostate cancer. Strategies for prevention of hereditary ovarian cancer Genetic testing for susceptibility to ovarian cancer is rapidly becoming integrated into the clinical practice of oncology. Strategies have been adopted to reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer in patient with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations. Prophylactic oophorectomy : \"The only proven way to prevent ovarian cancer is surgical oopherectomy. As another possible site of disease among these high risk patients is fallopian tube therefore should be removed. IN BRCA 1 or BRCA-2 mutation carriers, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (B50) may be performed on either completion of childbearing or at age 35. In these patients, the procedure is approximately 90% effective in preventing epithelial ovarian cancer. In women with HNPCC, the risk reduction approaches 100%.\" Additional benefit of prophylactic oopherectomy is that the risk of breast cancer is reduced by 50-80%. Oral contraceptive pills : Data received from a multicenter control of genetic screening centers indicates that the use of oralcontraceptive pill is associated with 50% decreased risk for developing ovarian cancer in women who have mutation in either in BRCA - 1 or BRCA - 2. However there is sho term increased risk of developing breastcancer. Role of screening with CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound : \"In BRCA1- BRCA2 mutation carriers who donot wish to undergo prophylactic surgery a combination of through pelvic examination, transvaginal sonographic examination and CA 125 blood testing should be done\".

The incidence of multiple pregnancies is approximately 10%. Although clomiphene is effective in inducing ovulation in perhaps 75% of women, successful pregnancy ensues in only 40-50% of those who ovulate. Clomiphene also may be used to evaluate the male reproductive system because testosterone feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary is mediated to a large degree by estrogens formed from aromatization of the androgen. Enclomiphene is a more potent anti-oestrogenic isomer and the one primarily responsible for the ovulation-inducing actions of clomiphene citrate. Intrauterine insemination and clomiphene citrate increase pregnancy rate 3 times as compared to placebo. Incidence of twin pregnancy following clomiphene citrate ovulation induction is 10%, while that of triplets is 1%. A randomized control study showed that use of clomiphene has improved sperm motility and percent of normal forms but has not established an increased feility. Indications of clomiphene: Ovulation induction To aid invitro feilization when given with gonadotrophins In oligozoospermia: it increases gonadotrophin secretion and promotes spermatogenesis and testosterone secretion Adverse effects of clomiphene: Polycystic ovaries Multiple pregnancy Hot flushes Gastric upset Increased risk of ovarian tumor",

Therapeutic : When the continuation of pregnancy endangers the life of woman or may cause serious injury to her physical or mental health. B. Eugenic : When there is risk of the child being born with serious physical or mental abnormalities. This may occur. If the pregnant woman in the first three months suffers from : -- German measles, (incidence of congenital defects 10 to 12%). -- Smallpox or chicken pox. -- Toxoplasmosis. -- Viral hepatitis. Any severe viral infection. If the pregnant woman is treated with drugs like thalidomide, coisone, aminopterin, antimitotic drugs, or if she consumes hallucinogens or antidepressants. Mother is treated by X-rays or radioisotopes. Insanity of the parents. Humanitarian : When pregnancy has been caused by rape.deg Social : When pregnancy has resulted from the failure of contraceptive methods in case of a marrieddeg woman, which is likely to cause serious injury to her mental health. When social or economic environment, actual or reasonably expected can injure the mother's health. Rules : Only a qualified registered medical practitionerdeg possessing prescribed experience can terminate pregnancy. Chief Medical Officer of the district is empowered to ceify that a doctor has the necessary training to do aboions. A medical practitioner can qualify if he has assisted in performance of twenty-five cases ofdeg M. TR in a recognised hospital.

Is No novemmental institutions may take up aboion if they obtain a licence from Chief Medical Officer of the district.deg The consent of the womandeg is required before conducting aboion. Written consent of the guardian is required if the woman is a minor (<18 years)degor a mentally ill person.deg Consent of husband is not necessary. Aboion cannot be performed on the request of the husband, if the woman herself is not willing. The woman need not produce proof of her age. The statement of the woman that she is over eighteen years of age is accepted. It is enough for the woman to state that she was raped, and it is not necessary that a complaint was lodged with the police. Professional secrecy has to be maintained.

Termination is permitted upto 20 weeks of pregnancy.deg In an emergency, pregnancy can be terminated by a single doctor, even without required training (even after twenty weeks). without consulting a second doctor, in a private hospital which is not recognised. The termination of pregnancy by a person who is not registered medical practitioner (person concerned), or in an unrecognised hospital (the administrative head) shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a terra which shall not be less than two years, but which may extend to seven years.",

In Rh hemolytic disease, there is excessive destruction of RBC's leading to anemia, tissue anoxemia and metabolic acidosis.

If the sonography demonstrates live intrauterine fetus then ectopic pregnancy is extremely unlikely.

However, a positive test only confirms pregnancy and does not indicate whether it is intrauterine or extrauterine. In normal pregnancy 13 HCG should double up every 2 hCG is slow. 13 hCG titres and ultrasound complement one another detection. By correlating 13 hCG titres with ultrasound from intrauterine pregnancy. days hut in ectopic pregnancy the rate of increase of fl in detecting ectopic pregnancy and have led to earlier findings an ectopic pregnancy can often be differentiated The discriminatory zone of fl HCG levels is the level above which a normal intrauterine pregnancy is visualized. The threshold of discrimination of intrauterine pregnancy today is around 1500 IU/ml of R HCG. A high resolution, vaginal ultrasound scan showing no intrauterine pregnancy is presumptive evidence that an ectopic pregnancy is present but may also be consistent with an intrauterine pregnancy which is too small to be seen on ultrasound. If the diagnosis is unceain, it is necessary to wait for few days and repeal the bHCG after 48 hrs. If the flHCG falls on repeat examination. - This suggests an aboion or rupture. If the fl HCG is not increasing at a normal rate i.e., > 66% in two days. - Ectopic pregnancy is diagnosed. In the question the 13 HCG level is 1000. Absence of gestational sac at this 13 HCG level does not fully confirm ectopic pregnancy. 13 HCG level should be obtained after 48 hrs to confirm ectopic pregnancy (If the increase in 8 HCG is less compared to nonnal pregnancy the diagnosis is ectopic pregnancy). More on ectopic pregnancy Serum progesterone measurement A single measurement of serum progesterone may sometimes clarify the diagnosis when ectopic pregnancy is suspected, but Its accuracy is crude and the customary thresholds are < 5 nWm and > 25 ng/ml. i.e.a value exceeding 25 ng/ml excludes ectopic pregnancy with 97.5% sensitivity value below 5 ng/nil occur in only .3 percent normal regnancie.v. So normal pregnancies can be excluded if the progesterone level is below 5%. Surgical diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy :- Laparoscopy Direct visualization of the fallopian tubes and pelvis by diagnostic laparoscopy offers a reliable diagnosis in most cases of suspected ectopic pregnancy and a ready transition to definitive operative therapy. At times, identification of an early unruptured tubal pregnancy may be difficult even if the tube is fully visualized. Inspite of the low morbidity and quick recovery time, laparoscopy usually is performed when, on the basis of noninvasive test or curettage results, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is fairly ceain and medical therapy is not planned. In these cases laporoscopy is used both for therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. Laparotomy Open abdominal surgery is preferred when the woman is hemodynamically unstable or when laparoscopy is not feasible. Laparotomy should not be delayed while laparoscopy is performed in a woman with obvious abdominal hemorrhage that required immediate definitive treatment. Culdocentesis Culdocentesis is the transvaginal passage of a needle into the posterior cul-de-sac in order to determine whether free blood is present in the abdomen. This procedure is useful in the diagnosis of intraperitoneal bleeding. This procedure will reveal nonclotting blood if intra- abdominal bleeding has occurred. If culdocentesis is positive, laparoscopy or laparotomy should be performed immediately. Indeed, some argue that the main purpose of culdocentesis is, not in diagnosis but to better prioritize patients so that those with positive culdocentensis are taken immediately to the operating room. More on imaging procedures used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy Vaginal sonography There has been much improvement in the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy using vaginal sonography. Its use results in earlier and more specific diagnosis of uterine pregnancy than abdominal sonography and it has become the imaging method of choice in early pregnancy.

Inadequate progesterone secretion could be due to : Inadequate follicular development Inadequate FSH or LH secretion Hyperprolactinemia Diagnosis : The diagnosis of luteal phase defect can be done by : BBT Cha : slow rise of temperature taking 4 - 5 days following fall in the mid cycle. rise of temperature sustains less than 10 days. Endometrial biopsy: Biopsy done in post ovulatory period reveals endometrium at least 2 days out of phase. Serum progesteronedeg estimated on 5th day following ovulation is less than 10 ng/ml. Management : Adminstration of vaginal or intramuscular progesterone (50 - 100 mg/d) begining 3 days after documentation of an LH surge and continued till : - Either first day of next menstrual cycle.

        "exp": "Inhibins are produced by Seoli cells in males and by granulosa cells in females. Serum inhibin levels vary widely across the menstrual cycle. During the early follicular phase, FSH stimulates the secretion of inhibin B by the granulosa cells. However, increasing levels of circulating inhibin B blunt FSH secretion later in the follicular phase. A low level of inhibin B on day 3 may indicate a declining ovarian reserve which is helpful for assessing reproductive ageing and ovarian reserve. During the luteal phase, regulation of inhibin production comes under the control of LH and switches from inhibin B to inhibin A. Inhibin B levels peak during the midluteal phase, decrease with the loss of luteal function, and remain low during the luteal-follicular transition and early follicular phase. The inverse relationship between circulating inhibin levels and FSH secretion is consistent with a negative-feedback role for inhibin in regulating FSH secretion.

Initially there is a supraphysiological release of FSH and LH from pituitary (Flare) followed by decrease in the synthesis and release of both FSH and LH. Preparations of GnRH : * Buserelin * Leuprorelin Nafarelin * Gosserelin Triptorelin * Historelin Method of administration : Subcutaneous/intramuscular injections or as nasal sprays. Indications : In females : (In all those conditions where there is increased estrogen, GnRH analogues are useful). Mnemonic : A - F and HIP. A = Adenomyosis B = Irritable Bowel Syndrome (under Trial) C = Ca Breast (Tamoxifen + GnRH agonist give good result) D = DUB E = Endometriosis F = Fibromyoma uterus. H = Hirsutism I = Infeility P = Precocious Pubey. In males : Cryptorchidism : sho term intranasal nafarelin is used. Carcinoma prostrate : GnRH agonist are as effective as orchidectomy in Ca prostrate but if there are neurological symptoms or life threatening metastatic disease - androgens should first be staed followed by GnRH agonist. BPH : Daily administration of leuprorelin or nafarelin decreases obstructive urinary symptoms in 1-6 months time. Adverse effects of GnRH : Local allergic reaction may occur at injection site. They cause menopause like Symptoms -- Hot flushes, vaginal dryness, headache, joint and muscle stiffness, depression, osteoporosis and irregular vaginal bleeding. GnRH antagonist : Acts immediately to stop Gonadotropin secretion (without any flare) eg : Cetrirelix, Ganirelix, Nal-glu.

As far as candidial (monilial) vaginitis is concerned, OCP's use increase their incidence. But for Chlamydial infections : \"Persons who use barrier contraception are less frequently infected by C. Trachomatis than those who use no contraception, and women who use oral contraceptives may have a higher incidence of cervical infection than women not using oral contraceptives\". As if replying to CGDT \"Chlamydial colonization of the cervix appears more likely in OC users than in non users, but despite this. there is a 40-50% reduction in risk for Chlamydial PID\" I then had to confirm the answer from Clinical Gynaecologic Endocrinology and Infeility 7,/e by Leon Speroff (It is the most authentic and reliable book for all problems related to Endocrinology, Contraception and Infeility) \"Fifteen of the 17 published studies repoed a positive association of oral contraception with lower Genital tract infections caused by Chlamydial cervicitis. Because lower genital tract infection are on the rise (now the most prevalent STI in the US) and the rate of hospitalization for PID is also increased, it is wohwhile for both patients and clinicians to be ale for symptoms of cervicitis or salpingitis in women on oral contraceptives who are at high risk of sexually transmitted infections.\" As far as HPV infection i.e. Vaginal was is concerned 'The viral sexually transmitted infections (STI's) include HIV, Human papilloma virus (HPV), Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and hepatitis B (HBV). At the present time, no known associations exist between oral contraception and the viral STI'S' ... Leon Speroff 7/e, p 904 So, now we can be sure that the answer is Chlamydial endocervicitis. Also know : Infections and Oral contraception : Use of OCP is associated with Increased risk of infection - Candida (Moniliasis) - Gonorrheadeg - Viral STI's i.e. HIVdeg . HPVdeg - Chlamydia - Trichomonasdeg - Hepatitis B virus - Urinary tract infections - Bacterial vaginosis - Herpes simplex virus Note : If question says PID and does not specify any organism. Then OCP'S overall not only decrease the incidence of PID but also risk of hospitalisation and severity of the disease is decreased.
