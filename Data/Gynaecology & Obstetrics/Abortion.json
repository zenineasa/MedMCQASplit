The lack of development of fetal structures defines a subset of abortions of genetic origin.In contrast, the early interruption of fetal life is a complex phenomenon with multiple etiologies. Therefore, the patients with blighted ova do not require extensive work up, whereas patients who have aborted cytogenetically normal fetuses need an extensive search for non genetic factors responsible for the pregnancy loss.",

At investigation it may be found that the fetus remains viable and the pregnancy continues without further problems. It has been suggested that bed rest improves the chances of the pregnancy continuing when a small subchorionic hematoma has been found on ultrasound scans.Alternatively, the following terms are used to describe pregnancies that do not continue:An empty sac is a condition where the gestational sac develops normally, while the embryonic part of the pregnancy is either absent or stops growing very early. Other terms for this condition are blighted ovum and anembryonic pregnancy.An inevitable abortion describes where the cervix has already dilated open, but the fetus has yet to be expelled.
