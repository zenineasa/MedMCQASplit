Mammogenesis : Growth of both ductal and lobuloalveolar systems occurs in pregnancy2. Lactogenesis : Colostrum secretion is noted during pregnancy and immediately post delivery. Milk secretion starts around the third postpartum day. Despite high prolactin levels in pregnancy, milk is not secreted as the high levels of estrogen and progesterone make the breast tissue unresponsive. With withdrawal of estrogen and progesterone levels post delivery, prolactin acts on the breast tissue. Growth hormone, thyroxine and insulin also increase secretory activity.3. Galactokinesis: Milk is discharged due to the infant's suckling efforts and also a contractile mechanism which expresses milk from the alveoli into the ducts. Oxytocin is a major galactokinetic hormone.# Milk ejection reflex: Reflex by which milk is forced down into the ampulla of the lactiferous duct, where it can be sucked out by the baby.4. Galactopoeisis : The most important hormone is prolactin. Suckling is essential for effective and continuous lactation. Periodic feeding is essential to relieve the pressure which then maintains the secretion.",

        "question": "The production rate of the following hormone near term, is the greatest of any known hormone in humans (approximately IgM/day):",
        "exp": "Ans. D. HPLa. Human placenta lactogen (HPL) was named so, because of its potent lactogenic & growth hormone like bioactivity, as well as immunochemical resemblance to human growth hormone.b. It is detected as early as 2nd or 3rd week after fertilization.c. It is a single, non-glycosylated polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 22,279Da. It is derived from a 25,000Da precursor.d. Maternal plasma concentrations are linked to placental mass & they rise steadily till 34-36 weeks of gestation.e. The HPL production rate near term is by far the greatest of any known hormone in humans- approximately IgM/day.f. The half-life in maternal plasma is between 10 & 30 minutes. The functions of HPL are:i. It decreases maternal insulin sensitivity (increases insulin resistance) & ensures nutrient flow to the fetus.ii. It promotes maternal lipolysis with the release of free fatty acids. This provides an energy source for maternal metabolism & fetal nutrition.iii. It favors protein synthesis & provides a readily available amino acid source to the fetus.iv. Potent angiogenic hormone & may serve a function in fetal vasculature formation.",

        "question": "Maximum level of beta HCG is seen on which day of gestation?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., 9 weeks o Maximum levels of beta HCG occur on 66th day of pregnancy, i.e. 9 weeks 3 days.Human Chorionic Gonadotropino Produced almost exclusively in placenta, low levels in fetal kidneyo Molecular weight - 36000 - 40000 Da.o Highest carbohydrate content of any hormone - 30 percent.o It has a long half life - 36 hours as against only 2 hours of LH; as the carbohydrate component, and especially the terminal sialic acid, protects the molecule from catabolismo Alpha subunit of LH, FSH, TSH and HCG are structurally related to each other. Recombination of alpha and beta subunits of these four hormones gives a molecule with biological activity characteristic of the hormone from which the beta subunit was derivedo Principal form in plasma - Intact hCGo Principal form in urine - beta core fragment (terminal hCG degradation product).Functionsa) Maintainence of corpus luteum till 6 weeks of pregnancy.b) Stimulation of fetal testicular testosterone secretion which is maximum approximately when hCG levels peak. Thus at a critical time in male sexual differentiation, hCG enters fetal plasma from the syncytiotrophoblast. In the fetus, it acts as an LH surrogate to stimulate Leydig cell replication and testosterone synthesis to promote male sexual differentiation. Before approximately 110 days, there is no vascularization of the fetal anterior pituitary from the hypothalamus. Thus, pituitary LH secretion is minimal,and hCG acts as LH before this time. Thereafter as hCG levels fall, pituitary LH maintains modest testicular stimulation.c) Immunosuppressive activity, inhibits maternal processes of immunorejection of the fetus as a homograft.d) Stimulates maternal thyroid (thyrotropic action).e) Promotes relaxin secretion from corpus luteum.o Choriocarcinoma is associated with increased secretion of beta - hCG that is glycosylated to a greater degree, so called hyperglycosylated hCG, sometimes called invasive trophoblast antigen.",

        "question": "Lactiferous duct of breast contraction is due to:",
        "exp": "Ans. C. Oxytocin* Oxytocin primarily results in stimulation of two specific types of muscular contraction:* Uterine muscular contraction during parturition* Breast lactiferous duct myoepithelial contraction during milk let down reflex.A Brief on Breast Functional Anatomy* The areola is central, pigmented portion of breast with a diameter of about 2.5cm.* Accessory glands located around the periphery of the areola are Montgomery glands (they can secrete milk).* The nipple accommodates about 15-20 lactiferous ducts and their openings.* Each milk duct (lactiferous duct) dilates to form lactiferous sinus at about 5-10mm away from its opening in the nipple. Lactiferous sinus acts as reservoir of milk.* The lining epithelium of the duct near the opening is stratified squamous. Each alveolus is lined by columnar epithelium where milk secretion occurs.* Myoepithelial cells are the network of branching longitudinal striated cells which surround the alveoli and the smaller ducts. There is a dense network of capillaries surrounding the alveoli. These are situated between the basement membrane and epithelial lining.* Contraction of these cells (in response to oxytocin) squeezes the alveoli and ejects the milk into the larger duct",
