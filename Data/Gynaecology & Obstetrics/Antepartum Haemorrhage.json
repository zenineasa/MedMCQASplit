Her first pregnancy resulted in a vaginal delivery of a 9-lb, 8-oz baby boy after 30 min of pushing. On doing Leopold maneuvers during this office visit, you determine that the fetus is breech. Vaginal exam demonstrates that the cervix is 50% effaced and 1 to 2 cm dilated. The presenting breech is high out of the pelvis. The estimated fetal weight is about 7 lb. You send the patient for a sonogram, which confirms a fetus with a frank breech presentation. There is a normal amount of amniotic fluid present, and the head is well flexed. As the patient's obstetrician, you offer all the following possible management plans except",
        "exp": "The patient who has a fetus with a breech presentation has the option of scheduling an elective cesarean section at or after 39 weeks, or alternatively can elect to have a breech delivery if certain conditions are met. It is inappropriate to electively deliver any patient prior to 39 weeks without a documentation of fetal lung maturity because of the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, if a patient declines to undergo a vaginal breech delivery, an elective cesarean should be scheduled at or after 39 weeks gestational age to avoid this complication of preterm delivery. If a patient would like to avoid a cesarean section but does not want to undergo a vaginal breech delivery, then an external cephalic version is an appropriate management plan. An external cephalic version (ECV) is a procedure where the fetus with a breech presentation is manipulated through the abdominal wall to change the presenting part to vertex. Studies indicate that if an ECV is not performed, 80% of breech presentations will persist at term vs. only 30% if a successful version is performed. ECV has an average success rate of about 60%; it is most successful in parous women with an unengaged breech and a normal amount of amniotic fluid (all conditions that exist in the patient described). A trial of labor for a pregnant woman with a fetus in the breech presentation is appropriate if the fetus is frank breech, has a flexed head, has a normal amount of amniotic fluid, and has an estimated weight between 2500 and 3800 g. In addition, the pelvis should be adequate as assessed with x-ray pelvimetry or a history of delivery of a previous baby of bigger size.",

        "exp": "Nausea, fatigue, breast tenderness, and urinary frequency are all common symptoms of pregnancy, but their presence cannot definitively make the diagnosis of pregnancy because they are nonspecific symptoms that are not consistently found in early pregnancy. On physical exam, the pregnant uterus enlarges and becomes boggier and softer, but these changes are not usually apparent until after 6 weeks gestational age. In addition, other conditions such as adenomyosis, fibroids, or previous pregnancies can result in an enlarged uterus being palpated on physical exam. Abdominal ultrasound will not demonstrate a gestational sac until a gestational age of 5 to 6 weeks is reached. A Doppler instrument will detect fetal cardiac action usually no sooner than 10 weeks. A sensitive serum pregnancy test can detect placental HCG levels by 8 to 9 days post-ovulation, and it is therefore the most sensitive modality for detecting and diagnosing pregnancy.",

Her baseline blood pressures were 100-110/ 60-70, and she has gained a total of 20 lb so far. During the visit, the patient complains of bilateral pedal edema that sometimes causes her feet to ache at the end of the day. Her urine dip indicates trace protein, and her blood pressure in the office is currently 115/75. She denies any other symptoms or complaints. On physical exam, there is pitting edema of both legs without any calf tenderness. How should the obstetrician respond to the patient's concern?",
        "exp": "Increased fluid retention manifested by pitting edema of the ankles and legs is a normal finding in pregnancy. During pregnancy, there is a decrease in colloid osmotic pressure and a fall in plasma osmolality. Moreover, there is an increase in venous pressure created by partial occlusion of the vena cava by the gravid uterus, which also contributes to pedal edema. Diuretics are sometimes given to pregnant women who have chronic hypertension, but this is not the case in this patient. More commonly, Lasix is used in the acute setting to treat pulmonary edema. This patient is not hypertensive and does not have any other signs or symptoms of preeclampsia and therefore does not need to be admitted for a further workup. Trace protein in the urine is common in normal pregnancies and is not of concern. Doppler studies of the lower extremities are not indicated in this patient since the history and exam (specifically, the lack of calf tenderness) are consistent with physiologic edema.

She is disappointed because she is 41 weeks gestational age by good dates and a first-trimester ultrasound and wants to have her baby She feels like she has been pregnant forever and wants to have her baby now. The patient reports good fetal movement; she has been doing kick counts for the past several days and reports that the baby moves about eight times an hour on average. On physical exam, her cervix is firm, posterior, 50% effaced, and 1 cm dilated, and the vertex is at a -1 station. As her obstetrician, which of the following would you recommend to the patient?",
        "exp": "Post-term or prolonged pregnancies are those pregnancies that have gone beyond 42 completed weeks of gestation. In general, obstetricians do not allow pregnancies to persist after 42 weeks because of the significantly increased incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality. If a patient has a ripe cervix, it is reasonable to induce the patient at 41 weeks because the chance of having a successful vaginal delivery is very high. On the other hand, if the patient has an unripe cervix, it is generally recommended that she continue with the pregnancy. Alternatively, a patient can be induced at 41 weeks with an unripe cervix if cervical ripening agents are used. If a patient waits until 42 weeks and still has an unripe cervix, then admission with administration of cervical ripening agents prior to Pitocin induction is recommended to improve the likelihood of a successful vaginal delivery. The Bishop score is a way to determine the favorability of the cervix to induction. The elements of the Bishop score include effacement, dilation, station, consistency, and position of the cervix (see table). Induction to active labor is usually successful with a Bishop score of 9 or greater. In the scenario described here, the patient has a Bishop score of 4, which is unfavorable for induction. Therefore, expectant management is a reasonable management plan to try to give the cervix time to ripen to avoid a cesarean section. It is not recommended to perform an elective section without a trial of labor because of the risks of major surgery.Bishop ScoreDilationEffacementStationConsistencyPosition0Closed0-30%-3FirmPosterior11-2 cm40-50%-2MediumMid-position23-4 cm60-70%-1,0SoftAnterior3>=5 cm>=80%+1,+2--",
