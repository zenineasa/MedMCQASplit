Prevention of multiple sperm entry* Zona pellucida is a glycoprotein layer surrounding the membrane of oocytes.* Once sperms reach ova, there is release of hyaluronidase - penetration of corona radiata and cumulus cells by sperm.* Glycoproteins on the outer surface of the sperm then bind with glycoproteins on the zona pellucida of the ovum.* Zona reaction: Once sperm penetrates zona pellucida, the ovum become impermeable to other sperms, this prevents polyspermy.",
