        "exp": "Ans. B Asherman's syndrome Primary Amenorrhea is defined as: 1. In absence of secondary sexual characters No menses till the age of 14 years or 2. In presence of secondary sexual characters no menses till the age of 16 years. 3. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as absence of menses for 6 consecutive months (or length of time equivalent to total of 3 previous cycles) in a female who had previously regular menses. 4. MC cause of primary amenorrhea is ovarian dysgenesis/Turners syndrome. 5. Mullerian agenesis (Rokitansky Mayer Kustner Hauser/ R.M.K.H Syndrome) is the secondMC cause and Androgen insensitivity syndrome or Testicular feminizing syndrome (A.I.S./T.F.S) is the 3rd MC of primary amenorrhea . 6. Patients with classic Kallmann syndrome or idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may not experience puberty or may experience incomplete puberty and have symptoms associated with hypogonadism. 7. For men, these symptoms include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased muscle strength, and diminished aggressiveness and drive. 8. For women, symptoms include amenorrhea and dyspareuniA. Notably, patients with Kallmann syndrome or idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism do not experience hot flashes. 9. All patients with Kallmann syndrome have either anosmia or severe hyposmia and may exhibit symptoms of associated conditions including those of congenital heart disease (eg, fatigue, dyspnea, cyanosis, palpitations, syncope) or neurologic manifestations (eg, color blindness, hearing deficit, epilepsy, paraplegia). 10. Pregnancy in the MC cause of secondary amenorrhea 11. \"Asherman's Syndrome\" is a condition characterized by adhesions and/or fibrosis of the endometrium particularly but can also affect the myometrium. It is often associated with dilation and curettage of the intrauterine cavity. A number of other terms have been used to describe the condition and related conditions including: intrauterine adhesions (IUA), uterine/cervical atresia, traumatic uterine atrophy, sclerotic endometrium, endometrial sclerosis, and intrauterine synechiae",
