        "exp": "The lung maturity occurs at 34 weeks of gestation and this is ceified by checking the L:S ratio which should be > 2:1 or appearance of Phosphatidyl glycerol in the amniotic fluid. Maternal administration of coicosteroid is advocated where the pregnancy is less than 34 weeks. This helps in fetal lung maturation so that the incidence of RDS, Intra Ventricular Hemorrhage , Necrotising Enterocolitis , and Patent Ductus Aeriosus are minimized.
