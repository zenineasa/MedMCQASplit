Thus, adequate visualization of the entire cervical squamocolumnarjunction and upper limits of all lesions defines whether a colposcopic examination is termed satisfactory or unsatisfactory. This determination can affect management. Therefore, with initially unsatisfactory colposcopy, an endocervical speculum may be used to dilate and fully visualize lesions that have extended cephalad into the endocervical canal",

Invasion is limited to measured stromal invasion with a maximum depth of 5 mm and no wider than 7 mm.o Stage I At: Stage IAI: Measured invasion of the stroma no greater than 3 mm in depth and no wider than 7 mm diameter.o Stage IA2: Stage IA2; Measured invasion of stroma greater than 3 mm but no greater than 5 mm in depth and no wider than 7 mm in diameter.Stage IB: Stage IB: Clinical lesions confined to the cervix or preclinical lesions greater than Stage la. All gross lesions even with superficial invasion are Stage IB cancers.o Stage IB1: Stage IB 1: Clinical lesions no greater than 4 cm in size.o Stage IB2: Stage IB2: Clinical lesions greater than 4 cm in size.Stage IIStage II is carcinoma that extends beyond the cervix, but does not extend into the pelvic wall.The carcinoma involves the vagina, hut not as far as the lower third.Stage IIA: No obvious parametria] involvement. Involvement of up to the upper two-thirds of the vagina.Stage IAB: Obvious parametria! involvement, but not into the pelvic sidewall.Stage IIIStage III is carcinoma that has extended into the pelvic sidewall.On rectal examination, there is no cancer-free space between the tumour and the pelvic sidewall.The tumour involves the lower third of the vagina.All cases with hydronephrosis or a nonfunctioning kidney are Stage III cancers.Stage III A: No extension into the pelvic sidewall but involvement of the lower third of the vagina.Stage II IB: Extension into the pelvic sidewall or hydronephrosis or nonfunctioning kidney.Stage IVStage IV is carcinoma that has extended beyond the true pelvis or has clinically involved the mucosa of the bladder and/or rectum.Stage IVA: Spread of the tumour into adjacent pelvic organs.Stage IVB: Spread to distant organs.",
