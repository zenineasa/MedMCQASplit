Usually, the loop is cut and the ends cauterized or \"burned\".Uchida technique--Proximal end of resected tube is buried into the serous coat along the antimesentric border.Irving procedure--The proximal ends of the tube are buried into the posterior surface of uterus.Madlener technique--Loop of the tube is crushed with artery forceps and tied with black silk.Kroener method of fimbriectomy.laparoscopic method using rings, clips and electrocoagulation.",
