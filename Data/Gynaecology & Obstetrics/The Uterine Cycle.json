All the above o While zygote is passing down the fallopian tube and after a brief period as it enters the uterus,, it depends for its nutrition on the yolk sac granules (deutoplasm) embedded in its cytoplasm and on the fluid medium surrounding it which is secreted by the walls of the uterine tube and uterus. It also dervies its energy from the stored carbohydrates in sperm, which fertilized the ovum.",
