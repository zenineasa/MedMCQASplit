        "exp": "Enclomiphene is anti-estrogenic Clotnifene is structurally related to stilbestrol, It is a weak estrogen agonist having less activity than natural estrogens, so that its ocupation of receptors results in antagonism. Clomiphene acts as an antiestrogen. It has two isomers Zuclomiphene (cis clomiphene) Weak estrogen agonist - Enclomiphene (trans clomiphene) Potent antagonist of estrogen. Clomiphene binds to both the estrogen receptors ccand 13 It acts as pure estrogen antagonist in all human tissues. Antagonists of estrogen receptor are used to induce gonadotropin release in anovulatory feility. Normally estrogen exes negative feedback on the production of LH and FSH. - This .feedback effect seems to operate mainly on the anterior pituitary gland directly but they also operate on the hypothalamus to decrease secretion of GnRh. - Clomiphene blocks hypothalamic estrogen receptors so that the negative feedback of natural estrogens is prevented and the pituitary responds by increased secretion of gonadotropin. In response to increased LH/FSH, ovaries enlarge and ovulation occurs. This is the basis for clomiphene's major pharmacological use? To induce ovulation in women with a functional hypothalamic-hypophyseal ovarian system and adequate endogenous estrogen production. Clinical use of Clomiphene Treatment of disorders of ovulation. Usually a single ovulation is induced by a single course of therapy, and the patient must be treated repeatedly untily the pregnancy is achieved, since normal ovulatory function does not usually resume. The drug is of no value in patients with ovarian or pitutary failure. Oligospermia -- Clomiphene increases gonadotropin secretion in men also and promotes spermatogenesis. Thus it is prescribed even for male infeility. Adverse effects Hot flushes due to estrogen blocks. Polycystic ovaries Multiple pregnancy (incidence is 6-10%), Increased risk of ovarian tumor. The answer is still not clear. Let see each option one by one. Option 'a' (i.e.,Enclomiphene is anti-estrogenic) There is no doubt regarding this one. - Enclomiphene is an anti-estrogen. Option 'lb' (i.e.,Pregnancy rate is 3 times as compared to placebo) From whatever 1 have gathered, this option seems true. The odd ratio for pregnancy in clomiphene citrates is 3.4 when compared to placebo. Here are some excerpts from medical journals \"A recent metaanalysis of four randomized placebo controlled studies state that clomiphene showed odds ratio for ovulation- 6.82 and for pregnancy- 3.42 as compared to placebo.\" \"Approximately 75-80% of patients with PCOS will ovulate after clomiphene citrate (Homburg, 2005; Messinis, 2005). Although there appears to he discrepancy between ovulation and pregnancy rates, life-table analysis of the largest and most reliable studies indicates a conception rate of up to 22% per cycle in those ovulating on clomiphene citrate (Hammond et al., 1983; Kousta et al., 1997,- Etikemans et al., 2003)\". \"The estimate for pregnancy per cycle with clomiphene versus no treatment for oligo-ovulation, is 3.4 (95% CI 1.23, 9.48) (Hughes et al., 1997)\". Option `d' (i.e.,it has been shown to increase ,feility in oligospermic males in randomized controlled trials.) Clontiphette citrate is commonly prescribed in male infeility to treat oligospermia, Despite its common use, its efficacy has not been firmly established. There have been several clinical trials confirming the efficacy of clomiphene in oligospermia. But the largest randomized controlled trial undeaken by WHO in 19.92 failed to demonstrate the efficacy of clomiphene in oligospermia. However, most of the subsequent trials though smaller in size, established the beneficial role of clomiphene in oligospennia. An aicle from www.medscape.com states; Antiestrogens in male infeility (clomiphene) \"The logic underlying the use of antiestrogens lies in their ability to orably alter the intrinsic HPG honnone axis. The most popular of these drugs is clomiphene citrate, a selective estrogen receptor modulator. By reducing hypothalamic and pituitary sensitivity to estrogens, antiestrogens increase pituitary output of LH and FSH, thus stimulating both testosterone production and spennatogenesis. Despite at least 20 clinical trials with clomiphene citrate for male infeility in the last 30 years, there is still debate about the value of antiestrogens for male infeility. A WHO study of 190 couples found clomiphene to have no significant effect on pregnancy rates or semen characteristics, while an older Cochrane meta-analysis of ten controlled studies involving 738 men showed beneficial hormonal effects, but no effect on pregnancy rates. However, there is emerging literature to suggest that clomiphene citrate may play an impoant role in a subgroup of infeile patients to overcome acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism at the pituitary level due to prolactinoma, sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus and thalassetnias. Other selective estrogen receptor modulator drugs, including tamoxifen citrate, act in a similar fashion to clomiphene citrate\". Option 'c' (i.e.,Incidence of twins is 5-6%) The incidence of twin pregnancy mentioned in the option is not far off from the actual incidence. \"The incidence of twin pregnancy with clomiphene ranges from minimum 6% to maximum 10%\". Still, we can consider this one incorrect.",

Pathological features : Forebrain and midbrain are absent. Cerebellum and Hindbrain are less involved or completely spared. Base of skull and facial bones are not affected. Pituitary gland is either absent or hypoplastic.deg As a result : Aarenai gnu is gland is diminished in slze.deg Such fetuses have bulging eyes, sho neck and a large tongue. Complications causea by Anencephaly during Pregnancy Polyhydramnios : seen in 35% cases.deg Causes : -- Diminished fetal swallowingdeg Secretion of CSF directly into the amniotic cavitydeg -- Excessive micturition.deg Preterm labour : due to associated polyhydramnios. Ma/presentation : Face presentation (Most common)deg and Breech presentation. Rather most common fetal anomaly responsib' for face presentation is Anencephaly Tendency for post maturity.deg Cause : -- Insufficient production of coisol from fetal adrenals leading to diminished oestriol. Complications during Labour Shoulder dystociadeg : Most common complication of anencephaly during labour. Obstructed labourdeg Risk of recurrence is 5% after one affected child and 13% after two affected children.deg Diagnosis : By ultrasound : Demonstration of - a. Absence of cranial vault and b. Angiomatous brain tissue. Time >14 weeks and Accuracy - 100% It can be diagnosed earliest by 8-10 weeks on ultrasound.deg Elevated levels of maternal serum alpha feto proteins.deg By amniocentesis : Purpose of amniocentesis is to measure concentration of alpha - feto protein (AFP) and acetyicholinesterase in amniotic fluid. Amniotic fluid acetyl cholinesterase has better diagnostic value than amniotic fluid AFP.deg",

The mesosalpinx covers the uterine tube and hangs below it to meet with the mesovarium. The mesovarium covers the ovary and ovarian ligament. It extends posteriorly from the mesosalpinx like a shelf. The mesometrium makes up the rest of the broad ligament. The ovarian ligament is located in the broad ligament but is not pa of the broad ligament. It is a round cord that attaches the ovary to the uterus just below the point where the uterine tube enters the uterus. The round ligament of the uterus reaches the lateral surface of the uterus below the uterine tube. It is continuous with the ovarian ligament and it holds the fundus of the uterus forward. The suspensory ligaments of the ovary are peritoneal folds that cover the ovarian neurovascular supply as these vessels pass over the pelvic brim to reach the ovary.

If lubrication is needed, glycerine, K-Y jelly or spermicidal jelly can be used.\nSoon after discharge, the male should withdraw the penis holding the condom firmly against his body\nTo increase the effectiveness, a dose of spermicidal jelly or foam tablet may be used at the same time. In case of breakage, slippage, or defective use, women should report or use emergency contraceptive within 72 hours and a spermicidal agent should be quicldy inserted into the vagina.\n\nAdvantages of condom\n\nCondoms gives very good protection against STDs.

In this late-onset form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), the enzyme deficiency leads to a relative coisol deficiency. In response, adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH) levels are increased to normalize coisol production. Adrenal hyperplasia and elevated androgens results as a consequence of this accommodation. Thus, symptoms of late-onset CAH reflect accumulation of precursor C19 steroid hormones. These precursors are conveed to dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone. Thus, signs of virilization predominate. Ref: Hoffman B.L., Schorge J.O., Schaffer J.I., Halvorson L.M., Bradshaw K.D., Cunningham F.G., Calver L.E. (2012). Chapter 17.

Estrogen mainly estradiol (the most potent estrogen), stimulates cervical mucus production and as its levels rise during the follicular phase mucus become more abundant, watery and less cellular. Progesterone inhibits cervical mucus production and makes it opaque, viscid and impenetrable. Cervical mucus: It is composed of 92-98% water, and 1% inorganic salts mainly sodium chloride. It also contains simple sugars, polysaccharides, proteins and glycoproteins. Its pH is usually alkaline ranging from 6.5 to 9.0. Ferning is a method used to estimate hormone levels. Ferning refers to the characteristic microscopic pattern that results from the crystallization of the inorganic salts in the cervical mucus when it is dried. As the level of estrogen increases, dried mucus begin to demonstrate ferning in the later pa of follicular phase. Absence of ferning indicates inadequate estrogen stimulation of endocervical glands or inhibition of endocervical glands by increased secretion of progesterone.

Her temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, pulse is 110/minute, and respirations are 14/minute. Abdominal examination reveals significant lower abdominal tenderness. Speculum examination shows scant blood in the vagina with a closed cervical os. Bimanual examination demonstrates significant left adnexal tenderness. Urine hCG is positive. Serum hCG is 5,000 mIU/mL. Pelvic ultrasound shows a normal uterus with a left adnexal mass surrounded by free fluid. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "This patient has a presentation that is most consistent with ectopic pregnancy. The most common presenting symptoms of patients with ectopic pregnancy are abdominal or pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding. However, many patients have ectopic pregnancies and are asymptomatic until they are discovered incidentally on ultrasound or until they rupture. Examination of a patient with ectopic pregnancy often demonstrates tenderness on the side of the ectopic pregnancy. Occasionally, a mass can be appreciated on that side. The keys to the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy are the serum hCG value and the ultrasound. This patient has a serum hCG level of 5,000 mIU/mL. At this hCG level, a pregnancy would be visualized if it were, in fact, in the uterus. This patient has an ultrasound showing nothing in the uterus with a mass in the left adnexa. This constellation of symptoms and findings are most consistent with the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Appendicitis can also present with abdominal pain. However, the pain and findings are most often on the right side of the patient's abdomen and this patient has a mass and tenderness on the left side. Fuhermore, vaginal bleeding and elevated hCG levels are not associated with appendicitis. Occasionally, a patient with ovarian cancer will have an hCG-secreting tumor. However, when a woman of childbearing age presents with abdominal pain and vaginal spotting and has a positive hCG value, the diagnosis is almost always pregnancy-related (either ectopic pregnancy, intrauterine pregnancy, or spontaneous aboion) and not ovarian cancer.

If the mother is infected during the first trimester the malformation rate in the fetus is approximately 50%.

Therefore, all women need to be vaccinated with the rubella vaccine-most often given as pa of the MMR series of vaccines. However, because the MMR vaccine is a live-virus vaccine, there is a concern that administration Of the vaccine within 3 months of conception, or during the pregnancy, could result in bih defects or illness. Yet, this concern is more theoretical than real as studies performed on women given the rubella vaccine sholy before becoming pregnant or during pregnancy have failed to show any increase in the risk of malformations compared to the general background risk in the population. To state that there is no vaccine risk and termination is completely inappropriate (choice A) is incorrect. Although the risk of the MMR vaccine appears more theoretical than real, one cannot state that there is no risk. To state that the vaccine risk is moderate and termination should be considered (choice C) or that the vaccine risk is high and termination should be strongly considered (choice D) is incorrect.

The nomenclature most commonly used in the United States is based upon the timing of the deceleration in relation to contractions--thus, early, late or variable in onset related to the corresponding uterine contraction. The waveform of these deceleration is also significant for pattern recognition. In early and Late deceleration, the slope of fetal hea rate change is gradual, resulting in a curvilinear and uniform or symmetrical waveform. With variable deceleration, the slope of fetal hea rate change is abrupt and erratic, giving the waveform a jagged appearance. It has been proposed that deceleration be defined as recurrent if they occur with 50 percent or more of contractions in any 20-minute period (NICHD Research Planning Workshop, 1997). Another system now used less often for description of deceleration is based on the pathophysiological events considered most likely to cause the pattern. In this system, early deceleration are termed head compression, Late deceleration are termed uteroplacental insufficiency, and variable deceleration become cord compression patterns. The nomenclature of type I (early), type II (late), and type III (variable) \"dips\" proposed by Caldeyro-Barcia and co- workers (1973) is not used in the United States.",

The trophoblast is made up of a single layer of cells. Cells of trophoblast multiply to form distinct layers. The cells that are near to the decidua lose their cell boundaries to form syncytium. This layer of the trophoblast is known as the syncytiotrophoblast. Deep to the syncytium, the cells of the trophobiast retain their cell walls and form the second layer called as the cyto trophoblast. The cyto trophobiast rests on the mesoderm. Small cavities appear in the syncytiotrophoblast called as Lacunae. The lacunae are separated from one another by paitions of syncytium called as trabeculae. The syncytiotrophoblast grows into the endometrium (Decidua). As the endometrium is eroded. some of the maternal blood vessels are opened up and blood from them fills the lacunar space. So. lacunae have maternal blood. Each trabeculas is, initially made up entirely of syncytiotrophoblast. Later cells of cytotrophoblast begin to multiply and grow into each trabeculas. This is called as Primary Extra embryonic mesoderm then invades the centre of each primary villus. This is now called as secondary villus.

American college of obstetrics and gynecology recommends that women with preterm contractions without cervical change, especially those with cervical dilation of less than 2 cm, generally should not be treated with tocolytics.\nIn general, if tocolytics are given, they should be administered concomitantly with corticosteroids. The gestational age range for their use in debatable. However, because corticosteroids are not generally used after 33 weeks and because the perinatal outcomes in preterm neonates are generally good after this time, most practitioners do not recommend use of tocolytics at or after 33 weeks. In this patient G: Age is 32 weeks and cervix is 2 cm dilated so the use of tocolytics is justified\n\nRescue cerclage (Williams 24/e, p 857): There is support for the concept that cervical incompetence and preterm labor lie on a spectrum leading to preterm delivery. If cervical incompetence is recognized with threatened preterm labor, then emergency cerclage can be attempted.\n\nCervical cerclage is done in 3 conditions:\n\nCervical incompetence\nProphylactically in women identified on USG to have short cervix <15 mm\nRescue cerclage\u2013as discussed above.\n\n\nAntibiotics: Do not have a role in preterm pregnancy with intact membranes. In a study (ORACLE 11 trial) antimicrobials were given to patients with preterm labor but without membrane rupture, the results were disappointing. In his review, Goldenberg (2002) also concluded that antimicrobial treatment of women with preterm labor for the sole purpose of preventing delivery is generally not recommended. In a follow-up of the ORACLE II trial, Kenyon and associates (2008 b) reported that fetal exposure to antimicrobials in this clinical setting was associated with an increased cerebral palsy rate at age 7 years compared with that of children without fetal exposure.",

First lets understand what does this signify -Endometrial thickness has been correlated with endometrial cancer risk in pe and post menopausal women. In postmenopausal females with : Atrophic endometrium Endometrial hyperplasia Endometrial cancer Endometrial thickness is 3.4 + 1.2 mm It is 9.7 + 2.5 mm It is 18.2 + 6.2 mm Sensitvities of 95 - 97% have been repoed using a measurement of < 4 mm for exclusion of endometrial cancer. Women with endometrial thickness > 5 mm warrant additional evaluation with saline infusion sonography (515), or hysteroscopy or endometrial biopsy. Also know : Diagnostic alongrithim to identify endometrial pathology in patient with abnormal uterine bleeding and with no risk factors for endometrial cancer.

Extra Edge : Clear cut endometrial thickness giudelines have not been established for premenopausal females. It is generally seen that normal endometrial thickness in premenopausal women does not exceed 4 mm on day 4 of menstrual cycle and 8 mm by day 8. A persistent finding of endometrial thickness > 12 mm independant of cycle day should prompt fuher evaluation in these women, especially in those with risk factors for endometrial carcinoma. Summary of diagnostic procedures in case of DUB if endometrial neoplasia is suspected : - There is is no clear sequence to the use of endometrial biopsy, TVS, SIS and hysteroscopy when evaluating abnormal uterine bleeding. - TVS - as it is well tolerated, cost effective and requires minimal technical skill is the first logical step. It addition TVS can determine whether a lesion is diffuse or focal - If endometrial hyperplasia / neoplasia is suspected - then endometrial biopsy is done. If there is a focal leison - either hysteroscopy or SIS is done.",

Patients may complain of urinary incontinence or an increase in vaginal discharge following pelvic surgery or pelvic radiotherapy with or without antecedent surgery. The drainage may be continuous; however, in the presence of a very small vesicovaginal fistula, it may be intermittent. Recurrent cystitis or pyelonephritis, abnormal urinary stream, and hematuria also should initiate a workup for vesicovaginal fistula. The time from initial insult to clinical presentation depends on the etiology of the vesicovaginal fistula. A vesicovaginal fistula secondary to a bladder laceration typically presents immediately. Approximately 90% of genitourinary fistulas associated with pelvic surgery are symptomatic within 7-30 days postoperatively. An a:lterior vaginal wall laceration associated with obstetric fistulas typically (75%) presents in the first 24 hours of delivery. In contrast, radiation-induced UGFs are associated with slowly progressive devascularization necrosis and may present 30 days to 30 years later. Patients with radiation-induced VVFs initially present with symptoms of radiation cystitis, hematuria, and bladder contracture.",

Uterine sarcoma * Fallopian tube carcinoma DUB - ovulatroy / anovulatory * Injuries - direct trauma / Decubitus ulcer / Foreign body Bleeding from urethera, bladder, rectum which is mistaken for vaginal bleeding.

Most common symptom Watery discharge which tracks from the tube through the uterus and vagina (hydrops tubal profluens).It is typically colourless, profuse in amount and escapes continuously or in gushes. The discharge ultimately becomes blood stained from ulceration of growth and female presents as post menopausal bleeding. (option \"d\" is correct). Cervical cancer is a cause of postmenopausal bleeding, but cervical carcinoma in situ which is seen at 25 - 35 years of age is not a cause of post menopausal bleeding.

In familial cases of ovarian cancer, the cancers tend to appear at a younger age, but are thought to possibly have, on an average, a slightly better prognosis than do isolated cases. Families with multiple cases of breast cancer due to genetic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 also have an increased incidence of ovarian cancers. The BRCA1 mutation is paicularly virulent, and up to 30-40% of women with this mutation develop ovarian cancer. (There are also families in which the women have a BRCA1 mutation and develop ovarian, but not breast cancer at an increased rate). Another cancer syndrome, the Lynch II syndrome (also known as the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome), is also associated with ovarian cancer (and cancers of the uterus, breast, stomach, and pancreas). In both the breast cancer families and the Lynch II families, the genetic pattern seen is usually autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Prophylactic oophorectomy is often offered women in cancer families who have reached the age of 35 and have had their children.

INVESTIGATIONS:The investigations required with procidentia are few, but renal ultrasonography and mid-stream urinalysis may be impoant, owing to potential for kinking of the ureters leading with consequent hydronephrosis and urine stasis due to incomplete emptying.In addition, some authors have suggested urodynamic investigations prior to surgery to help identify occult stress urinary incontinence and to attempt to predict those women with underlying voiding dysfunction.

        "question": "Test for ovarian reserve",
        "exp": "FSH Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce egg. The ovary is generally thought of as an egg bank from which the woman draws during the reproductive life. During the .flrst few days of each monthly cycle, under the influence of FSH and LH there is rapid growth of several follicles in the ovary. After a week or more of growth one of the follicles begin to outgrow. All the others and the remaining follicles involute (a process called atresia), and these follicles are said to become atretic. The process of atresia is impoant because it normally allows only one of the follicles to grow large enough, each month, to ovulate. This usually prevents more than one child from developing with each pregnancy. The single follicle reaches a diameter of 1-1.5 centimeters at the time of ovulation and is called the mature follicle. With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce eggs declines. Methods of assessing ovarian reserve: With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce egg declines i.e. ovarian reserve decrease with age. - Usually age is the best predictor of ovarian reserve but approximately 10% of women have an accelarated loss of ovarian reserve by their mid-30's. - So age alone does not tell the whole story. Consequently more refined methods .for predicting ovarian reserve have been developed. The methods for assessing ovarian reserve are classified into two groups:- a)Passive testing b)Dynamic testing The goal of both the approaches is to provide information regarding oocyte (egg) quality and quantity. Passive testing FSH level Early follicular phase FSH levels play an impoant role in pregnancy outcomes. As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this adaptive response remains unknown. A rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompained by a decline in oocyte quality. High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy. Generally FSH level are expected to be below 10 lu/mlin women withreproductive potential - In one study it was .found out that 3 day FSH of less than 15 mlu/ml were twice as likely to conceive than women with FSH values between 15 and 24.9 mlu/ml. - Cycle day 3 is chosen because at this time the estrogen level is expected to be low, a critical feature as FSH levels are subject to a negative feedback. - Thus any determination of FSH needs to include corresponding estradiol level to indicate that the FSH level was drawn when estrogen level was low. Other methods for passive ovarian reserve testing Measurement of Inhibin B Inhibit B is an ovarian hormone that inhibits FSH release. Although present in ovulating women it is not normally .found in postmenopausal women. - Low inhibin levels suggests poor ovarian reserve. Transvaginal ultrasound Diminished ovarian reserve means that fewer follicles are available for stimulation and recruitment by _feility drugs. Transvaginal ultrasound allows the observation of ovaries and assess the number of follicles (ovarian volume). Dynamic ovarian reserve testing Clomiphene citrate challenge test ? Clomiphene is an antiestrogen which inhibits the negative feedback of estrogen on hypothalamus i.e. the hypothalamus gets false signals that the patient does nor have enough estrogen. In response, the hypothalamus induces the pituitary gland to produce more FSH and LH. This is turn initiates follicular growth to produce estrogen. Clomiphene is able to exe this effect only when the estrogen level is low or the ovarian reserve is low. In a normal woman with adequate ovarian reserve there is enough inhibin and estrogen to suppress FSH production through negative feedback and resist the effects clomiphene. - When undergoing clomiphene citrate challenge test, the .first step is to measure day 3 FSH and estrogen. Then 100 ing of clomiphene is administered on cycles day 5 through 9 and FSH and estrogen measurements are repeated on cycle day 10. In general, a high day 10 FSH suggests poor ovarian reserve.",

Also know, In healthy women, an intravenous bolus of 10 units of oxytocin caused a transient but marked fall in aerial blood pressure that was followed by an abrupt increase in cardiac output. These hernodynamic changes could be dangerous to women already hypovolemic from hemorrhage or who had cardiac disease that limited cardiac output. The same danger is present for women with right to left cardiac shunts because the decrease in systemic resistance would fuher increase the shunt. So, - Oxytocin should not be given intravenously as a large bolus, but rather as a much more dilute solution by continuous intravenous infusion or as an intramuscular infection. Management of cardiac patient during pregnancy Antepaum Bed rest The most impoant measure for attenuating the impact of pregnancy on diseased hea is bed rest. Bed rest increases the venous return to the hea, improves renal perfusion, induces diuresis and promotes elimination of water. Dietory salt restriction It helps to prevent excess retention of sodium and water. Diuretics It should be given to cardiac pregnant patient if moderate restriction in sodium intake is insufficient to limit the normal intravascular volume expansion that occurs during gestation. Prophylactic digitalization It is commonly used in patients with severe hea disease who are not in ove congestive failure. During labour and delivery The pregnant cardiac patient should always labor and deliver in lateral supine position to avoid hemodynamic impairment caused by dorsal decubitus position. Effective pain relief during labour with morphine. Continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry. Restriction of i.v. fluids to 75 ml/hr (Almost all cardiac patients in labour should be kept on the dry side). Antibiotic prophylaxis (This is given in patients with congenital or acquired hea lesions). Thrombosis prophylaxis. Patient should be placed in sitting position after delivery.

The active phase usually stas at 3-4 cm cervical dilation and is subdivided into the acceleration, maximum slope, and deceleration phases.

Friends amongst the remaining two options Viz- Abdominal hysterectomy and Weheims Hysterectomy (also done by abdominal route). Logically speaking Weheim's Hysterectomy carries more risk of Ureter injury which means (not just cutting of Ureter but also includes ligation and devasculirization of ureters) because of 2 reasons : Weheim's is done in case of carcinomas and therefore lots of adhesions are present during surgery In Weheims - medial half of cardinal ligament is cut. Now if you remember the position of ureter. (See diag below). * Ureters are very prone to injury during cutting of medial half of cardinal ligaments. To suppo the above logic CGDT 10/e, p 779 says : \"The repoed incidence of ureteral injury during Gynaecologic procedures ranges from about 0.5% in simple hysterectomies for benign disease upto 1.6% for laparoscopic cases and to as high as 30% for some older series of Weheim's Radical Hysterectomies.\" Extra Edge : Impoant Anatomical locations where ureteric injury is common - At the level of infundibulo - pelvic ligaments.deg - Below the level of ischial spine.deg - At the level of internal cervical os - where uterine aery crosses the ureter frOM aOove.deg -Over the Anterior vaginal Fornix when ureter crosses it to enter the trigone of bladder.

Since she can tolerate jogging without a problem, she probably does not have stress-induced incontinence (SUI). Thus, the diagnosis will probably be made by cystometry to assess her urodynamics. This test is also used to evaluate bladder capacity and tone. An IVP would be used in a patient with renal failure. It would help delineate the cause of reduced urinary output. Essentially, a dye is injected, and films are taken to track the uptake in the kidneys. This would not help in the evaluation of incontinence. Stress testing reveals leakage of urine coincident with increased intra-abdominal pressure, which is diagnostic of stress urinary incontinence. The Q-tip test is an indirect measure of the urethral axis (angle of inclination). A Q-tip is inseed into the urethra with the patient in the lithotomy position. If the Q-tip moves more than 30 degrees from the horizontal, there is abnormal urethral mobility. This would be helpful in the evaluation of stress urinary incontinence, since it would help indicate a distoion between the urethra and the bladder.

There are two things to think about here First, you need to decide if a structure is pa of the uterus. If it is pa of the uterus, then you need to decide if it is shed during menstruation. The correct answer will be a structure that is pa of the uterus but is not shed during menstruation. Answers about structures that are not shed during menstruation because they are not pa of the uterine wall are incorrect. The myometrium is our correct answer. It is the middle muscular component of the uterine wall and it is not shed during menstruation. The endometrium is the inner mucosal coat of the uterus. It is shed during menstruation and exhibits many characteristic changes during the menstrual cycle. The mesometrium is the mesentary of the uterus which forms the major pa of the broad ligament of the uterus. It is not even pa of the internal lining of the uterus, so it's not the answer to look for. Cervical mucosa lines the cervix, which is the inferior poion of the uterus. This mucosa is shed during menstruation. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010). Chapter 6. Paurition. In F.G. Cunningham, K.J. Leveno, S.L.

Here in the case since leison is visible we can go for direct biopsy i.e., Punch biopsy. Also know : Details of Diagnostic modalities in Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and Carcinoma cervix : A. Pap smear : It is a screening procedure. The primary goal of cervical cytologic screening is to identify women in whom fuher evaluation by coloposcopy is required to detect the presence of true cancer precursor. A speculum is introduced in vagina without lubricant and material from cervix is collected using Ayre's spatula. Whole of squamo-columnar junction has to be scrapped i.e. rotate the spatula through 360deg (Ist slide) and another slide is made from posterior fornix which acts as control. For more details, about Pap smear, see Chapter no. 2 B. Schiller Test : Principle : * Normal mature squamous epithelium of cervix contains Glycogen, which combines with Lugol's iodine to produce a deep mahogany colour. Abnormal squamous / dysplastic epithelium does not stain and constitutes a positive schiller test. C. Colposcopy associated with biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of cervical precancer. Ideally all patients undergoing treatment for abnormal cervical smears should be colposcoped. The aim of colposcopy is to identify the extent of the lesion and eradicate it by destruction or excision. The whole of the transformation zone needs to be visualize, as this area is believed to be the site of neoplastic change. Indications : Abnormal Pap smear cytology To locate abnormal areasdeg To obtain directed biopsiesdeg Conservative therapy under colposcopy guidancedeg For follow up of cases treated conservativelydeg In case of a lesion grossly suggestive of invasive carcinoma, cone biopsy is not indicated as it predisposes the patient to serious pelvic infection and bleeding. The diagnosis of such lesion can be confirmed by colposcopic directed simple biopsy. Colposocopy is safe in pregnancy. D. Endocervical Curettage : Transformation zone also extends into the endocervical canal. By colposcopy upper 2/3 of endocervix is not visualised. Therefore evaluation of the non visualised pa of the endocervical canal should be done by Endocervical curettage. Endocervical curettage should be performed in every case. - In which colposcopy is unsatisfactory. - where the lesion is extending into the endocervical canal. - Where the colposcopic impression does not explain the cervical cytology findings. E. Cone E'iopsy is both a diagnostic and a therapeutic procedure. Indications (Diagnostic) : When limits of the lesion cannot be visualised with colposcopy.deg The squamo-columnar junction is not seen at colposcopy.deg In Endocervical curettage-histological findings are positive for CIN II or CIN III.deg There is a lack of correlation between cytology biopsy and colposcopy results.deg Microinvasive carcinoma or Adenocarcinoma in situ on colposcopy or cytology results.deg Therapeutic - In case of CIN III",

Less bleeding Possible risk or complication of open myomectomy is excessive bleeding during the operation requiring blood transfusion, anemia due to blood loss during the operation and in post-operative period. During hysteroscopic myomectomy, intraoperative bleeding is rare. Bleeding is unlikely unless vessels are lacerated or injured in the cervical canal or lower uterine segment during dilation or deep ablation or vaporization. Hysteroscopic Myomectomy Hysteroscpic myomectomy involves inseing a hysteroscope through the vagina and the cervix into the uterus. Hysteroscopes are so thin that they can fit through the cervix with minimal or no dilation. Because the instruments are inseed through the cervix, no abdominal incisions are needed. A resectoscope, which is a hysteroscope fitted with a wire loop that uses high-frequency electrical current to cut or coagulate tissue, is then inseed to remove the fibroids. The loop is placed around the fibroid, electrical energy passes through the loop, and the fibroid is cut loose. The fibroid can then be removed through the vagina. Advantages of Hysteroscpic Myomectomy: This procedure is most often done on an \"outpatient\" basis under general anesthesia. There is usually minimal discomfo during hysteroscopy. It takes about 60 minutes to complete the procedure, which is followed by a few hours of recovery time. Hysteroscopy can be used to remove fibroids on the inner wall of the uterus that have not grown deep into the uterine wall. Complications occur less than 1% of the time with hysteroscopic myomectomy. During hysteroscopic myomectomy, intraoperative bleeding is rare.

Question 36 asks : Polymenorrhea in a 45 years old woman for 6 months - first line of management. Whereas question 37 asks : Polymenorrhea in a 45 years old woman for 6 months - best line of management. Another thing which I want to point out here is : Question is on \"Polymenorrhea' and not DUB (Which generally refers to anovulatory DUB). As far as first line of management is concerned definately I would investigate the patient to rule out endometrial cancer. In this process I would perform diagnostic D & C . \"In the later reproductive years, even more care must be given to exclude pathological cause because of the possibility of endometrial cancer. Aspiration, curettage or both should clearly establish anovulatory or dyssynchronous cycles as the cause before hormone therapy is staed.\" As far as medical therapy is concerned : In ovulatory cycles - combined oral pills for 3 cycles is given. But staing OCP's in a perimenopausal female without prior investigations is not recommended. Now comes the -tricky\" pa : Best line of management in such cases. As far as D & C is concerned : \"Therapeutic curettage is of no value in the treatment of polymenorrhea.\" So, now we are left with 2 options either medical management with OCP's or hysterectomy. The place of surgery in the treatment of excessive bleeding without an organic basis varies with the age of the patient; it should be a last reso in young girls but may be considered earlier in women above the age of 40 years. Neveheless, in the latter group it is good practice to exclude organic disease by ultrasound and endometrial aspiration, to try medical therapy and proceed to hysterectomy if the response is inadequate or not sustained. When the patient is above 40 years of age, and when the hemorrhage fails to respond to simpler measure, hysterectomy is indicated. It is the treatment of choice in all cases of persistent or recurrent postmenopausal bleeding for which there is no obvious cause. Therefore, hysterectomy is the last reso, first medical management is tried. Hysterectomy personally I feel is not the best treatment as it is a major surgery, has its own complications and high rate of morbidity. I will not advise hysterectomy to all patients who come to me with complain of polymenorrhea of 6 months duration. But it is a dicy question. You will have to decide for yourself.",

Since the USG in this patient does not show a sac and the level of HCG is low its level should be repeated after 48 hours to exclude ectopic pregnancy. In normal pregnancy at 5-6 weeks of gestation, a gestational sac is visible on ultrasound. A beta-hCG level of 6500 mU/mL with an empty uterine cavity by transabdominal ultrasound is highly suspicious for an ectopic pregnancy. A beta-hCG value of 2000 mU/mL or more can be indicative of an ectopic pregnancy if no products of conception are detected within the uterine cavity by transvaginal ultrasound.

        "exp": "Macroadenoma > 1 cm is associated with bad prognosis Prolactinomas are prolactin secreting tumours of the pituitary It is a benign tumour They are the most common type of pituitary tumour0 They are .five times more common in women Prolactittomas are an impoant cause of infeility in women - They constitute about 1/3rd cases of infeility Treatment of prolactinomas restores feility - Women undergoing infeility t/t for prolactinoma gets pregnant However an impoant point to note is that pregnancy causes growth of prolactinomas -The rising estrogen levels during pregnancy have a marked stimulatory effect on normal lactotrophs. - Hyperophy and hyperplasia of the lactotrophs results in an upto 1.5 fold increase in pituitary size. - Such increase in size may also occur with prolactinomas mostly in the second and third trimesters. \"About 1.2% microprolactinomas and about 24% of macro- prolactinomas increase in size during pregnancy\". Management of prolactinoma in pregnancy Microprolactinoma -For women with microprolactinoma the subsequent risk of adenomas growth during pregnancy appears to be 1%, once the drug is discontinued - In these cases drug is discontinued once the patients is pregnant - Symptomatic follow up should be done each trimester, and treatment is reinitiated, only if symptoms of tumour growth develops. Macro prolactinoma For women with maeroprolactinoma there is 23% risk of tumour enlargement. - In these cases optimal choice of t/t is more difficult to determine. The patient should be advised to reduce the tumour size by medical treatment prior to pregnancy or at least responsiveness of the tumour to medical treatment should he established. - After conception bromocriptine may be stopped or continued during pregnancy depending on the aggressiveness of the tumour. - It symptoms of rumour appear of regrowth develops therapy is reinitiated. If medical t/t .fails surgery is recommended. Treatment during pregnancy - Treatment of women with lactotroph adenomas should begin before conception with advice to the woman and her paner about the risks of pregnancy to her and the .fetus. - The woman is then monitored during pregnancy and, if relevant, nursing. - The approach outlined here is consistent with the 2011 Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinenzia. - When a dopamine agonist is needed to lower the serum prolactin concentration to permit ovulation, we suggest bromocriptine rather than cabergoline, because of the greater ceainty that it does not cause bih defects, as described above. However, if a woman cannot tolerate bromocriptine, we recommend cabergoline. Microadenomas A woman who has a lactotroph microadenoma should be told that the risk of clinically impoant enlargement of her adenoma during pregnancy is very small (1.2%) and that it should not be a deterrent to becoming pregnant. - She should also he told that bromocriptine or caber' oline will likely be effective if symptoms do occur. - If she is willing to take this risk, she should be given bromocriptine or cabergoline before pregnancy in whatever dose is necessary to lower her serum prolactin concentration to normal. - Bromocriptine is still the preferred drug Pr this purpose .for most women because of the greater experience with it. When the serum prolactin concentration is normal and menses have occurred regularly for a few months, the woman can attempt to become pregnant. Bromocriptine should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy has been confirmed, an approach that is safe given the lack of apparent toxicity during the first trimester. If the adenoma is not responsive to a dopamine agonist, ovulation can usually be induced by administration of other ovulation induction agents. During the pregnancy, the woman should be seen every three months and asked about headaches and changes in vision. If no symptoms occur, serum prolactin can be measured two months after delivery or cessation of nursing, and if it is similar to the pretreatment value, the drug can he resumed. Treatment is initiated during pregnancy when there is tumour growth or symptoms develop. Macroadenomas - A woman who has a lactotroph macroadenoma should be advised of the relatively higher risk of clinically impoant tumor enlargement during pregnancy (23%). - Advice and monitoring depend upon how large the adenoma is. If the adenoma does not elevate the optic chiasm - Treatment with bromocriptine or cabergoline for a sufficient period to shrink it substantially should reduce the chance of clinically impoant enlargement during pregnancy. Once this has occurred, the woman can attempt to become pregnant; the dopamine agonist should be discontinued when pregnancy has been confirmed. Monitoring during pregnancy should be similar to that described above for women with microadenomas. A perceived change in vision should be assessed by a neuroophthalmologist, and an MRI should be performed if an abnormality consistent with a pituitary adenoma is confirmed. If the adenoma has enlarged to a degree that could account for the symptoms, the woman should be treated with bromocriptine throughout the remainder of the pregnancy, which will usually decrease the size of the adenoma and allete the symptoms. - If the adenoma does not respond to bromocriptine, cabergoline may be successful. If cabergoline is not successful, transsphenoidal surgery could be considered in the second trimester if vision is severely compromised. In comparison, surgery for persistent visual symptoms in the third trimester should be deferred until delivery if possible. If the adenoma is very large or elevates the optic chiasm - Pregnancy should be strongly discouraged until the adenoma has been treated by transsphenoidal surgery, and perhaps postoperatively by radiation. - Postoperative treatment with bromocriptine or cabergoline may also be helpful in reducing adenoma size fuher and lowering the serum prolactin concentration to normal. - Such a regimen reduces the chance that symptomatic expansion will occur during pregnancy, but it may still occur. Pregnancy should also be discouraged in a woman whose macroadenoma is unresponsive to bromocriptine and cabergoline, even if it is not elevating the optic chiasm, until the size has been greatly reduced by transsphenoidal surgery, because medical treatment would not likely be effective if the adenoma enlarges during pregnancy. Breast feeding - Breast feeding does not increase the risk of lactotroph adenoma growth. -Therefore, breastfeeding is an option for women with micro- and macroadenomas that remained stable in size during pregnancy. - However, dopamine agonist treatment should be withheld until breastfeeding is completed. - In contrast, breastfeeding is contraindicated in women who have neurologic symptoms at the time of delivery (suggesting tumor growth), because they should be treated with a dopamine agonist. We are unable to comprehend the option 'c' Prolactinomas are classified as macroprolactinomas only when they are > 10 mm or 1 cm. - May be , the correct option would have been prolactinoma > 10 mm are associated with worse prognosis. - Macroprolactinomas are definityly associated with worse prognosis during pregnancy. - \"Approximately 23% macroprolactinomas increase in size during pregnancy as compared to 1-2 microprolactinomas\". Increase in prolactin level associated with worse prognosis.???? We are not sure of this option Increased prolactin levels are definitely associated with worse prognosis in nonpregnant women whether, it retains the same prognostic significance during pregnancy is doubtful because during pregnancy there is significant increase in prolactin level. It becomes quite difficult to distinguish whether this elevation is due to tumour activity or pregnancy itself. Dewhurst says \"Prolactin levels should not be checked as they increase by as much as 10 folds by 25th week of gestation\". Williams obstetrics says \"Serial serum prolactin levels are not recommended because of normal increase during pregnancy\".",
