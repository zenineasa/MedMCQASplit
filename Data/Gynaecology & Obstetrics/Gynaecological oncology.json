Malignant mixed miillerian tumors have an increased association with previous pelvic irradiation. Like leiomyosarcomas, they are bulky polypoid tumors that often protrude from the cervix and bleed. Unlike pure leiomyosarcomas, however, they are an adenocarcinoma plus a malignant sarcoma, or a malignant sarcoma that is not indigenous to the uterus (rhabdomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, or osteogenic sarcoma).

        "exp": "Cervical cancer is the most common genital tract malignancy in females in India.There are many clinical characteristics that predispose a woman to cervical cancer. These high-risk features are: Average age 35-45 years. Pre-cancerous lesions occur 10-15 years earlier. Coitus before the age of 18 years. Multiple sexual paners. Delivery of the first baby before the age of 20 years. Multiparity with poor bih spacing between pregnancies. Poor personal hygiene. Carcinoma of the cervix shares similar epidemiological features to those of sexually transmitted diseases and viral infections and these are strongly linked to cancer cervix as causative agents. Poor socioeconomic status. At one time, exposure to smegma from uncircumcised paners was considered an impoant factor, accounting for lower incidence of cancer of the cervix amongst Jews and Muslims. Now it is realized that the incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV) is low in circumcised men, and that is the reason for low incidence of cancer in their wives. Smoking and drug abuse, including alcohol, are immunosuppressive (13-fold). Women with STD, HIV infection, herpes simplex virus 2 infection, HPV infection (16, 18, 31, 33) and condylomata have a high predisposition to cancer. Of these, HPV is now considered the most impoant oncogenic cause. Most HPV infection 16, 18 are symptomless in young women and clear within 2 years. Persistent infection is the cause of cancer of the cervix in 70-90% cases.Before the age of 30 years, 90% women with intact immune system are able to get rid of HPV infections. 10% with persistent infection after the age of 30 years tend to progress to CIN or invasive cancer. Immunosuppressed individuals (following transplant surgery), viral infections and HIV. Women with pre-invasive lesions. Women who do not come for regular health check-up and Pap tests. COC and progestogens use over 8-year periods can cause adenocarcinoma of the endocervix (double the risk). Five per cent women exposed to diethylstilboestrol in utero developed carcinoma of vagina and cervix. With withdrawal of this hormone, its incidence has dropped.

Parry Jones was the first to describe the lymphatic spread that occurs in a systematic manner. At first, the superficial inguinal nodes are involved through lymphatic emboli, but later lymphatic channel permeation occurs causing lymphatic blockage and leg oedema. The malignancy spreads to deep nodes and the gland of Cloquet (uppermost of the femoral or the lowermost of the external iliac gland) to the external iliac glands, obturator and common iliac nodes in the advanced stages. Laterally placed tumours rarely spread to the contralateral inguinal glands, but centrally located lesion involves the lymph nodes of the opposite side in 25% cases and this is because of crossing of lymphatics in the midline. Lymph nodes not clinically suspicious may show metastasis in about 25% cases. Inguinal lymph nodes are involved in 10% in Stage I, 30% in Stage II, 70% in Stage III and 100% cases in Stage IV. Lymphatics of the clitoris drain directly into the pelvic lymph nodes. The regional lymph nodes are assessed by MRI and PET. The involvement of the lymph nodes depends upon the site of the lesion, its size and depth of invasion. Reference : Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology 16th edition page no 479",

        "exp": "The patient most likely has a gonadoblastoma, which is sometimes associated with ceain types of Turner syndrome.Turner syndrome is characterized by an XO genotype (~ 60%) without any Barr body. Approximately, 40% of patients are mosaics with an XX/XO, a 45 XO/46 XX, or an XO/46 XY karyotype. The presence of a Y chromosome poses an increased risk for germ cell tumors of the streak gonads (ovary without eggs). Dysgerminomas and gonadoblastomas (germ cell plus sex cord stromal tumor) are the two most common tumors associated with this abnormality. Both of these tumors are also seen in ceain types of gonadal dysgenesis where there is female pseudohermaphroditism, that is, genotypic females with male appearing external genitalia. Gonadoblastomas, unlike dysgerminomas, frequently contain foci of calcification that are visible on abdominal films, as in this patient. Other primary ovarian tumors that frequently produce visible calcifications on abdominal films are cystic teratomas (bone and teeth) and fibromas.Dysgerminomas of the ovary are the female counterpa of seminomas of the testicle and pinealomas in the central nervous system. They are the most common malignant germ cell tumor of the ovary, whereas cystic teratomas are the most common benign germ cell tumor. Dysgerminomas are bilateral in 10% of cases. They are solid tumors that contain large, anaplastic cells with prominent nucleoli intermixed with a benign lymphoid infiltrate. Dysgerminomas, like seminomas, are extremely radiosensitive tumors and have an excellent 5 year survival rate.Cystic teratomas, fibromas, and Brenner tumors of the ovary are not associated with Turner syndrome.",

Carcinoma of the cervix shares similar epidemiological features to those of sexually transmitted diseases and viral infections and these are strongly linked to cancer cervix as causative agents. Poor socioeconomic status. At one time, exposure to smegma from uncircumcised paners was considered an impoant factor, accounting for lower incidence of cancer of the cervix amongst Jews and Muslims. Now it is realized that the incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV) is low in circumcised men, and that is the reason for low incidence of cancer in their wives. Smoking and drug abuse, including alcohol, are immunosuppressive (13-fold). Women with STD, HIV infection, herpes simplex virus 2 infection, HPV infection (16, 18, 31, 33) and condylomata have a high predisposition to cancer. Of these, HPV is now considered the most impoant oncogenic cause. Most HPV infection 16, 18 are symptomless in young women and clear within 2 years. Persistent infection is the cause of cancer of the cervix in 70-90% cases.Before the age of 30 years, 90% women with intact immune system are able to get rid of HPV infections. 10% with persistent infection after the age of 30 years tend to progress to CIN or invasive cancer.

It usually arises in young women or in children, with an average incidence at the age of 20. The tumour is solid with a peculiar elastic rubbery consistency and a smooth, firm capsule. The cut surface is yellow or grey with areas of degeneration and haemorrhage. The size is variable, usually moderate, though large tumours have been described. It is usually unilateral, bilateral in 10%, occasionally undergoes torsion and may, like all solid tumours, be associated with ascites. The tumour consists of large cells arranged in bunches or alveoli. Lymphocytes and giant cells are always found amongst the tumour cells. This appearance of large dark-staining nuclei with clear, almost translucent, cytoplasm and lymphocytic infiltration of the fibrous septa is diagnostic. The tumour is neutral and does not secrete either male or female sex hormones but placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and b-hCG. A number of patients with a dysgerminoma of the ovary have been repoed to show genital abnormality, with hypoplasia or absence of some pa of the genital tract. The malignancy rate is 30-50% and depends largely on the findings at laparotomy A unilateral tumour confined to one ovary is relatively benign. The presence of active invasion of the pelvic viscera is of poor prognosis. The presence of extra pelvic metastases in the general peritoneal cavity, lymph glands, omentum or liver renders the outlook hopeless.

The cells are more differentiated towards the surface. Mild dysplasia due to infection is often seen in young women indulging in sexual activity. CIN-I is lately described as low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) according to the Bethesda classification. 'Ascus' is a term described in the Bethesda system as atypical cells of undetermined significance. The intermediate cells mostly display mild dysplasia with enlarged nuclei and irregular outline. One per cent progress to cancer over the years. 2. Moderate dysplasia (CIN-II). Undifferentiated cells occupy the lower 50-75% of the epithelial thickness. The cells are mostly intermediate with moderate nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia, irregular chromatin and multiple nucleation. Thiy per cent of CIN II regress, 40% persist and the rest progress to invasive cancer. 3. Severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (CIN-III). In this grade of dysplasia, the entire thickness of the epithelium is replaced by abnormal cells. There is no cornification and stratification is lost. The basement membrane, however, is intact and there is no stromal infiltration. Often, an abrupt change in histological appearance from normal to abnormal is apparent. The cytology cells are mostly parabasal with increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. The nuclei are irregular, with coarse chromatin material; mitosis and multinucleation are common. Almost all progress to invasive cancer over 10-15 years. 4. Tadpole cells are seen in invasive cancer. CIN-II and CIN-III are described as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) according to the latest Bethesda classification. HSIL have a propensity to progress and become invasive, and therefore need investigations and treatment.In cervix , low grade squamous Intraepithelial leison ( LSIL ) in 2001 Bethseda system includes cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I Reference: Textbook of Gynaecology; 16th edition; Pg no:486",

        "exp": "The patient has cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III with koilocytic atypia secondary to the human papillomavirus. The designation CIN III encompasses both severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ.Cervical dysplasia is a precursor lesion of cervical squamous cancer. Most cases of cervical dysplasia occur in women in their late 20s and 30s. The pathogenesis of cervical dysplasia and cancer is an early age of first intercourse, multiple sexual paners, male paner(s) with multiple previous sexual panners, smoking, immunosuppression (renal transplants, AIDS), a strong association with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16, 18, 31, and herpes infection (possible cocarcinogen with HPV).Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a system for classifying dysplasia into mild, moderate, severe, and carcinoma in situ. The histologic correlations to these designations include CIN I (mild dysplasia), which involves the innermost one third of the cervical epithelium; CIN II (moderate dysplasia), which involves two thirds the thickness of the epithelium; and CIN III (severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ), which involves in the full thickness of the epithelium.Koilocytosis refers to squamous cells with wrinkled nuclei surrounded by a perinuclear halo. It correlates with the presence of HPV. Colposcopy involves inspection of the cervix with a stereoscopic binocular microscope after the cervix has been saturated with acetic acid. It aids the clinician in identifying abnormal areas to biopsy.",
