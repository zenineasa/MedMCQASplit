The attacks are associated with nausea, vomiting, and prostration. Aural fullness is a manifestation always present in Meniere's attackPathologically, there is generalized dilation of the membranous labyrinth that includes the scala media and endolymphatic sac and is associated with occasional membrane breaks and intermingling of endolymph and perilymph.Circulating immune complexes may be involved in the pathogenesis of Meniere's diseasePatients with severe hydrops should be treated with diuretics, salt restriction, a low-caffeine diet, avoidance of nicotine, and labyrinthine sedatives such as diazepam, 5 mg three times daily, to prevent recurrent attacks.Surgical treatment is currently reserved for patients with severe incapacitating vertigo or tinnitus or to prevent further deterioration of hearing.",
