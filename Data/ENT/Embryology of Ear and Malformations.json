These tubercles (hillocks) should unite during the next few weeks of embryogenesis to form auricle.o Preauricular sinuses are thought to occur as a result of incomplete fusion of these hillockso A preauricular sinus occurs either sporadically or is inherited. Unilateral cases are more often sporadic and occur more frequently on right side. Bilateral cases are more likely to be inherited with incomplete autosomal dominance pattern of inheritance.o Preauricular sinus is commonly seen at the root of helix. It may get repeatedly infected causing purulent discharge. Abscess may also form. Treatment is surgical excision of the track if the sinus gets repeated infection.",
