Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cartilage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S.aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body.Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externao Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor)o Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency )o ChemotherapyClinical features of malignant otitis externao Severe pain inside the ear and may get worse when moving head.o Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cartilagenous part,o Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent.o Fevero Itching of ear or ear canalo Troubled swallowing & weakness of face.Complicationso Cranial nerve palsies most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal),o Jugular venous thrombosiso Cavernous sinus thrombosiso MeningitisTreatment of malignant otitis externao In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonalpenicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e.g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocorticoid is also used. Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only. Extensive surgical debridement once an important part of the treatment is now rarely needed.",
