The motor fibres of Facial nerve take a very long time to get affected hence facial weakness is seen quiet late in acoustic neuroma. So loss of corneal reflex in acoustic neuroma, initially and largely, is due to involvement of the sensory efferent element of the reflex arc, i.e. 5th nerve. Technically involvement of motor aspect of facial nerve occurring late in the course of Acoustic neuroma will also contribute to loss of corneal reflex but better signs for looking facial nerve involvement, i.e. the signs eliciting facial muscle movements will now be there.Corneal reflex is done primarily to check 5th nerve involvement. This reflex should be elicited carefully avoiding injury to the cornea.",
