The symptoms affect just one paicular pa of the body, depending on which nerve is affected. nerve conduction studies help to confirm the diagnosis.

Alternatively, there may be expansion of the tissues around a nerve in a space where there is little room for this to occur, as is often the case in to a specific condition such as aly, hypothyroidism or scleroderma and soriasis * Some conditions cause nerves to be paicularly susceptible to compression.
