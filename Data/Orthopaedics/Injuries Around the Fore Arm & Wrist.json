It is caused by a fall on an out-stretched hand. It may also result from a direct blow on the back of the upper forearm.* These fall into two main categories depending upon the angulation of the ulna fracture - extension and flexion type. The extension type, is the commoner of the two, where the ulna fracture angulates anteriorly (extends) and the radial head dislocates anteriorly. The flexion type is where the ulna fracture angulates posteriorly (flexes) and the radial head dislocates posteriorly.* In a case with an isolated fracture of the ulna in its upper half, a dislocation of the head of the radius should be carefully looked for.* This is a very unstable injury, frequently redisplacing even if it has been reduced once. One attempt at reduction under general anaesthesia is justified. If reduction is successful, a close watch is kept by weekly check X-rays for the initial 3-4 weeks. In case, the reduction is not possible or if redisplacement occurs, an open reduction and internal fixation using a plate is performed. The radial head automatically falls into position, once the ulna fracture is reduced.* Malunion occurs commonly in cases treated conservatively, because of an undetected redisplacement within the plaster. It causes deformity of the forearm and limitation of elbow and forearm movements.",

Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the median nerve is compressed in the carpal tunnel below flexor retinaculum. The carpal tunnel is a narrow rigid passage way of ligament and bones at the base of hand, in front of distal part of wrist. Carpal tunnel houses the median nerve and 9 tendons (4 FDS, 4 FDP & FPL).Causes of carpal tunnel syndrome* There are many causes of carpal tunnel syndrome: -1) Idiopathic: - This is the most common cause.2) Pregnancy and menopause3) Metabolic : - Gout, Diabetes mellitus4) Endocrine: - Hypothyroidism, Myxedema, Acromegaly, Hyperparathyroidism.5) Deposition disorder:- Amyloidosis, Sarcoidosis, Rheumatid arthritis, Leukemia, CRF, Mucopoly-saccharoidosis.6) Alcoholism7) Local causes: - Malunited colies fracture, osteo-arthritis of the carpal bones, synovitits of flexor tendon sheath, hematoma.Clinical features of carpal tunnel syndrome* Carpal tunnel syndrome is more common in women and occurs between 35-50 years.* Symptoms usually start gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, paresthesia and numbness in the distribution of median nerve, i.e., lateral three & half of fingers and lateral 2/3rd of palm.* The symptoms often first appear during night, since many people sleep with flexed wrists. (Flexion decreases the space in carpal tunnel which results in increased pressure over median nerve).* Sensory symptoms can often be reproduced by percussing over median nerve (TineVs sign) or by holding the wrist fully flexed for a minute (Phalen's test).* As the disease progresses, clumsiness of hand and impairment of digital function develop.* Later in the disease, there is sensory loss in median nerve distribution and obvious wasting of thenar eminence.",

Maheshwari, Orthopaedics, 2nd/pg.98)RENNET'S FRACTURE# Bennet's fracture is an oblique intra-articular fracture of the base of 1st metacarpal with subluxation or dislocation of the metacarpal.# Rx by accurate reduction & restoration of the smooth joint surface is important as any abnormality in congruity of the articular surface will lead to osteoarthritis. Following methods are used for treatment:# (1). Closed manipulation & plaster cast.# (2). Closed reduction & percutaneous fixation under X-ray control.# (3). Open reduction & internal fixation with K-wire/screw may be necessary in some cases.Bennett's fractureAn oblique fracture at the base of the first metacarpal that involves the first carpometacarpal joint space. Such a fracture is often unstable, as the distal fragment is distracted by the unopposed abductor pollicis longus muscle, and may require surgical intervention.Rolando's fractureA fracture similar to Bennett's fracture with comminution of the metacarpal. This injury is actually less prone to displacement of the distal fragment due to the comminution of the thumb base and is less likely to require surgical fixation than is a Bennett's fracture.Game keeper's (skier's) thumbForced abduction of the thumb can result in disruption of the ulnar collateral ligament of the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP) of the thumb, a major stabilizer of the thumb.Boxer's fractureFractures of the fourth and fifth metacarpals are common and are usually the result of punching a hard object. The fracture may involve the midshaft or distal end of the bone, and is usually dorsally angulated.",
