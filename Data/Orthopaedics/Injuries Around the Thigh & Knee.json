It is the great extensor muscle of the knee. It is subdivided into four separate portions or 'heads', which have received distinctive names: Rectus femoris occupies the middle of the thigh, covering most of the other three quadriceps muscles. It originates on the ilium. It is named from its straight course.# The other three lie deep to rectus femoris and originate from the body of the femur, which they cover from the trochanters to the condyles: Vastus lateralis is on the lateral side of the femur (i.e on the outer side of the thigh). Vastus medialis is on the medial side of the femur (i.e. on the inner part thigh). Vastus intermedius lies between vastus lateralis and vastus medialis on the front of the femur (i.e. on the top or front of the thigh), but deep to the rectus femoris. Typically, it cannot be seen without dissection of the rectus femoris.* Quadriceps femoris is the main and only extensor of knee.# It produces locking action as a result of medial rotation of the femur during the last stage of extension.# To reverse this lock popliteus muscle comes into action and does so by the lateral rotation of femur* Remember: Lock is: Quadriceps femoris muscle and,Key is popliteus muscle.",

Anatomical studies have shown the contributions of the various portions of the quadriceps muscle to knee extension.* The vastus lateralis pulls laterally to the frontal plane of the femur at an angle of 7 to 10 degrees.* The vastus medialis is divided into two parts--the vastus medialis longus (with its muscle fibers pulling at 15 to 18 degrees medially) and the vastus medialis obliquus (with its muscle fibers pulling at a relatively horizontal 50 to 55 degrees medially).* The primary function of the vastus medialis obliquus muscle is to stabilize the patella against the lateral pull of the vastus lateralis, making the vastus medialis obliquus the dynamic stabilizer of the patella.* Static factors, the primary stabilizers of the patella, include the shape of the patella, the femoral sulcus, a patellar tendon of appropriate length, and a normally tensioned medial capsule reinforced by the patellofemoral and patellotibial ligaments.* The main factor that results in recurrent patellar dislocation is incompetence of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL).* The MPFL is an extrasynovial ligament, as is the medial collateral ligament.

For example, HO may occur after orthopedic procedures such as hip, knee, shoulder, or elbow arthroplasty; fractures; joint dislocations; or soft-tissue trauma,Neurogenic cause- such as spinal cord injury or central nervous system injury (usually without direct trauma to the soft tissues, where bone formation will occur)This condition should not be confused with metastatic calcification--such as may be seen with hypercalcemia-- and dystrophic calcification, which occurs in morbid tissues such as tumor.Early symptoms are: pain, fever, swelling, erythema, and decreased joint mobility.Later, reduced range of motion and ankylosis of the joint may occur.Investigations:Alkaline phosphatase and 24-h PGI 1/4 urinary excretion measurements are recommended as screening tests for HO.Three-phase bone scintigraphy is the most sensitive imaging modality for early detection of HO.Treatment of HOComplications of HO include peripheral nerve entrapment, pressure ulcers, and functional impairment if joint ankylosis develop. Therefore, prophylaxis or early treatment of HO is extremely important.Treatment or prophylaxis of HO includes:passive range of motion exercisesnonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (such as indomethacin), or a diphosphonate (such as ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1- diphosphate).local radiation therapysurgery can also be done to relieve functional impairment of joint.",

        "question": "Lachman's test is done with knee in____ degree of flexion",
        "exp": "Ans. b (20). (Ref. Current orthopaedics, Chapter 4).LACHMAN TEST is the most sensitive test for ACL tears. It is done with the knee flexed at 20 degrees, stabilizing the distal femur with one hand and pulling forward on the proximal tibia with the other hand. With an intact ligament, minimal translation of the tibia occurs and a firm end point is felt. With a torn ACL, more translation is noted, and the end point is soft or mushy. The hamstring muscles must be relaxed during this maneuver to prevent false-negative findings. Comparison of the injured and uninjured knees is essential.Also Remember:Anterior Drawer TestIt is done with the knee at 90 degrees of flexion and is not as sensitive as the Lachman test but serves as an adjunct in the evaluation of ACL instability. With the patient supine and the knee flexed to 90 degrees (hip flexed to approximately 45 degrees), the foot is restrained by sitting on it, and the examiner's hands are placed around the proximal tibia. Then while the hamstrings are felt to relax and the tibia is pulled forward, the displacement and the endpoint are evaluated.Pivot shift test ( Losee Test)It demonstrates the instability associated with an ACL tear. As described by Losee, a valgus and internal rotation force is applied to the tibia. Starting at 45 degrees of flexion, the lateral tibial plateau is reduced. Extending the knee causes the lateral plateau to subluxate anteriorly with a thud at approx 20 degrees of flexion. It reduces quietly at full extension.Posterior Drawer TestThe posterior drawer test evaluates the integrity of the PCL. It is performed with posterior pressure on the proximal tibia with the knee flexed at 90 degrees. Normally, the tibial plateau is anterior to the femoral condyles, and a step-off to the tibia is palpated when the thumb is slid down the femoral condyles. With a PCL injury, sagging of the tibial plateau may be appreciated, and no step-off is palpated. An associated contusion on the anterior tibia suggests a PCL injury. The posterior drawer test is done in the same fashion as the anterior drawer test, except that the examiner exerts a posterior force. The posterior sag seen in posterior cruciate disruption.The McMurray TestWith the McMurray test, forced flexion and rotation of the knee elicits a clunk along the joint line if there is a meniscus injury. Found in < 10 % of patients with a meniscus injury, joint line pain with the McMurray test is much more common.",

        "question": "McMurray's test is useful clinical test to assess injury to?",
        "exp": "Ans. C. Meniscus injury. (Ref. Orthopedics by Ebnezar 4th/Pg. 257).A positive McMurray fs test is diagnostic of a meniscal injury.McMurray test# The McMurray test, also known as the McMurray circumduction test is used to evaluate individuals for tears in the meniscus of the knee. It is a rotation test for demonstrating tom cartilage of the knee. A tear in the meniscus may cause a pedunculated tag of the meniscus which may become jammed between the joint surfaces,# To perform the test, the knee is held by one hand, which is placed along the joint line, and flexed to complete flexion while the foot is held by the sole with the other hand. The examiner then places one hand on the lateral side of the knee to stabilize the joint and provide a valgus stress in order to identify a valgus deformity. The other hand rotates the leg externally while extending the knee. If pain or a \"click\" is felt, this constitutes a \"positive McMurray test\" for a tear in the medial meniscus. Likewise the medial knee can be stabilized in a fully flexed position and the leg internally rotated as the leg is extended. A tag, caused by a tear will cause a palpable or even audible click on extension of the knee. A positive test indicates a tear of the lateral meniscus.# Studies show that this clinical test had a sensitivity of 58.5%, a specificity of 93.4%, and the predictive value of a positive result was 82.6%.The pivot-shift test, anterior drawer test and the Lachman test are used during the clinical examination of suspected ACL injury.Anterior drawer testThe anterior drawer test for anterior cruciate ligament laxity is one of many medical tests used to determine the integrity of the anterior cruciate ligament. It can be used to help diagnose sprain and tears.The test is performed as follows: the patient is positioned lying supine with the hip flexed to 45deg and the knee to 90deg. The examiner positions themselves by sitting on the examination table in front of the involved knee and grasping the tibia just below the joint line of the knee. The thumbs are placed along the joint line on either side of the patellar tendon. The index fingers are used to palpate the hamstring tendons to ensure that they are relaxed; the hamstring muscle group must be relaxed to ensure a proper test. The tibia is then drawn forward anteriorly. An increased amount of anterior tibial translation compared with the opposite limb or lack of a firm end-point indicates either a sprain of the anteromedial bundle of the ACL or a complete tear of the ACL. This test should be performed along with other ACL-specific tests to help obtain a proper diagnosis.Lachman testThe Lachman test is an orthopedic test used for examining the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee for patients where there is a suspicion of a tom ACL.The Lachman test is most reliable and sensitive clinical test for the determination of anterior cruciate ligament integrity.# The knee is flexed at 20-30 degrees# Examiner pulls on the tibia to assess the amount of anterior motion of the tibia in comparison to the femur# An ACL-deficient knee will demonstrate increased forward translation of the tibia at the conclusion of the movementPivot shift test# Test to asses ACL injuryPerson lies on one side of the body# Knee is extended and internally rotated# Surgeon applies stress to lateral side of the knee, while the knee is being flexed# A crash felt at 30 degrees flexion indicates positive test.Some clinical Orthopedic tests:DeQuervain's diseaseFinkelstein's testAnterior shoulder instabilityJobe's testSubscapularis injuryLift off testAcromioclavicular joint pathology and Labral tearsO'Brien's active compression testHip dysplasiaBarlow's maneuver, Ortolani testHip Impingement (Femoroacetabular Impingement)Flexion, Adduction and Internal Rotation (F-Ad-lr) testLow back painWaddell's signsLow back flexibilityOtt test, Schober testIliotibial Band SyndromeOber's testSacroiliitisLarrey's signBest clinical test to diagnose ACL tearLachman testACL tearPivot shift test, Anterior drawer testMeniscus injuryApley grind test, McMurray testMedial meniscus, MCL and ACL tearO' Donoghue's triadMeniscal tearThessaly TestTendo Achilles ruptureThompson/ Simond's testWatson's testInstability between the scaphoid and lunate bones of the wrist.Meniscal injury:# A twisting injury which is the common mechanism of injury in sports tackles involving the legs usually leads to a meniscal tear.# Injury to the medial meniscus is far more common than lateral meniscal injury. This is due to the medial meniscus being less mobile and thinner anteriorly.# Healing may be slow especially if the tear involves the deeper/inner 2/3 where there is a poor blood supply compared to the superficial/outer l/3rd.# Treatment:a) Conservative - Analgesia, supportive treatmentb) Surgical - Repair of meniscus, meniscectomy",
