Then a below - knee plaster cast us usually sufficient . the cast is changed every 2 weeks , & continued until it is possible to overcorrect all deformities .once this happens foot is kept in corrected position by maintenance device. *ponsetti philosophy - the calcaneo- cuboid - navicular complex is internally rotated under plantarflexed talus , hence the deformity can be corrected back under talus by gradually stretching the tight structures . This is done by putting thumb pressure under talus .By doing so the calcaneo- cuboid- navicular complex is externally rotated under the talar head .treatment is staed within 1st week of life .cavus aspect of deformity is corrected first ,followed by adduction ,then varus & lastly equinus .after each correction above knee pop is applied , which is changed every 5-7 days .Possible to correct all components within 6weeks.Equinus deformity is often under corrected , can be treated by percutaneous tenotomy of tendoachilles .
