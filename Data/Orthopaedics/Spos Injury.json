Selective sectioning of the ACL has shown that the anteromedial band is tight in flexion, providing the primary restraint, whereas the posterolateral bulky poion of this ligament is tight in extension. The posterolateral bundle provides the principal resistance for hyperextension. Thus complete tear will have instability in both flexion and extension.
