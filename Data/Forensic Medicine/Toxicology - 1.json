Shellfish such as mussels, scallops, and oysters may be a major source of dietary cadmium, and may contain 100 to 1,000 mcg/kg. Cadmium's toxic effects may be due to the displacement or substitution of cadmium for zinc in critical metabolic processes. Cadmium interferes with the uptake, distribution and action of zinc. The kidney accumulates cadmium over a lifetime. Renal damage occur once the cadmium concentration exceeds about 200 micrograms per gram of kidney weight. Nausea, metallic taste, salivation, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and myalgia. Sudden muscle cramps can cause the victim to cry out in pain periodically (Itai-Itai disease, or Ouch-Ouch disease).
