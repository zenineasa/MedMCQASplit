Principle: Blood serum contains proteins in colloidal suspension ,and when human serum is injected into an animal,the animal become immunised against these proteins and antibodies develop in its blood .If human serum is then brought into contact with this animal serum,the antibodies in the animal serum react with the proteins in the human serum and a visible precipitate forms. The antibodies causing this reaction are known as precipitins and the animal serum is known as antihumam precipitin serum.A rabbit or a fowl is injected with human blood every third day for 3 to 5 injections. after thuis animal is killed and the antiserum is collected. A suitable antiserum should react immmediately or within a minute on the 1:1000 dilution Application of the test: It is a specific protein test, and the reaction demonstrates the presence of albuminous substances obtained from any pa of human body. the origin of skin, flesh,bone or even secretions such as saliva ,milk and semen is determined by this test.",

Five to ten ml of normal saline solution is placed in the vagina with a syringe. The fluid is then removed and placed in a sealed tube and refrigerated for enzyme examination. Concentration in excess of hundred Bodansky units with or without motile sperms indicate that ejaculation occurred within twelve hours of examination. Dried seminal stains which have not undergone putrefaction retain acid phosphatase activity for weeks or months, although enzymatic activity decreases slowly with time.

Fist, foot or an instrument, such as lathi, metal or wooden bars, whips, belts, cycle chains, etc., are used. The usual target is the back, but injuries may be seen on almost any pa of the body. Abrasions, contusions, lacerations and fractures may be found. Bruises in abdominal wall and rupture of internal organs may be seen. Poking with stick, baton, rod, etc. is common. (2) Falanga (faiaka, bastinado): In this canes or rods are used to beat on the soles of the feet, or rarely to the palms of the hands or hips, which is very painful and debilitating. Contusions are found deep in the tissues. Faint red lines may be seen, and often hyperpigmentation along the lines of injury. Aseptic necrosis may occur. (3) Telefono: It consists of repeated slapping of the sides of the head (over ears) by the open palms of the assailant. This may cause rupture of ear drums and injury to the inner ear.

The classic type is most commonly seen in chronically ill patients, alcoholics, very young patients, the elderly, or morbidly obese people in hot or humid weather.

TESTS FOR DETERMINING ABO GROUPING IN BLOOD STAINS : (1) TUBE METHOD : A drop of washed suspension of red cells is added to equal volumes of each of the antisera of A, B and 0 in separate tubes. The blood group can be identified when agglutination is seen by naked eye or microscope in the tubes. (2) Tile Method: A porcelian tile is used instead of tubes. (3) ABSORPTION -INHIBITION METHOD : The sample and antisera are allowed to react with each other for a longer period. ( 4) MIXED AGGLUTINATION TEST : The sample piece of stained cloth is cut into pieces of 2 to 3 mm and the fibres are separated and added to tubes along with antisera of A, B, 0 types. The group can be known by the antisera which clumped to the cloth fibres. (5) ABSORPTION-ELUTION TECHNIQUE: Test is similar to mixed agglutination, but the clumps are seen on the walls of the test tube and not on fibres. This test can be used for body tissues also. Blood stains can be typed for the presence of ABO agglutinogens by absorption-elution, absorption- inhibition, mixed agglutination or ELISA method, or for agglutinins by the Lattes crust method.
