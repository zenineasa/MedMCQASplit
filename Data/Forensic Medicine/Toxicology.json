Accumulation of formic acid results in lactic acidosis/high anion gap metabolic acidosis with low plasma bicarbonates, blindness due to retinal damage, papilledema and optic atrophy.* Symptoms of poisoning are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, headache, abdominal pain, respiratory depression, cyanosis, acute tubular necrosis, hypothermia, fixed dilated pupils, visual distrubance (blurring of vision; photophobia) and odor of spirit in breath. Fatal dose in adults is 60-240 ml in adults, but as little as 15 ml can cause blindness.* Methanol poisoning can be treated by supportive measures, gastric lavage and sodium bicarbonate (to treat acidosis) ethanol is useful because it competitively inhibits the conversion of methanol to formic acid. Fomepizole can also be used as it is a specific inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. Folic acid or folinic acid enhance the metabolism of formic acid to C02.

Siddhi or Bhang or sabji-- from dried leaves and fruit shoots.- Mildest and contain 15% of active principle.- Fatal dose: 10g/kg.6- (2). Majoon -- sweet prepared with Bhang.- Increases appetite and sex desire.- (3). Ganja (marihuana)-- from flower tops of the female plant.- contain 15-25% of active principle.- Used for smoking in cigarettes, which contain 0.3-0.6 g cannabis and are known as Reefer/joint.- Fatal dose: 8 g/kg 6- (4). Charas or Hashish-- It is the resin (dope or shit).- Contains 25 - 40 % of the active principle.6- Fatal dose: 2 g/kg 6# Fatal dose:- THC 30 mg/kg.# Intoxication:- Feeling of detachment, clarity, cleverness, disinhibition, depersonalisation, euphoria, elation, relaxation, well- being, dreaminess, sleepiness, jocularity, laughing, rapidly changing emotions.- Irrelevant though processes.- Sensory novelty and increased,awareness of stimuli.- Speech changes.- \"Bad trip\": due to distortion of perception, the users feel that they could fly from high windows or stop passing buses with bare hands.- Increased appetite and thurst, tachycardia, restlessness, dry mouth, urinary frequency, injected conjunctiva.# Rx:- Stomach wash or emesis.- 100 ml of 50% glucose, 2 mg naloxone, and 100 mg thiamine i.v.- 5-10 mg diazepam if violent.- If flashbacks occur give anti-anxiety and if required anti-psychotic like haloperidol.# Chronic poisoning:- In chronic Cases the patient may run amok i.e he develops a psychic disturbance marked by a period of depression, followed by violent attempts to kill persons (impulse to murder). In the end he may kill himself or surrender voluntarilyAdditional Educational points: Q.Ans.1Cannabis is chronic users leads to\"Run Amok\"2Cocaine leads toFormication/Magnan's symptoms or Cocaine Bugs.3Speed ball isCombination of cocaine & heroin.4Rave drug'Ecstasy (Methylenedioxymthamphetamine/ MDMA).5\"Road poison\"Dhatura (delirient poison).6Cardiac PoisonsNicotine, digitalis, oleander, quinine, aconite (mitha zeher) and Cyanide.7Strychnine is an example ofSpinal Poison.89Ergotism is called asMnemonic for Atropine toxicity featuresSt.Anthony's Fire - burning pain in limbs.# Hot as a Hare# Blind as a bat# Dry as a bone# Red as a beet# Mad as a Hen.",

They are seen in chronic mercury poisoning. In severe form, patient becomes unable to dress, write or walk, i.e. concussio mercuralis (shaking palsy).* Metallic mercury (para or quick silver) is not poisonous on ingestion, as it is not absorbed. But its vapours are poisonous. Mercuric compounds being soluble are more poisonous than mercurous compounds. Mercuric chloride (HgCl2), also called corrosive sublimate or perchloride of mercury, is most poisons salt of mercury.* Acute poisoning presents with syncope, convulsions general instability and nephrotoxicity (proximal tubular). The mouth, tongue and fauces become corroded and appears grayish white.* Signs and symptoms of chronic mercury poisoning are :1) Excessive salivation, metallic taste, loosening of teeth, and blue black lining on gums (similar to lead poisoning).2) Diphtheria like membranous colitis and dysentery.3) Anorexia, insomnia, sweating, nause, irritability and photophobia.4) Special features are :i) Mercuria lentis: Brownish deposition of mercury on anterior lens capsule.ii) Tremors : There are moderately coarse, intentional tremors starting in fingers and hands, and legs. They are also called Danbury tremors or hatter's shake or glass blower's shake. In severe form, patient becomes unable to dress, write or walk, i.e. concussio mercuralis (shaking palsy).iii) Erethism (neuropsychiatric changes): The personality disturbance is characterized by shyness, irritability, tremors, loss of memory and insomnia. There may be depression, delusion, hallucination and MDP (mad hatter).iv) Acrodynia (Pink desease): This is idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction with a generalized pinkish rash described as 5P : pinkish, puffy, painful, paraesthetic hands and peeling of skin.v) Minimata disease: It is due to organic mercury poisoning due to eating fish poisoned by mercury.vi) Membranous glomerulopathy.",

Lead poisoning may be acute or chronic.oOne manifestation of chronic lead toxicity is the rheumatologic entity known as saturnine gout.oIllicitly distilled beverages may inadvertently contain harmful toxins, like metallic lead.oLead has been known to play a role in purine metabolism & renal insufficiency.CARDINAL SYMPTOMS OF LEAD INTOXICATIONAcuteChronic*. GI effects-. colic, severe pain-. severe constipation*. Peripheral, central neuropathy*. Cardiac toxicity*. Acute encephalopathy*. Chronic nephropathy*. Acute nephropathy*. Saturnine gout*. In Children*. Reproductive effects*. Growth retardation*. Hypertension?*. Behavioural problems* Anemia[?]Chronic Lead Poisoning or Plumbism or Saturnism:oChronic lead poisoning results from a daily intake of one to two mg. of lead; Lead vapour is more dangerous than dust & it is a typical cumulative poison.[?]Signs and Symptoms of Chronic Lead Poisoning:oFacial Pallor: mouth is one of the earliest and most consistent sign due to vasospasm.oAnaemia: There may be polycythaemia with polychromatophilia in early stages, but later there is anaemia which is associated with polychromasia, punctate basophilia, reticulocytosis, poikilocytosis, anisocytosis, nucleated red cells (sideroblasts) and an increase in mononuclear cells, whereas polymorphonuclear cells and platelets are decreased.-Anaemia is probably due to decreased survival time of red blood cells and inhibition of haeme synthesis by interference with the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin.-Punctate basophilia or basophilic stippling means the presence of many dark blue-coloured pinhead sized spots in the cytoplasm of red blood cells, due to toxic action of lead on porphyrin metabolism.-Reticulocytes and basophilic stippled cells result from the inhibition of 5 pyrimidine nucleotidase, an impaired ability to rid the cell of RNA degradation products and the aggregation of ribosome.-Eosinophilia is more common than basophilic stippling. Porphyrins excreted in urine may be 500 micrograms per day.oLead Line: A stippled blue line, called Burtonian line, is seen on the gums in 50 to 70% of cases. It appears due to subepithelial deposit of granules at the junction with teeth, only near dirty or carious teeth, within a week of exposure, especially on upper jaw. It is due to formation of lead sulphide by the action of hydrogen sulphide formed by decomposed food in the mouth.-A similar blue line may be seen in cases of poisoning by mercury, copper, bismuth, iron and silver.oColic and Constipation: It is usually later symptom. Colic of intestines, ureters, uterus and blood vessels occur in 85% of cases. The colic occurs at night and the pain may be very severe.-Individual attacks last only a few minutes, but may recur for several days or weeks. Constipation is usual but diarrhoea or vomiting may occur.oLead Palsy: It usually occurs late, and is seen in less than 10% of cases.-There may be tremors, numbness, hyperaesthesia, and cramps before the actual muscle weakness. It is commoner in adults than in children, and men are particularly affected.-Muscle groups affected are those most prone to fatigue. Usually the extensor muscles of the wrist (wrist drop; radial nerve is affected), are affected, but the deltoid, biceps, anterior tibial (foot drop), and rarely muscles of eye or intrinsic muscles of hand or foot are affected.-Paralysis is associated with degeneration of the nerve and atrophy of the muscles.-Recovery may be complete but is usually slow.oEncephalopathy: Lead encephalopathy, in some form is said to be present in almost every case of plumbism. It is common in children often associated with tetraethyl lead.-Symptoms are vomiting, headache, insomnia, visual disturbances, irritability, restlessness, delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, coma and death. Lead encephalopathy is usually irreversible and about 85% have permanent brain damage.-Death occurs in about 25% cases.oCardiovascular System and Kidneys: Lead causes vascular constriction, leading to hypertension and permanent arteriolar degeneration. Chronic arteriosclerotic nephritis and interstitial nephritis occur.oReproductive System: Menstrual derangements, such as amenorrhoea, dysmenonhoea, I menorrhagia, sterility of both sexes, and abortion are, frequent. Abortion occurs in pregnant women between 3 to 6 months.oOther Systems: They are dyspepsia, anorexia, emaciation, general weakness, exhaustion, irritability, foul breath, headache, vertigo, loss of hair and drowsiness. Peripheral neuritis is rare. Retinal stippling is noticed by ophthalmoscopic examination showing presence of greyish glistening lead particles in the early phase of poisoning.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Mercury Acrodynia or pink disease:* It is thought to be an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction particularly seen in children. This can be caused by chronic mercury exposure in any form usually in children.* The onset is insidious with anorexia, insomnia, sweating, skin rash and photophobia.* Hands and feet become puffy, pinkish, painful, paraesthetic with peeling of skin.* Teeth may be shed.* Metallic mercury (para or quick silver) is not poisonous on ingestion, as it is not absorbed. But its vapours are poisonous. Mercuric compounds being soluble are more poisonous than mercurous compounds. Mercuric chloride (HgCl2), also called corrosive sublimate or perchloride of mercury, is most poisons salt of mercury.* Acute poisoning presents with syncope, convulsions general instability and nephrotoxicity (proximal tubular). The mouth, tongue and fauces become corroded and appears grayish white.* Signs and symptoms of chronic mercury poisoning are :1) Excessive salivation, metallic taste, loosening of teeth, and blue black lining on gums (similar to lead poisoning).2) Diphtheria like membranous colitis and dysentery.3) Anorexia, insomnia, sweating, nause, irritability and photophobia.4) Special features are :i) Mercuria lentis: Brownish deposition of mercury on anterior lens capsule.ii) Tremors : There are moderately coarse, intentional tremors starting in fingers and hands, and legs. They are also called Danbury tremors or hatter's shake or glass blower's shake. In severe form, patient becomes unable to dress, write or walk, i.e. concussio mercuralis (shaking palsy).iii) Erethism (neuropsychiatric changes): The personality disturbance is characterized by shyness, irritability, tremors, loss of memory and insomnia. There may be depression, delusion, hallucination and MDP (mad hatter).iv) Acrodynia (Pink desease): This is idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction with a generalized pinkish rash described as 5P : pinkish, puffy, painful, paraesthetic hands and peeling of skin.v) Minimata disease: It is due to organic mercury poisoning due to eating fish poisoned by mercury.vi) Membranous glomerulopathy.",
