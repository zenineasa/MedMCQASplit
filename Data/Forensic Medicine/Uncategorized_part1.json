B: Pressure Abrasion Teeth marks in biting and ligature marks in hanging and strangulation are example of imprint, pressure or contact abrasion Abrasion It as also known as - Graze or Scratch or Impression. An abrasion is a superficial injury to the skin which involves the loss of superficial epithelial layer (Uppermost layers of the cells of skin) of skin. Abrasions are produced by ? - Blow - Fall on some rough and hard substance - Dragging as in vehicular accidents. - Scratching with finger nails, bites and thorns etc. - Friction on some hard substance. Pressure of rope or cord as is found in strangulation and hanging etc. - Rubbing. - Indenting of the objects. Varieties of Abrasions Scratches- They are due to a sharp or a pointed object pressing across the skin, moving the surface layers in front of it and causing the heaping up of layers of skin. Grazes- They are modified scratches. - In this, the broader surface of skin comes in contact with the uneven rough object. - In this, the depth may vary at different places. - The direction is indicated by presence of clean commencement and tag at the finishing end. Impact Abrasions/Pressure Abrasions - They are also known as \"Imprint abrasions\". - They are caused by the stamping of some object against the skin like radiators of cars in vehicular accidents or - They may be caused by pressure on the skin which is accompanied by movements as found in? Ligature in cases of hanging or strangulation. Injuries caused by lashes with whip Sites of Abrasions ? The abrasions resulting from friction against rough surface during a fall are generally found on the bony pas and are accompanied with contusions or lacerations The abrasions caused by finger nails are seen on the exposed of body like - Face near forearm, hands, thighs etc. They are cresentric in shape, when finger nails are used. Ecchymosis is a common accompaniment. The abrasions caused by teeth bite are elliptical or circular in shape and often present separate marks. Typical impression of teeth by different sets of teeth (Deciduous or permanent) is marked. The intervening area is only a bruised area. The abrasions from radiators are honey-comb in appearance and are .commonly found in vehicular accidents Difference between Antemoem and Postmoem Bruise Antemoem abrasions will show signs of inflammation and repair whereas these will be absent in postmoem abrasions.",

Thus detecting the presence of air in stomach and intestine (positive test) proves live bih (even in absence of positive hydrostatic lung test if there had been some obstruction in respiratory However, negative test (absence of air in stomach and bowel) does not always mean still-bih since air does not necessarily enter stomach in adequate amounts during act of breathing. Procedure: The stomach and intestine are removed separately after tying double ligature at each end, place them both in water. They float in water if respiration has taken place, otherwise they will sink No medicolegal value Because air may be swallowed by child in attempting to free the air passage of fluid obstruction in case of still-bih. It is useless in putrefaction Other Tests in Infanticide For Lungs Static test or Fodere's testa: Weight of lung before (30-40 g) and after 66 gm) is measured. The increase in weight of lung is due to increased blood flow Ploucquet's testa: Weight of lung is doubled after respiration (Before respiration-1/70 of body weight, after respiration-1/35 of body weight) Hydrostatic test (Raygat's test)a: It is based on a fact that on breathing, the volume of lungs is increased, which more than compensates the weight of additional blood, due to which their specific gravity is diminished. For Middle Ear Werdin's test: Before bih, the middle ear contains gelatinous embryonic connective tissue. With respiration, the sphincter at the pharyngeal end of eustachian tube relaxes and air replaces the gelatinous substance in few hours to five weeks. This is not reliable",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Vagal inhibition Types of drowning Drowning is classified as (1) typical and (2) atypical. 1. Typical drowning (wet drowning) Typical drowning refers to obstruction of air passages and lungs by inhalation of water or other fluid. Therefore it is also called wet drowning and findings offluid and froth are present in PM examination. Typical drowning may be :- Fresh water drowning : In fresh water drowning large quantities of water cross the alveolar membrane into circulation causing hypervolaemia and hemodilution. RBCs imbibe water and burst (hemolysis) with liberation of potossium. Therefore, hea is exposed to volume overload, potassium excess, sodium deficit (hyponatremia), and anoxia. Anoxia and hyperkalemia cause ventricular fibrillation and death in 4-5 minutes. Salt water drowning : Hypeonicity of inhaled water causes loss of fluid from circulation into the lungs giving rise fulminating pulmonary edema with progressive hypovolaemia, circulatary shock, and eventually cardiac standstill (asystole) with death in 8-12 minutes. 2. Atypical drowning It refers to drowning in which even after submersion of body in water, little or no water anters respiratory passages and lungs. Hence typical findings of wet drowning in the form of froth and oedema aquosum of lungs are not found. Atypical drowning may be :- Dry drowning : On contact with water, especially cold water, there results intense laryngospasm, so that water does not enter the lungs. Death is due to asphyxia because of laryngospasm. Immersion syndrome (hydrocution/submersion inhibition/vagal inhibition) : Sudden death occurs due to vagal inhibition as a result of (a) sudden impact with cold water, (b) duck diving (falling in water with feet first), and (c) horizontal entry in water with impact on epigastrium. Submersion of unconscious : If person is unconscious since before submersion in water, little or no water enters respiratory passages. It may occur in MI, cerebrovascular accident, hypeension, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm and in drunk state. Near drowning (secondary drowning syndrome/post immersion syndrome) : In this drowning is survived and death occurs at a later stage after removal from water. Either the person himself comes out of water or he is recovered alive, but due to complications of submersion, he dies at a later stage. It is due to hypoxic encephalopathy and fibrosing alveolitis. The death occurs due to combined effect of cerebral hypoxia, pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonitis, electrolyte disturbances and metabolic acidosis.",

These clauses are not mutually exclusive for there can be injuries which may fall in more than one clause. However, the list is exhaustive in the sense that, the framers of the Code have used the term \"only\", while listing the type of hus which they designated as \"grievous\". This positively shows that the list is exhaustive and no hu outside the list given in S. 320 can be termed as 'grievous hu'. The following kinds of hu only are designated as \"grievous\" Emasculation. Permanent privation of the sight of either eye. Permanent privation of the hearing of either ear Privation of any member or joint. Destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or joint. Permanent disfiguration of the head or face. Fracture or dislocation of a bone or tooth. Any hu which endangers life or which causes the sufferer to be during the space of twenty days in severe bodily pain or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. Where injury was caused on the abdomen with a sharp edged weapon and the doctor had stated that the injury had penetrated the abdominal cavity but had not involved any vital organs/ impoant structures, but had just touched the stomach, it was held that the accused had caused only simple hu. Similarly, cutting of a tendon or a muscle does not make the injury fall under purview of any clauses of S 320 IPC.

Width of injury is more than the thickness of blade, due to gaping of wound. Langer's line of skin determines gaping : gaping is more when cut is across these lines Margins are eveed, clear, and clean cut Clean incised wounds heal by primary intention, whereas diy, infected or large wounds heal by secondary intention, with scar formation.

Static test or Fodere's test : The average weight ofboth lungs before respiration is 30-40 gm and after respiration is 60-70 cm. Hydrostatic test (Raygat's test, I\" life test) : The specific gravity of a non-respired lung is 1040-1050 and of a respired lung is 940-950, so, after respiration lung floats on water (specific gravity of water is 1000). False positive hydrostatic test may occur (i.e.non-respired lung may float) in decomposition and in attempted aificial respiration. False negative hydrostatic test (i.e. respired lung may sink down) may occur in atelectasis, pulmonary oedema, bronchopneumonia, and congenital syphylis. Breslau's second life test : It assumes that a live born child would respire and therefore, would also swallow some air into the stomach and bowel. Hence they float on water.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Exhibitionism Incent means sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is closely related to him by blood. eg a daughter, granddaughter. Sexual perversions -These are persistently indulged sexual acts in which complete satisfaction is sought and obtained without sexual intercourse. These include :? a) Sadism : Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on one's paner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc. b) Lust murder : In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm. c) Necrophagia : (Necros =corpse; phagia = to eat) : This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure. d) Masochism : Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, toured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual paner. e) Necrophilia : In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants. f) Fetishism : A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetishism means the use of such objects of sexual gratification leading to orgasm. eg underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc. g) Transvestism = Fonism: A transvestite (trans = opposite, vista = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire of being identified with the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interest, and associations are all designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. There is no hormonal disturbance or genital abnormality. h) Masturbation = Onanism = Ipsation is the deliberate self-stimulation that effects sexual arousal. In males, it is done by moving the penis against a bed or other object. In females, finges are gently and rhythmically moved over clitoris or labia minora or steady pressure is applied over these pas with several fingers or whole hands (it is an offence when done in public). i) Exhibitionism (Sec 294 IPC): It is a willful and intentional exposure of the genitalia in a public place while in the presence of others to obtain sexual pleasure. May or may not be associated with masturbation (punishment = 3 months + fine). j) Voyeurism = Scoptophilia = Peeping tom : Sexual gratification is obtained by looking at the sexual organs of other persons, watching the act of sexual intercourse, or witnessing undressing by a woman. k) Frotteurism : Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing against persons in crowd. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone. l) Undinism : In this, the sexual pleasure is often obtained by witnessing the act of urination by someone of the same or opposite sex. m) Indecent assault (Sec 354 IPC) is any offence committed on a female with the intention or knowledge to outrage her modesty. Usually, the act involves the sexual pa of either or is sexually ored. In such assaults, a man may try to kiss a woman, press or fondle with her breasts, touch or expose the genitalia or thighs, try to put a finger in her vagina, play with vulva. A medical practitioner can be accused of indecent assault if he examines a female patient by stripping her clothes without her consent or even with her consent in the absence of a female attendant. Such assaults are punishable under Sec 354 IPC, upto 2 years imprisonment and/or fine. n) Uranism : General term for perversion of the sexual instinct. o) Satyriasis : Incessant sexual desire. p) Priapism : Painful penile erection in absence of sexual desire.",

According to this test, if death occured in salt water, the blood chloride concentration was greater in the left hea chambers when compared to right due to hemoconcentration. If death occured in fresh water, the blood chloride concentration was greater in the right hea chambers due to hemodilution. Diatom test can be used to differentiate between drowning and non drowning cases. According to this test if a person dies from drowning in water containing diatoms, it can be demonstrated in the lung parenchyma and in distant organs such as hea, brain, kidney and bone. Whereas if a dead body is immersed in water, diatoms can be demonstrated only in the lung parnchyma and not in other organs. Because diatoms reach the lungs by passive percolation but not to distant organs because of absent circulation.

        "question": "In civil negligence, onus of proof lies on",
        "exp": "Patient [Ref- Reddy's Forensic 29/e p30; Parikh 6/e p1.441 \"Generally speaking, it is for the patient in an action for negligence to establish the guilt of the doctor, whose innocence is otherwise assumed.\"- Parikh However, in cases where the rule of res ipso loguitur is applied, the patient need not prove negligence. Res ipso loquitur means that \"the thing or fact speaks for itself.\" The patient has to merely state what according to him was the act of negligence. The 3 essential conditions considered necessary for res ipsa loquitur are: The nature of injury suggests by common knowledge or expe evidence that without negligence it does not occur. The patient must not contribute to his own injury The doctor had exclusive control over the injury producing instrument or treatment. Professional negligence Professional negligence is defined as absence of reasonable care and skill, or wilful negligence of a medical practioner in the treatment of a patient, which causes bodily injury or death of the patient. The word negligence is defined as the omission to do something (act of omission) which a reasonable person would do, or doing something (act of commission) which a reasonable person would not do. To prove an act of negligence the onus lies on the patient (or his relative if the patient has died). Following conditions must be proved by the patient (4Ds): Duty- the doctor (defendant) owed him a duty of care. Dereliction- the doctor failed to perfonn that duty. Damage- the patient suffered actual damage due to negligence of the doctor. iv. Direct causation- the doctor's negligence directly led to the damage without any other intervening cause. Professional negligence can be of 2 types: Civil negligence and Criminal negligence. Civil negligence Civil negligence arises - when a patient (or his relative, in case of patient's death) files suit in a civil cou to get compensation from his doctor for the injury or death of the patient due to doctor's negligence. - a doctor files civil suit to get fees from his patient, who refuses to pay alleging negligence. Criminal negligence Criminal negligence arises when the degree of negligence is so grave that it goes beyond matters of comensation. Case is filed in a criminal cou. Criminal negligence occurs when the doctor shows gross lack of competence, or gross inaction, gross recklessness, gross negligence in selection and application of remedies. It involves extreme depaure from the ordinary standard of care. Criminal negligence cases are very rare. Note that- A doctor will not be criminally liable if a patient dies due to an error of judgement or carelessness or want of due caution, though lie can be liable to pay compensation. Examples of criminal negligence? - Amputation of wrong limb or digit or of the wrong patient. - Leaving instruments, tubes, sponges or swabs within the body. - Gross mismanagement under the influence of alcohol or drugs - Performing criminal aboion - Administration of a wrong substance into the eye causing loss of vision. - Giving wrong or infected blood. - Gangrene after too tight plastering. Note that? Even if a doctor is negligent, a patient is not entitled for any compensation if no damage has occurred. An error in diagnosis or treatment is not negligence provided proper care and skill has been exercised. Contributory negligence is not a defence in criminal negligence. (Contributory negligence is any negligence on the pa of the patient or his attendant, which along with the doctor's negligence, contributed to the injury) Criminal negligence cases are dealt under I.P.C. section 304A.",

This enzyme, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide conves colourless salts into coloured bases. Thus these tests are based on H2O2 and peroxidase enzyme. Tests are :- i) Benzidine test : Greenish blue colour. Phenolphthalein test (kastle myere test) : Deep permanganate colour. Leucomalachite green test : Bluish green or peacock blue colour. Guaiacum test : Blue colour. Ohotoludine test (kohn test) : Blue or green colour. Amidopyrine test : Purple colour. 2) Microchemical tests These tests are based on propey of haem pa of hemoglobin to form characteristic coloured crystals. The tests are :? Teichmann's haemin crystal test. Takayama hemochromogen crystal test. Luminal spray test: It is especially useful in old obscure blood stains. 3) Spetroscopy It is most delicate and reliable test. It is based on the principle that hemoglobin and its derivatives give characteristic absorption bands when viewed through a spectroscope.",

        "exp": "B i.e. Section 174 Cr Pc Autopsy (in general) should only be conducted when there is an official order authorizing the autopsy. Authorisation (an official order) for a medicolegal autopsy is given by Coroner, police or MagistrateQ. Inquest (in dowry daths) should be conducted by a Magistrate (section 176 (1) CrPC) or police officer not below the rank of Dy SP (deputy superintendent of police). In all cases of unnatural death of a female with in 7 years of marriage or if she is below the age of 30 years, autopsy has been made compulsory (section 174 (3) CrPC) and it has to he carried out by 2 medical officers in cases of death due to burns. So the facts written above make it very clear that both police officer (above Dy SP) and Magistrate can investigate (inqueset) a dowry death case; and both can authorize autopsy. But it is the section 176 (1) CrPC which orders Magistrate inquest (and thus authorizing magistrate for autopsy) ; whereas section 174 (3) CrPC makes autopsy compulsory in every case of dowry death and a death of < 30 years of female.",

These offences are sodomy, buccal coitus, tribadism (lesbianism), and bestiality. Sodomy Sodomy is sexual intercourse through anus. It is of two types : Homosexual and Heterosexual. In Homosexual, it is done by a male on another male. Heterosexual sodomy is anal intercourse with a women. The person who does the act is known as active agent and the person, on whom the act is done, is known as passive agent. if the passive agent is adult/elderly the act is known as Gerontophilia. If the passive agent in sodomy is a child, act is called Paederasty, the passive agent is labelled as catamite, and the active agent is known as Paedophile. Examination findings of sodomy are :- In active agent : (i) Peculiar smell of anal gland secretion on penis, (ii) Fecal soiling, lubricant (if used) and blood on penis, (iii) Penis shaft is elongated and constricted in habitual sodomites with consequent twisting/ angulation of urethra, (iv) Abrasions on prepuce and glans penis, tearing of frenulum, swelling and redness of penis. In passive agent : Passive agent may be :? 1) Habitual : (i) Funnel shaped anus with deeply situated anal opening, (ii) Dilatation and laxity of anal sphincter, (iii) Shaved anal skin, (iv) Anal fissures and piles, (v) Lateral buttock truction test positive: On applying lateral traction on anus in normal person, there will be reflex contraction of anus, but in habitual sodomine there is comple relaxation of sphincter with dilatation of opening. 2) Non-habitual (forcibly victimized) : (i) Presence of semen in anus is the only confirmatety evidence, (ii) Signs of violence around anus, i.e. abrasions, fisures, contusion or triangular bruised tear of posterior pa of anus (in sudden violence). Other unnatural sexual offences Bestiality : is the sexual intercourse by a human being with a lower animal. Tribadism (Lesbianism or female homosexuality) : Sexual gratification of a women is obtained by another woman by kissing, body contact, manipulation of breast and genitalia. Active paner is called dyke or butch and the passive agent is called femme. This is not an offence in India. o Buccal coitus (coitus per as/sin of gomorrah) : In this, the male organ is introduced into mouth, usually of a young child.

        "exp": "Ans. B: Suicidal deaths Hesitation cuts derive their name from the hesitation with which these incisions are inflicted by a person intending to commit suicide by a cutting instrument. The preliminary cuts are known as tentative cuts Hesitation cuts are not found in homicidal assaults Hesitation/ tentative wounds They are defined either as: any cut or wound that is self-inflicted after a decision is made not to commit suicide, or any tentative cut or wound that is made before the final cut that causes death. Such wounds are usually superficial, sharp, forced skin cuts found on the body of victims. These less severe cutting marks are often caused by attempts to build up courage before attempting the final, fatal wound. Non-fatal, shallow hesitation wounds can also accompany the deeper, sometimes fatal incisions. Although hesitation cuts are not always present in cases of suicide, they are typical of suicidal injuries. However, the presence of hesitation marks alongside or near to the final fatal mark usually indicates a forensic diagnosis of suicide over other possible causes of death. Hesitation wounds are generally straight-line marks at the elbows, neck/throat, and wrists, although in a few cases they occur in the general area of the upper middle pa of the abdomen (near the hea). Wounds made by people attempting suicide are typically made at an angle related to the hand that holds the weapon. The angle of such hesitation wounds is usually in a downward flowing direction because of the natural motion of the arm as it sweeps across the body. Hesitation wounds are often made under clothing, with paicular pas of the clothing being paed to expose the target area of the body. Instruments used to inflict hesitation wounds are generally those found around the living quaers of the person attempting suicide. Such instruments include kitchen knives, single-edge and double-edge knifes, pocket knives, hatchets, razor blades, screwdrivers, and other sharp objects. People who have previously attempted suicide, but have not succeeded in their endeavor, will often carry visible scars from hesitation wounds.",

In shotgun these are lead shots and pellets (recently steel is also used instead of lead) and in rifled weapons (pistal, rifle, revolver), these are bullets. Tip of the bullet is knwon as nose. Varieties of bullets are :- Incendiary (igniting) bullet : The tip of bullet contains self igniting material e.g. barium nitrate and powdered aluminium and magnesium (in the past, phosphorus was used), so that it catches fire on hitting the target. It is used to cause fire in usually inflammable targets like fuel tanks (of air crafts etc). Explosive bullet : The tip contains a detonator or lead azide, so that the bullet explodes on hitting the target. Dum-dum bullet (expanding bullet): It is a jacketed bullet with is nose tip chiseled or cut off. It is designed to increase in diameter and expand upon striking the target, thus producing larger diameter wounds of limited penetration. Tandem bullet (Piggey tail bullet) : It is called one-behind-other bullet because two bullets are ejected one after the other, when first bullet failed to leave the burrel and is ejected by subsequently fired bullet. Therefore, both enter body through same enterance wound (some times, they may enter through different entries), but the wounds of exit are always two. Tandem (Duplex) caridge is one in which two bullets are present in same caridge. It is used in military rifles. Tracer bullet: It leaves a trace in atmosphere along the path so that a person (gunner) can observe the strike. Burning of barium nitrate produces flame and powdered magnesium along with strontium nitrate are added to give red color to the flame. Tumbling bullet : One that rotates in end on end during its motion. Yawning bullet : One which travels in an irregular fashion and causes a key hole entery wound. Yaw means detion between long axis of bullet and the axis of path of bullet. Souvenir bullet : A bullet left in body for long time and is surrounded by fibrous tissue. Frangile bullet : Designed to fragment upon impact. Mushrooming of bullet : A soft nose bullet, an hitting the target may get deformed to assume the shape of a mushroom.",

The presentation of the teenager in the question is typical for salicylate poisoning, including poisoning with aspirin. Fatalities are typically due to dehydration and hypokalemia. In contrast to the acute toxicity of salicylates, acetaminophen poisoning produces nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and shock in some cases; it can cause irreversible hepatic failure (which can be prevented or ameliorated by administration of N-acetylcysteine) 2-6 days after ingestion. Carbon monoxide causes hypoxia, and a cherry red coloration of the lips and mucous membranes may be evident. Lead and mercury poisoning are both usually seen in their chronic forms, although mercury ingestion can produce an acute toxicity with renal tubular necrosis and necrosis of gastrointestinal epithelium. Chronic lead poisoning can cause anemia (with basophilic stippling of RBCs), neuropathy, and abdominal pain. Ref: Corbridge T., Murray P., Mokhlesi B. (2005). Chapter 102. Toxicology in Adults.

Thus mummification occurs in deses, especially in summer and also in bodies buried in shallow grave in sandy soil. Mummification is characterized by dessication or drying of the dead body. There is drying, dehydration and shriveling of dead body. It proceeds from exterior to interior. Therefore first to be involved is skin, especially of exposed body pas like lips, nose tip, hands (fingers) and feet (toes). The skin is shrunken, contracted, dry, brittle, leathery, streched across bony prominences and rusty brown to black in color. Internal viscera also dry up, darken in color and blend with each other to form a single mass. Body emits smell like rotten cheese. Facial features and injuries are well preserved, thus identification of body and cause of death can be determined (like adipocere formation).

B: Lightning stroke An almost pathognomonic cutaneous feature of lightning stroke is known as feathering/lightning prints/ Arborescent/ Filigree burns It comprises of linear, fernlike, superficial skin markings (also called keraunographic marks) that may disappear after 1-2 days. These cutaneous manifestations of lightning injury usually consist of erythematous streaks that do not blanch on diascopy. They are usually found over the shoulders or the flanks. Erythema begins to fade in 4-6 hours with no residual skin changes. This bizarre cutaneous manifestation is probably related to the flashover phenomenon, from the transmission of static electricity along the superficial vasculature. Recognition of this sign may save the life of an unaccompanied comatose patient and should signal the need for immediate resuscitation if a victim is not breathing and has no pulse.

Hemoperfusion is the technique of passing blood through a bed of paicles contained within a device to which blood lines and a blood pump are attached. It differs from hemodialysis in that blood comes in direct contact with the membrane coated sorbent paicle and not a continuous dialysis membrane, from plasma pharesis in that no plasma is separated from blood. Clinical indications of hemoperfusion: Poisoning (drug and chemical exposure), hepatic failure (drug induced, fulminant hepatic failure), treatment of uremia and its complications (aluminium toxicity). Poisoning by water soluble drugs such as lithium and chemicals which cause acidosis (methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylate) are best treated with hemodialysis.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Cooling of body ALGOR MOIS After death, dead body behaves like an ine substance and therefore, if atmospheric temperature is low, body loses its heat by conduction, covection, radiation and evoporation, so as to attain the atmospheric temperature, i.e. the body cools. No cooling of dead body occurs if atmospheric temperature is higher than that of body. Cooling of body stas 1/2 to 1 hour after death. There are varying opinions about rate of cooling of dead body: i) Most widely accepted view is that the rate of cooling in india (tropical countries) is 0.5-0.7deg C/hour, so that body attains atmospheric temperature in 16-20 hours after death. In temperate climate, the rate of fall is about 1.5deg C/hour. ii) As per another view, cooling is faster in initial period, when the temprature difference between body and atmosphere is maximum ? First 30-45 minutes --> No temperature fall (isothermic phase). First 1-6 hours --4 1.5-2deg C/hour. 6-12 hours 0.9-1.2deg C/hour. After 12 hours ---> 0.4-0.6deg C/hour. iii) Rate of cooling is related to difference in temperature and its surroundings (environment). In the first 2 hours average rate fall of temperature is roughly half this difference. In next 2 hours the temperature fall is at half this rate and in subsequent 2 hours, at quaer this rate. iv) Most common site for recording temperature is the rectum. Thermameter is inseed in rectum around 8-10 cm for 2 minutes. Other sites for recording tempeure are nose, ear (external auditory meatus), vagina and under liver. Medicolegal impoance of algor mois - i) It is a sign of death. ii) Time since death may be determined and and algor mois is the most impoant indicator to determine the time since death during first 24 hours.",

All of these are replaced with a permanent counterpa except for the first and second molars; they are replaced by premolars. The deciduous teeth will remain until the age of six. At that time, the permanent teeth sta to appear in the mouth resulting in mixed dentition. The erupting permanent teeth causes root resorption, where the permanent teeth push down on the roots of the deciduous teeth causing the roots to be dissolved and become absorbed by the forming permanent teeth. Mixed dentition is seen upto the age of 12 years and at 14 years there are 28 permanent teeth and no deciduous teeths.",

Forced diuresis may be of following types :? 1) Alkaline diuresis : Poisons which are trapped and excreted in alkaline urine are barbiturates (phenobarbitone), chlorpropamide, diffunisol, sulfonamides and salicylates. 2) Acid diuresis : It is done for amphetamines, cocaine, strychnine, phencyclidine, quinidine, quinine, chloroquine, TCA and tocainide. 3) Saline diuresis : It is useful for alcohol, thallium, bromide, lithium, fluoride, chromium, potassium and isoniazide. B) Extracorporal removal therapies These are peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion (resin or charcol), hemofiltration, plasmapheresis and exchange transfusion. Commonly used procedures are :? 1) Haemodialysis : It is useful in poisoning with alcohol (ethanol and methanol), aspirin (salicylates), acetone, atenolol, acetaminophen, barbiturates (phenobarbitone), bromide, boric acid, chloral hydrate, ethylene glycol, fluoride, lithium, trivalent arsenic, procainamide, theophylline, thiocyanate, sodium chlorate and sotalol. Hemodialysis is not useful in copper sulphate, benzodiazepines, organophosphates, kerosine and digitalis poisonings.

        "exp": "The patient with a positive history of working in a factory and now having presented with the classical symptoms (excessive salivation, tremors, disturbed personality and blue lines on gums) points towards the diagnosis of chronic mercury poisoning. The mercury poisoning can occur from various mercuric compounds. They are Mercuric chloride, Mercuric oxide, Mercuric oxide, Mercuric cyanide, Mercuric sulphide, Mercuric nitrite, Mercuric sulphate, Mercurous chloride, Sulphate of mercury, Ammoniomercuric chloride and organic compunds of mercury. Elemental mercury is found in glass thermometers, electrical switches, fluorescent light bulbs, older dental fillings and few medical equipments. Inorganic mercury is found in batteries, chemistry labs, disinfectants, folk culture medicines and red cinnabar mineral. Organic mercury is found in older germ-killers (antiseptics), thimerosal, fumes from burning coal and in a few fishes that have consumed organic mercury. Mercury poisoning can occur as acute poisoning or chronic poisoning. The mercuric ion tends to bind with the sulphydryl groups of cellular proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids and mitotic apparatus thus interferes with the cellular and enzymatic functions. Renal tubular function get affected and in the pas of the central nervous system that are mainly targeted are cerebellum, basal ganglia, temporal lobe and corpus callosum. In acute poisoning the symptoms are bronchitis, constriction in throat, hoarse voice, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, fibrosis, abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, blood stained diarrhea, glossitis, ulcerative gingivitis, renal tubular necrosis, cylinduria, uraemia and acidosis. Chronic mercury poisoning is also known as hydrargyrism. The common symptoms are sore mouth, gingivitis, salivation, formation of blue lines at the junction with teeth (Buonian line), Danbury tremors, Glass blower's shakes (hatter's shakes), Concussio mercurialis, Mercurial erethism, Mercuria lentis (brownish deposition of mercury on anterior lens capsule) and Acrodynia or pink disease.

Again permanent does not mean that it should be incurableQ. For example, when loss of sight is due to corneal opacity due to some injury, it is curable by corneoplasty.

Grevious hu is a cognizable offence for which a police officer can arrest a person without a warrant from magistrateQ.

        "exp": "Ans. C: Hypothermia Cocaine when ingested results in hypehermia, hallucinations, euphoria and stimulation of libido Cocaine intoxication With excessive or prolonged use, the drug can cause itching, tachcardia, hallucinations and paranoid delusions. Overdoses cause tachyarrythmias and a marked elevation of blood pressure, which can be life-threatening. Toxicity results in seizures, followed by respiratory and circulatory depression of medullar origin. This may lead to death from respiratory failure, stroke, or hea-failure. Cocaine is also highly pyrogenic, because the stimulation and increased muscular activity cause greater heat production. Heat loss is inhibited by the intense vasoconstriction. Cocaine-induced hypehermia may cause muscle cell destruction and myoglobinuria resulting in renal failure. Emergency treatment often consists of administering a benzodiazepine sedation agent, such as diazepam to decrease the elevated hea rate and blood pressure. Physical cooling (ice, cold blankets, etc.) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used to treat hypehermia There is no officially approved specific antodote for cocaine overdose Cocaine's primary acute effect on brain chemistry is to raise the amount of dopamine and serotonin in the nucleus accumbens (the pleasure center in the brain); this effect ceases, due to metabolism of cocaine to inactive compounds and paicularly due to the depletion of the transmitter resources (tachyplaxis). This can be experienced acutely as feelings of depression, as a \"crash\" after the initial high.",
