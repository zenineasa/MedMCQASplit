Krait is the most common poisonous snake in india. These have minimal reaction locally, but produce strong neurotoxicity. They act on motor nerve cells, resembling poisoning with curare. There is weakness of legs and face. Muscle paralysis occurs in following order :- mouth (first) followed by throat and finally respiratory muscles. Cobra venom also produces convulsions (krait venom produces only paralysis). B. Vasculotoxic (hematotoxic) It includes vipers. Viper venom contains hemolysins and thromboplasin which cause widspread endothelial damage and hemolysis. Locally at the site of bite, there is severe oozing of blood. There may be coagulation abnormalities with death due to hemorrhagic shock. Hematuria and hemoglobinuria occurs due to hemolysis. C. Myotoxic (musculotoxic) These are sea snakes. Their venom produces generalized muscle pain, weakness, followed by polymyositis,myoglobinuria, hyperkalemia and increased muscle enzymes. Finally there is respiratory and renal failure.",

Nature of stain (whether the stain is blood or not) To determine the nature of stain, following tests are used : 1. Chemical tests These tests are based on the peroxidase activity of haematin, which is, derived from oxidation of haem of haemoglobin or methemoglobin, present. This enzyme, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide conves colourless salts into coloured bases. Thus these tests are based on H202 and peroxidase enzyme. Tests are : Benzidine test: Greenish blue colour. Phenolphthalein test (kastle myere test) : Deep permanganate colour. Leucomalachite green test : Bluish green or peacock blue colour. Guaiacum test : Blue colour. Ohotoludine test (kohn test) : Blue or green colour. Amidopyrine test : Purple colour. 2. Microchemical tests These tests are based on propey of haem pa of hemoglobin to form characteristic coloured crystals. The tests are : Teichmann's haemin crystal test. Takayama hemochromogen crystal test. Luminal spray test : It is especially useful in old obscure blood stains. Spetroscopy It is most delicate and reliable test. It is based on the principle that hemoglobin and its derivatives give characteristic absorption bands when viewed through a spectroscope. 4. Microscopy Microscopic examination of RBCs is possible only in fresh stains. Detection of species (whether the blood has come from human or animal) For detection of species, serological (immunological) tests are used. These tests are : Precipitin test Haemaglutination inhibition test (antiglobulin consumption test or absorption inhibition test). Gel diffusion test. Double diffusion test. Precipitation electrophoresis. Latex agglutination test. Isoenzyme method (enzymological test). Detection of blood group of blood stain These tests are : Immunological (serological) : (i) aborption-elution test, (ii) absorption-inhibition test, (iii) mixed agglutination test, (iv) latex test.

Arsenic poisoning may be acute or chronic. Acute arsenic poisoning It can present in any of the two ways : Gastrointestinal type : It is the common form and resembles bacterial gastroenteritis (e.g. cholera). There is garlic adour with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and necrosis of intestinal mucosa. There is tenesmus and anal irritation. Dehydration may cause acute circulatory collapse, with hypotension, oliguria and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Fulminant narcotic form : Large dose of arsenic is rapidly absorbed without producing GI symptoms. These are giddiness, headache, myalgia, formication, veigo and death in 2-3 hours. Postmoem appearance include : Red velvety mucosa of stomach and submucous petechial haemorrhage. Subendocardial petechial haemorrhage. Fatty degeneration of liver, kidney and hea. Chronic arsenic poisoning Chronic arsenic poisoning has four stages : First stage (nutritional and gastrointestinal disturbances) : The earliest sign is gradual emaciation. There is loss of appetite, nausea and intermittent vomiting and diarrhea. Second stage (catarrhal changes) : It resembles common cold, i.e. conjunctivitis, running nose and eyes, coughing etc. Third stage (skin rash) : There is classical 'rain drop pigmentation', i.e. patchy brown pigmentation of skin. At initial stages, there is a vesicular eruption which may resemble nettle rash. Hyperkeratosis of palms and soles occur. There are white transverse bands crossing the nails, known as Mee's line, and indicate periods of arrested growth due to interference with normal metabolism. There is alopecia and exfoliative dermatitis. Fouh stage (nervous disturbances) : There is sensory and motor (i.e. mixed) polyneuropathy, with painful paresthesia of hands and feet and muscle tenderness. There may be evidence of liver (fatty liver) and kidney damage and bone marrow suppression (causing anemia and other cytopenias). Hea may also be involved. Chronic arsenic exposure can also cause 'black foot disease' a severe form of peripheral vascular disease, causing gangrene of lower limbs.

Depending upon the method used to constrict the neck, strangulation can be divided into : Ligature strangulation : Neck is compressed by a ligature of which usually multiple rounds are given and no knot is tied. Throttling (manual strangulation) : Neck is compressed by one or both hands. When neck is compressed by two palms, it is known as palmar strangulation. Bansdola : Compression of neck with one or two wooden sticks or bamboo. Garrotting : It is compression of neck by a rope thrown from behind. Spanish windlass is a type of garrotting, which used to be the official mode of execution in spain. In this, an iron collor around the neck was tightened by a screw for strangulation.

First stage of nutritional and gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhoea is common) Third stage (of skin rashes) shows white bands known as Mees line crossing the nail of fingers and toes In addition to this, there may be evidence of liver damage, kidney damage and bone marrow depression at some stage Arsenic poisoning Increased levels of the element arsenic in the body. Arsenic interferes with cellular longevity by allosteric inhibition of an essential metabolic enzyme. Symptoms of arsenic poisoning include headache, confusion, convulsion, diarrhea, vomiting, and in severe case coma and death Routes of exposure include contaminated water, air, and food. Occupational exposure to arsenic may occur with copper or lead smelting and wood treatment and among workers involved in the production or application of pesticides Symptoms of arsenic poisoning begin with headaches, confusion, severe diarrhea, and drowsiness. As the poisoning develops, convulsions and changes in fingernail pigmentation called leukonychia may occur. When the poisoning becomes acute, symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, blood in the urine, cramping muscles, hair loss, stomach pain, and more convulsions. The organs of the body that are usually affected by arsenic poisoning are the lungs, skin, kidneys, and liver. Chronic arsenic exposure can remain in the body systems for a longer period of time than a shoer term or more isolated exposure and can be detected in a longer time frame after the introduction of the arsenic, impoant in trying to determine the source of the exposure. Hair is a potential bioindicator for arsenic exposure due to its ability to store trace elements from blood. Incorporated elements maintain their position during growth of hair. Thus for a temporal estimation of exposure, an assay of hair composition needs to be carried out with a single hair which is not possible with older techniques requiring homogenization and dissolution of several strands of hair. This type of biomonitoring has been achieved with newer microanalytical techniques like Synchroton radiation based X ray fluorescence (SXRF) spectroscopy and Micropaicle induced X ray emission (PIXE). Dimercaprol and dimercaptosuccinic acid are chelating agents which sequester the arsenic away from blood proteins and are used in treating acute arsenic poisoning. The most impoant side effect is hypeension. Dimercaprol is considerably more toxic than succimer",

There is weakness of legs and face. Muscle paralysis occurs in following order :- mouth (first) followed by throat and finally respiratory muscles. Cobra venom also produces convulsions (krait venom produces only paralysis). B. Vasculotoxic (hematotoxic) It includes vipers. Viper venom contains hemolysins and thromboplasin which cause widspread endothelial damage and hemolysis. Locally at the site of bite, there is severe oozing of blood. There may be coagulation abnormalities with death due to hemorrhagic shock. Hematuria and hemoglobinuria occurs due to hemolysis. C. Myotoxic (musculotoxic) These are sea snakes.

This is known as conduct money Conduct money It is money paid in some legal systems to a person under the compulsion of a summons to witness/ subpoena to pay for their expenses to attend in cou. It generally incorporates a daily rate for each day the witness must attend in cou (with a one-day minimum), plus a travel allowance to allow the witness to get to the place of the hearing. Generally, conduct money must be delivered with the summons for it to have legal effect. Witnesses are generally entitled to additional conduct money if their attendance is required on more days than anticipated. Moreover, witnesses who are required to make an overnight stay to attend in cou on more than one day are generally entitled to an allowance for accommodation and meals. The rates for travel, daily attendance, accommodation and meals are generally set under a cou tariff, and are fixed for all witnesses. A witness may not refuse to appear merely because they believe the conduct money is insufficient to make up for their lost wages or actual travel expenses. Witnesses may be paid more, but the additional cost cannot be claimed against the losing pay - only the tariff amount can be recovered. Occasionally, special witnesses, such as expes, may be entitled to receive conduct money under a higher tariff.",

CO binds to hemoglobin with an affinity 250 times that of oxygen, resulting in reduced oxyhemoglobin saturation and decreased blood oxygen-carrying capacity. CO may also directly inhibit cytochrome oxidase, fuher disrupting cellular function, and it is known to bind to myoglobin, possibly contributing to impaired myocardial contractility. Symptoms of intoxication are predominantly in organs with high oxygen consumption, such as the brain and hea. The majority of patients describe headache, dizziness, and nausea. Patients with coronary disease may experience angina or myocardial infarction. With more severe exposures, impaired thinking, syncope, coma, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and death may occur. Cerebral edema (swelling of the brain) is also a common result of severe carbon monoxide poisoning. Survivors of serious poisoning may experience numerous ove neurologic sequelae consistent with a hypoxic-ischemic insult, ranging from gross deficits such as parkinsonism and a persistent vegetative state to subtler personality and memory disorders.

These walls have mucosal folds resembling branches of a tree so are known as arbor vitae uteri. These folds are lost after child bih giving a conical shape to the cervical canal. So, Nulliparous External os Circular Cervical canal Fusiform longitudinally & transverse horizontally Multiparous Transverse/slit like Conical",

During lightening, injuries result due to following mechanisms :- Direct effect of high voltage current. Heat, i.e. super heated air causing burns. Expanded and displaced air, which acts as a blast wave. Sledge hammer blow by compressed air pushed before the current (sledge hammer effect and blow death). The characteristic finding in lightening burns is filigree burns/ arborescent burns/arborescent marking/ litchenberg flower.

Doctrine of paial responsibility - If a person is suffering from some weakness or aberration of mind (though not completely insane), he is only paially responsible for his actions, e.g. obsession states or depressions. 3. Durhan rule- Accused is not responsible for the act, if his act resulted from mental disease or defect. 4. Currens rule- A person is not responsible if at the time of committing the crime, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct according to the requirements of law, as a result of his mental disease or defect. 5.

        "exp": "inhibits cytochrome a oxidase Aluminium phosphide produces phosphine gas on coming in contact with moisture which inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (and not cytochrome a oxidase). Sub-endocardial infarction and esophageal strictures both have been described with ALP poisoning (Ref: various journals on web) Aluminium phosphide poisoning It is one of the most common causes of acute poisoning in India. Acute aluminium phosphide (Celphos) poisoning is an extremely lethal poisoning. The absence of a specific antidote results in very high moality and the key to treatment lies in rapid decontamination and institution of resuscitative measures. Aluminium phosphide (A1P) is one of the most commonly used grain fumigants because of its propeies which are considered to be near ideal; it is toxic to all stages of insects, highly potent, does not affect seed bility, is free from toxic residues. After ingestion of aluminium phosphide, phosphine gas is released in the stomach which after absorption into the circulation results in early signs and symptoms. AlP causes widespread organ damage due to cellular hypoxia as a consequence of non-competitive inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase of the mitochondria. Organs with the greatest oxygen requirements appear to be especially sensitive to phosphine, including the brain, kidneys, hea, and liver. The initial symptoms after ingestion are retrosternal burning, epigastric pain and vomiting which are soon followed by development of hypotension which is the cardinal feature. Other common features are restlessness, tachypnoea, oliguria or anuria, jaundice, impaired sensorium and cardiac arrhythmias. Several EKG abnormalities have been described. These have been attributed to focal myocardial necrosis and changes in action membrane potential as result of alteration in permeability of Na+, Mg++ and Ca+ ions Diagnosis A positive history of ingestion is the basis of diagnosis in most cases. The presence of typical clinical features, garlicky (or decaying fish) odour from the mouth and highly variable arrhythmias in a young patient with shock and no previous history of cardiac disease points towards aluminium phosphide poisoning. Confirmation can be done by the Silver Nitrate Test. In this test, 5 ml of gastric aspirate and 15 ml of water are put in a flask and the mouth of the flask is covered by filter paper impregnated with 0.1N silver nitrate. The flask is heated at 50 o C for 15 to 20 min. If phosphine is present the filter paper turns black. However the most specific and sensitive method for detecting the presence of P1-13 in blood/air is gas chromatography. (Vies Jansen A, Thrane KE. Gas chromatographic determination of PH3 in ambient air. Analysis 1978;103:1195-8.) Management The management continues to be unsatisfactory as there is no specific antidote and remains suppoive only. The most impoant factor for success is resuscitation of shock and institution of suppoive measures as soon as possible. To reduce the absorption of phosphine, gastric lavage with potassium permanganate (1:10,000) is done. Permanganate is used as it oxidizes PH3 to form non-toxic phosphate. This is followed by a slurry of activated charcoal (approximately 100 gin) given through a nasogastric tube. A cathaic (liquid paraffin) is given to accelerate the excretion of aluminium phosphide and phosphine. Antacids and proton pump blockers are added for symptomatic relief.",
