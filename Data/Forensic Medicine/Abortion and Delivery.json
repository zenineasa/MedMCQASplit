The most common cause of such rigor mortis is antenatal haemorrhage.MacerationIf the dead fetus remains for some time in the uterus surrounded by liquor amnii but without air, an aseptic autolysis of the foetus occurs. This is known as macerationMummificationIt occurs when death of a foetus results from a deficient supply of blood or when liquor amnii is scanty and when no air has entered the uterus.
