# MedMCQA -- Split

This project contains MedMCQA databaset which I originally obtained from [github.com/MedMCQA/MedMCQA](https://github.com/MedMCQA/MedMCQA). The original data has been extracted into several files and stored in a folder hierarchy that is in accordance with the subject and topic names mentioned in the original dataset.

If you use this dataset or paper in your research, please cite the original authors using the following bibtex code:

  abstract = 	 {This paper introduces MedMCQA, a new large-scale, Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) dataset designed to address real-world medical entrance exam questions. More than 194k high-quality AIIMS & NEET PG entrance exam MCQs covering 2.4k healthcare topics and 21 medical subjects are collected with an average token length of 12.77 and high topical diversity. Each sample contains a question, correct answer(s), and other options which requires a deeper language understanding as it tests the 10+ reasoning abilities of a model across a wide range of medical subjects & topics. A detailed explanation of the solution, along with the above information, is provided in this study.}
